    <h1>School (and Work) Time!</h1>
    <h2> Go back to School! After the celebrations and other fun stuff, you can go back to
        school where you get bored a lot, sleep a lot and try to not fail your grades and
        most imporantly, your <b><i>PARENTS</i></b> and others i guess.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Go do homework, activities, quizzes/tests and performance tasks for learning! You
        will totally enjoy it! Maybe discover new possibilities or barely pass, its fine,
        you'll totally pass next quarter, and next year, next grade, next life!
    </h2>
    <h2>
        For people that don't have school, either you are a person who has work to do or
        is looking for a job, either way have fun with your responsibilities, taxes and 
        other stressing stuff, i can't care about (<i>i'm slowly getting there :{</i> )
    </h2>
    <h3>So, more content? NO! definitely not, i have a lot of schoolwork to do, i might
        do a project there and here, but this will be the page for most of the time...
