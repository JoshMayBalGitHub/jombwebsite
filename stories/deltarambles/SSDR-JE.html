## Mains:

On a dark morning, as Jeanne steps out of the royal castle, slowly to not catch attention to her aides and maids, and since she was supposed to be sleeping, they didn't check her room, for now. As she heads out, she is soaked by the heavy rain before looking over the nearby hill, there was a vast field of flowers that were wilted and sparse now. All she could do was simply run away from the floating palace and towards the field as her royal clothes were further soaked.

"I don't know what I should do, but all I know is I must escape them, no matter what." said Jeanne to herself as she ran away as fast as she could in the rain. For a while, she managed to run far away but eventually she tripped over a pebble and fell on her face, her beard disguise falling off as she was knocked out temporarily.

She is awoken by a strange non-elven figure, with curly hair and pale skin. His green eyes look at her body, very concerned. "Hey, um.. You good? You seem to have fallen over during the rain.." said Elliot with a dutch accent. "H—huh!? W—Who are you?!" questioned Jeanne, suddenly jolting away from Elliot. "Oh, Ik ben Elliot a.k.a. Elle, a.. wanderer. Here's my Knuffel named Teroen, and Leuk om je te ontmoeten!" answered Elliot, before Jeanne tilts her head to the left, confused. "What..? What are you saying? I just speak Elvingish. The one spoken by.. my people, who are you? You don't look like an elf." responded Jeanne, still confused.

"Oh, ah.. Well, I am.. a human, you guys have that..? Yeah, I just.. so happened to find an elven? girl around here." said Elliot as Jeanne is even more confused and asks, "A human? What's that?"

"Oh, you don't know..? Uh, it's a.. rare species of elven.." said Elliot, as Jeanne narrows her eyes and responds, "Oh.. really? Hmm.. I haven't seen anything like you, or anyone else.. for that matter. But.. you seem trustworthy." Jeanne then relaxed herself as she stood up. "Oh.. bedankt.." muttered Elliot to himself as Jeanne questioned, "Hmm? What you say?" 

"Oh nothing. Anyways, shall we?" said Elliot as he offered his hand to Jeanne. Jeanne accepted and they started walking in the forest they found themselves in. "So.. do you have any reason why you're here? I can't imagine what an elf would do during a heavy rain." asked Elliot, before Jeanne responded, "Um.. I.." Jeanne hesitates, not knowing what to say or if she should tell a friend she just met her reason.

"Oh, I guess.. it'd be a bit early to say, so why don't we just hang out..? Is that the term.. For a while.. There should be civilization somewhere, or some house since you definitely come from somewhere, right?" said Elliot, as Jeanne nodded and they continued walking until they found a village, full of people.

"Oh, here we are. Civilization.. Hey, hold on.. Aren't those humans?" asked Elliot, as Jeanne is surprised at the amount of non-elves. "H—huh? So, is this more of your kind?" asked Jeanne before Elliot responded, "Uh.. yeah! Totally.. I have never met them though."

"You've never..? Aren't you a wanderer or something?" questioned Jeanne as Elliot is stumbling on his words. "Oh, so you.. *sigh* I knew it.. What are you, really?" asked Jeanne, moving away from Elliot. "It's not that interesting, I was just an orphan from a different world, a normal human. I got transported here after I touched a grave in a cemetery.. I don't know why it put me here.. But here I am." answered Elliot, more somber.

"Oh? A different world? What.. I don't believe you.." said Jeanne in disbelief. "It's true.. I am really glad to be here.. The place where I am from is not a very good one." responded Elliot as they arrived at a library. "Oh, this is a library, I might learn something new." said Elliot as they were stopped by a human guard.

"Stop there. I'll check you for any dangerous items you might have." said the human guard as he first checked Elliot. He first checked Elliot's teddy and his clothes. "Good, no magic it seems. You're allowed. Let's check the elven girl.. royalty.. huh?" said the human guard as he checks Jeanne. "Ok you're both good. You can enter now." continued the human guard as he let them in the library.

"Why is there a guard for a library.. in a village..? Having a library makes no sense either.." remarked Elliot, as Jeanne responded, "I guess..? I've never been inside a village library.. This feels more.. poor, than my castle library." said Jeanne as they both looked at the selection.

"You have a castle library? You're actually a royal..?" asked Elliot, with a surprised face. "Yeah yeah.. I am.. one.. But.. I've never been outside the castle before.. I've always been told to stay inside.. So, even if I am a royal.. I.. don't see myself as one." answered Jeanne, as they saw a book that they were both interested in. "Ooh! It's a.. uh.. a book on elven royalty..? I guess it'll be nice to figure out your relatives, Jeanne?" remarked Elliot, as Jeanne nodded and opened the book, dusting it off, before they placed it on a table and sat down.

As they were reading the book, they saw a familiar name. "Wait! Jeanne. There's your name here. Jeanne Quirois.. Definitely French haha.." commented Elliot, as Jeanne ignored his confusing statement and instead looked at her information. "Uh.. what.. What..? WHAT?!" said Jeanne as she looked at the book, revealing her half-elf lineage. "I am.. not.. a full elf..?" continued Jeanne, with trembling in her voice.

"Oh..? There's half-elves? Wow.." said Elliot, as Jeanne closes the book, and looks at the cover, processing what she just read. "T—then.. t—that's why.. f—father always looked at me differently.. He always despised me for some reason, and when we were alone.. He kept telling me.. I am lucky that I wasn't thrown away when I was born.." said Jeanne, as tears fell from her eyes. "What?! That.. sucks.. I wish I could.. relate.. or give comfort.." said Elliot, choosing his words carefully, trying not to burden Jeanne.

Then suddenly the door opens behind them, and it's Jeanne's mother, part of the royalty. "Jeanne." said the mother as elven royal guards, surrounded her. "We need to talk." said the mother as Elliot stepped back from Jeanne, as the mother went closer to Jeanne with her guards. "You are a half-elf.. I made it that way.. Now, keep it to yourself.. Return to the castle, now." whispered the mother to Jeanne, as Jeanne felt dizzy and lightheaded, as she fell to her mother's arms, going unconscious.

She woke up in a familiar place, her room. As the rain was pouring in, again. She groggily got out of bed and looked outside of her window, feeling something was missing. Suddenly, the memories of the previous events flash back to her, as she held her head in shock and pain as Elliot and her mother's revelation to her came back to her memory, forcefully. After a while, it stopped, bringing her back to her present time.

"What.. the..? I am.. a half elf..? Who's this Elliot? What are these memories..?" questioned Jeanne to herself, as she remembered her escape plan. "Oh, right.. It's raining today, it's time for my escape.. Hmm, if I remember correctly, these memories must be.. from when I escaped..? But why am I here..? I better check the library first." continued Jeanne as she walked to the castle's library, greeting her maids like nothing happened. 

She walked to the castle library where she picked out a book that she was using as her secret diary, originally a book about elven royalty that the author left half of the pages left out, for the future royals, that's unused so they put it in the back of the library, but Jeanne soon found it and so used it, since she knew that her parents always made the maids check her room, but they don't check the library so she uses it as her safe place.

"Ok ok.. So, here's my.. huh.. this is my exact plan. Well, if they put me back here, I guess I'll go again. Hmm, should I bring this? No, it doesn't matter if they find it, I won't let myself be found." said Jeanne, feeling a sense of deja-vu from that statement. "Huh.. weird.. Anyways, I should go, now!" said Jeanne as she put her book back, grabbed her beard disguise then sneaked out of the castle.

Jeanne tip-toes out of the royal castle, very slowly to not catch attention of her aides and maids, and since she was supposed to be sleeping, after she went back to her room, making sure the maids noticed. They didn't check her room again. As she went out, she was soaked by the rain before looking over the nearby hill, there was a vast field of flowers that were wilted and sparse currently. All she could do was simply run away again from the floating palace and towards the field as her royal clothes were further soaked.

"I don't know why I am doing this.. But, all I know is I have to do this." said Jeanne to herself as she ran away as fast as she could in the rain. For a while, she managed to run far away but eventually she tripped over a pebble and fell on her face, her beard disguise falling off as she was knocked out temporarily.

She is awoken by a strange non-elven figure, with curly hair and pale skin. His green eyes look at her body, very concerned. "Hey, Are you fine? You had fallen over during the rain.." said Elliot with a dutch accent. "Elle..? Is that you..?" said Jeanne, waking up groggily. "Elle..? So.. you remember me?" asked Elliot, as Jeanne nodded then tried to process her surroundings. "Wow.. So.. you remember how you just suddenly fainted? I didn't know what to do as I was brought back here, as it rained.. I was here after the rain, but.. after that.. reset? I don't know.." continued Elliot, as Jeanne fully woke up and processed Elliot's words. "Reset..? Wait.. So, this.. already happened..? Because I remember meeting you already, and going to this town.." questioned Jeanne, as Elliot worryingly nodded.

"I guess..? Hold your horses, we need to find a way out of this world. Because.. if this is how it's going to happen, we'll be stuck in a loop. We need to find a way to break it." said Elliot, with a thoughtful look. "I agree. But how to start..? Sorry, I don't know much about this whole thing.." responded Jeanne with a disappointed look.

"Don't worry. I'll find a way. I'll uh.. I don't know.. actually.. Hmm, maybe Teroen has an idea..?" said Elliot as he looked at the teddy bear, with a pleading face. "Does it talk..?" questioned Jeanne as Elliot looked at her with an unsure face. "He uh.. I don't know.. But I've never seen him talk to other people.." answered Elliot, as Jeanne looked at him unamused.

"Jeanne.. You.. uh understand right? I just teleported into this world, so I don't know what to do.. How about you?" asked Elliot, as Jeanne shook her head. "I don't know either! I.. have been inside all the time.. I don't know what to do if my life is turned around like this.. I just.. hoped that once I escaped, I'll get an idea or learn something new.. But.. All I learned is how locked inside I am.." answered Jeanne, as Elliot patted her shoulder, feeling lost.

"I.. don't know what to say.." said Elliot, as he thought of a way to continue. "Follow me. We'll go to where I was teleported, maybe I didn't notice anything when I arrived since it was raining." said Elliot, as he walked away. Jeanne followed him soon after, not knowing what to do anyway.

They walked for a while, before Elliot stopped at a random place in the forest, as he searched around for any clues.

"I hope that.. there's something here.. Call me if you find anything interesting."
