    ## DeltaRambles DC: Across the Pages

## Intro

Looking back, to look forward. Oh, and to have some comments on my creative journey, and what's been the progress since 'Black Christmas'.. It can be found in the new Metapsilon Archives! I'll explain with more detail later, as I introduce you to the new year's devlog! Table of Contents is also below.

I'll be taking a brief look at my thoughts on what DeltaRambles will mean to me for the foreseeable future, my current fanfics' progress and what have I been doing overall in the creative processes, and the connection to the eccentricity of even having a website for these types of works.

## The Metapsilon Archives

So, what even is this new archive that needed a whole section of its own? Well, in short, as said in the webpage itself;

> Articles/Stories older than a year that has been deemed important enough to archive, but not enough to be front and center at the normal navigator!

I have been thinking about figuring out what to 	do with stuff that shouldn't be **overtaking** space of my more **developed** work. Such as my older commentaries, older spinoffs and older drafts that no longer fit the current vision of the current story. Of course, the *vision* changes over time, so it isn't necessarily set in stone what is to be thrown to the archive and what stays as a *'main'* thing to look at. After all, you're looking at a webnovel, things can be **changed** because of a whim from the website owner, and luckily, *I am* the website owner... Well, **supposedly** anyway. Both websites (normal and BS-type) are stored in other people's servers anyway, but the point is that I also control the design and look.

Looking from it from a reader's perspective, I couldn't put my more **personal** yet unrelated works into someone's website just because its vaguely connected to the story. So when I finish **my** story, I am open to hosting it somewhere **more** popular, but until that happens, it's going to **stay** here. So, in my **own** website, I can put everything and don't have to worry **much** about what people think because unless they email or post at my GitLab issues, it doesn't exist to me. So, an audience can't exist because I can't observe what they'd say or how'd they interact with me.

I.. don't know *why* I got there, but the point of the **rambling** is that I have my own website, and with that, I have to **also** think about the future and how a viewer might navigate it. It's not entirely *phantom theoretical viewers* I do this for by the way, but to get more than *'oh, this feels weird'* from them is asking **too much** from friends and family that don't share as much of a **passion** with web design and creative writing like me. But yeah, an archive for stuff that makes it actually able to be somewhat non-destructive in terms of maintaining history of itself.

**~~(git is already a great tool for this, but.. ahem, can lead to unintended circumstances, looking at you.. BS..)~~**

## Chainsaw Woman and Other Anime-based Fanfics

So, I have been working on that from time to time, but damn is school getting in the way of the most peak story that I have to write. I need to immerse myself in it but holy is it hard. Sorry, I just have to emphasize how hard it is. Like, I'm at Chapter 2 of the AsaDen Public Safety: Asa Mitaka fanfic and fuck, WHY CAN'T I JUST BE FASTER?! Like, half of it is just dedicated to working in manga scenes to fit my fic, and that means the characters saying the same stuff so already, you can forgive myself for getting bored but like-!!!

OTHER ANIME EXIST TOO!!!! I CAN'T JUST OBSESS OVER CHAINSAW MAN!! UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO BE LIKE MY PANDEMIC SELF BUT GAHHH!!

I can see why Ao3 authors often just go months without posting anything then suddenly come back with a fanfic to an unrelated fandom, or even a new oneshot or a completely new series like... HOW????? It's genuinely exhausting. I never thought I'd have a hard time making time to write when these days are way easier for the body and mind (not much easier, but compared to previous months of angst hell I can breathe). Especially since Chainsaw Man Manga is nearing either Part 2's completion or the complete end of it. Like, are you meaning to tell me, it'll be like.. what months from now that Chainsaw Man will lose focus for people due to it's manga ending and the next anime being like given (enough) time to cook?! FUCK I know what it feels to be in a fandom where the series itself is over and the author is writing something completely unrelated!! (like.. AoT??)

### Specific Struggles on Writing Asa Mitaka and Yoru, the War Devil

Asa's backstory is really hard to figure out how to write in without reading through the manga specifically which I kinda want to, but at the same time, I can't just begin to re-read Part 2 if I'm still writing through Part 1, so I use the wiki but ehhh.. I also don't know if my Yoru fits canon or is too soft?? I know she's like a. 'fraud' to people used to Makima-style villainy but even then, writing how Yoru survives her being dragged to basically be in-danger of being executed by her horsemen sister.. While giving enough motivation to not make her crash out or die at any point to let her develop with Asa.. While not completely removing why she's so toxic to Asa's life, but at the same time, letting Denji experience his story, and letting canon happen, and et cetera.

Like, I cannot for the life of me, know what Aki and Himeno would do with Asa, who due to how I wrote it, would deal with Asa.. Like, we can see brief glimpses with Himeno and Aki with the others sharing traits, but adding like Asa, as she's like.. containing such a powerful weapon (Yoru) and pursuing the Gun Devil (Yoru's secondary goal).. then the dynamic with Denji, it's just like... YES! THAT'S THE POINT, BUT WHERE CAN I JUST.. INSERT ASA OR SOMETHING RATHER than.. having to also write the manga in a way that describes just enough to people not that immersed in too much of the dialogue to be able to follow the story and doesn't disappoint hardcore CSM fans by being either uncharacteristic or weird portraying of these characters.

Like, I'd read a fanfic or even manga doujinshi about them! I just didn't find anyone specifically doing it so I did it myself. But, it's just.. damn, do I really need to write out to the point where if someone discovers it off the cuff they'll be like, 'oh i like the concept, but [insert plot hole here]' so that I have to go back and rewrite stuff and gah!! I guess it's my fault for doing something so unprecedented no one else has something I can just yoink off of. Ugh, I just need to write, but time!! Damn you time!!!

Oh, and another thing, I am also nervous of writing romance as well, since its (Asa & Denji) a ship I like and soon it'll appear and I will need to figure it out too.. FUCK! Can I just skip forward to the scenes I want to write? But, eventually I have to write it though... ugh. Okay, but yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm still not confident of writing characters that are consistent but I'll.. try, and when it happens, I'll learn, y'know. But, getting through waves and oceans of self-doubt is like half of my damn day and so, its fighting through that to get to what I want that makes me.. ***keep moving forward.***

### One Punch Woman, and ideas on AoT, JJK, et cetera

Speaking of fanfiction, I have a tough time trying to figure out what to do next for these other animes. I mean, I can do oneshots, I can do short scenes, stories, I guess. But, as I write this article, it sure is taking me a long while to sit down and just type. I mean, my day goes as follows;

1. I wake up
2. Go to School
3. Go Home (Walking)
4. Chill (Too Much)
5. Rushed Writing Time! (both personal and school related)

So, even if I get ideas every day, I don't get the time to write them down into full fledged creative works. It's depressing, honestly. And, it's.. always tough to choose what to do, as you have probably guessed by now. Specifically, I'd want to write something about a specific mix of idea, a re-imagining of some scene, only to forget about it. It's really making me reconsider my entire schedule and attitude whenever I am free from obligations.

Finishing is half the pain of writing these fanfics honestly, um, though I've been writing a lot of **'half the (insert noun here)'** to express this. It's trying to figure out how to finish or move along a story that ends satisfyingly that I struggle with to this day, it's probably why I still can't have every day focused sessions when I'm so scared about the ending.

## DeltaRambles' Stagnation

*The world of DeltaRambles...*

Well, I don't mean to alarm anyone, but I'm not too sure what the fuck I've been doing with this series since I started other writing journeys. It's been hard to keep up with my own lore, as I've been captivated by other media nowadays as mentioned. But, I don't just.. suddenly run out of ideas, y'know. It's just.. well, when you have limited time to write, a lot of it, if you're really strapped for time, and want to feel satisfied, AI's there for you.

### Oooh, AI, spooky~!

AI, **AI,** ***AI***!

Well, LLM type. The Generative one. The one people most use. I.. wonder to myself if this has been stifling or freeing, as taking into account both writer wisdom and new technology advancements. I can see where it'd be bad to stop human ingenuity just by having AI do the **'hard work'** of well, writing. The sentence structure, word choices, and general voice of the writer all gets generated by something that as far as we know, uses algorithms to compile everyone else's writing. We're far more complex than algorithms. Especially in Creative Fiction Writing.

But, there tends to be a point where yes, it's blatantly AI, but it's readable enough with prompts and contexts that people are satisfied with that instead of making the big (admittedly time-consuming) effort to do it all on their own. I think I've talked about this before, but well, it's still happening. So, until it doesn't affect my writing, I'll keep mentioning it. Back to the point, that aspect of effort conflicts with the general societal norms of focused time and effort on school or work causing these specific type of hobbies to be more daunting to the average person. It also encourages more self-conscious and unskilled (in terms of being compared to masters of writing) writers to not try it and just let AI do it, since 'they weren't going to do it anyway'.

How this connects to me is a lot of my ideas get shoved into AI, and I have to either take back my idea and write it in a non-AI influenced way which is just normal writing with extra baggage or they're lost to the AI chat history, never appearing unless thought of again. I find this is the cycle that I've been placed in, as part of the current turbulent times of my life. I wish I can sit down, forego responsibilities and forge my world once more, but.. that's only a wish that can never be fulfilled in it's literal sense. And, it's more to do with my lifestyle and time-blindness interconnecting with AI's prevalence that further cements the stagnation of DeltaRambles and generally, original creation.

### What to do?

To be clear, I'm only talking about this because I've been struggling to progress the main story and refine my spinoff ideas. They certainly exist, and are published, but.. if that's all I pretty much have done, in a month.. What is to be looking forward to?

*I can't give an answer.*

There's only so much I can write in a night, or a week, as proven by this very first devlog. I've begun logging my writing sessions, just so I can figure out when I do these, and analyse it. As seen, mostly midnight. This is a key issue that I don't know how to fix. I have a great schedule, but.. I still go to a 'science' school, so.. the work doesn't become easier on me. For some reason, there's no difference between going home early or staying behind to chat with friends due to what I call, 'The Body Cycle of Disappointment'.

I can only really write, without much noise, feeling chill, and without distractions. That means no messages either. So, if my friends even have the decency to chat with me as a friend, I.. quickly lose focus and end up not doing anything. School doesn't end when the bells ring, it's unfair. Dealing with both relationships AND schoolwork drains me of any will to write, which is funny, 'cause half of character writing is dialogue but damn I also cannot just.. do nothing because something, and there will always be something to snap me back to the overstimulating reality.

*So.. DeltaRambles? What's going to happen to it?*

~~(I don't think you are mad about this but the devlog is also for me as well)~~

Same as usual. I'll write whenever I can. But with the aforementioned problems, forgive me for not being that... consistent? Not just in schedule, or output but the story themselves. Sometimes I worry that my work will never be fully condensed into a wiki for me to check since while I have notes, I do rely on vibes a lot. Yes, this is bad if the story has a plotline that keeps the characters in check, but what can ya do? If I have to triple-check every time then my fics will be done 10 years from now... An.. exaggeration, I do often check whenever I'm not sure, but unlike fanfics, I have to rely on myself to figure what lore I made, which is crazy since I don't write them down separately until I need to. I guess I'll start doing that? 

***Uh.. probably? Look, every future and past jmb somehow will have a different circumstance to how their writing session starts, and.. I wanna make sure that happens in the first place.***

### After Valentines Reflection

So, as you have gleaned from the timeline.. I.. slacked off on working on this and it's because of the spinoffs and stuff. I don't have much to say than what has been said, but you're going to see a different perspective of me due to the time difference.

I wonder to myself why I write these logs.. It's not for anyone else really. No one knows about these. In fact, I am probably the one that cares. I.. don't know how to feel about it. It's.. something that will feel off in the future, but right now feels freeing. I just wanna write about stuff and if it's coherent to someone? Cool. If not, then.. this is just my commentary, so.. not necessary. I.. have to learn to want sometimes.

There's a lot of restructuring shit that needs to happen. Obviously, I ain't got the time for it. But, there are small progress here and there. Fuck does it feel.. what's the word.. pensive? It's.. not that I'm disappointed since I know my limits, but at the same time, there's not much to be happy about. I dunno what makes me happy, actually. Writing feels like a compulsion, an impulse I must do than doing it because it's 'fun'. But, I'm not forced.. even with the description of it in the first place, I just.. don't know how to express the numbness of everyday life bleeding into my work.

## Conclusion

Wow, conclusion already? Yeah. I don't wanna extend this until it's time for the March Devlog, y'know? Besides, Feb 14 passed and I didn't get to make a special one so it's now here. I'm.. still mad I couldn't finish anything in what I think is a reasonable time frame. I just feel tired. I feel tired going through a lotta hassles and obstacles. There's been a lot of 'em. Can't blame me for that, I just gotta go through it. I wanna write something that speaks to someone but I think this specific piece has gone too far from the actual points I wanted to do here..

Metapsilon Archive is.. an archive of certain stuff I keep at the back for archive sake but doesn't represent me currently. The others are just yaps. If you like yapping (which, that's why you're here..?) then go read them, I don't remember why I said the words there so.. my interpretation is as different from the original as you. Hopefully, this gave you *any* insight. Goodbye, good day, and stay safe~!
