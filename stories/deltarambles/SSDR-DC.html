## The Intro...

Hello there, so it's like super late when I am writing this, around 02:00, Feb 19 2025.. You might be wondering, what is the point of this.. whole thing, or what I am going
to do, that is.. I.. it's the same thing. It's just me yapping about the story, while making sure to comment on any hiccups along the way. As explained in the spinoff; A
Valentine's Day, this is basically progress report, it doesn't count as an entirely separate article (i.e. outside the whole webnovel, game ideas, other rants, etc.) so
it is here now. If you are wondering, the old director's commentary about the oldest draft of season 1 is still in the code-base, I just haven't rewrriten it in this format,
and I don't have time (motivation too) to worry about old commentary of old drafts, while useful for archiving, I will make sure to specify if any changes, or any rewrites
are done. But, for example, I will modify some writing quirks, but the content (if I have grown from it, I wouldn't say it, let's say) will remain the same, if you don't
believe in that, then can't really do anything about that, use the git versioning system. Oh, and Author's Note will remain, and if I remember, will edit the commentaries
related, i.e. articles based on draft 2 of chapter 3 season 1 will specify what point in the beginning they are in, and likely mention the chapter. (links depends on
laziness of me that day)

## Other Commentaries

### Post Feb 14: Spinoff 'A Valentine's Day

I feel this one was quite a rare one to have been made. The circumstances that led to this making are radically different from previous days of this event. This day was when
I was mostly free, to think and to make something. While, procrastination and anxiety haunt me like a spectre, this one was a labor of.. haha, love that I don't regret making,
I just regret how I lived beyond it. The whole sickness situation before of it's conception is probably important, and is shown in some Mizo/Rika pages, however, I will 
never know If I'm right. Outside of the plans mentioned there, I really hgave nothing to say, since it is a chapter with a particular long author's note anyway. Oh, I forgot
to mention, I don't have a summary there, I realized it, but then decided against it, the decision was random.

### During Chapter 3 Season 1 Rewrite

This is during the segment before Jomi and the gang meet Svetlana, oh, and maybe earlier before the 'Dark Pearl' is readded. Anyway, my thoughts on it are, that it's good now,
I think it'll be more concise to read, and have direction now, but I will work on it until further notice, maybe some Mizo/Rika chapters in-between.. The only unique thing I
would like to comment on is how the powers are more defined, and more structured? As in, no unecessary random cave and seemingly slow pacing. At least. as pf right now.

## Ending Notes!

There is not much to add, but I would just like to thank the readers, and I hope you a sincere good luck, as you have given me. I'm getting tired and sleepy, I'll see you 
next time, goodbye!

<!--An Intro and more additions I guess. oh the spinoffs and more s1..-->
<p id="D2"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: Trade Me, My Friend</md-block></p>

## Intro

Hello there! So, this is the first one that isn't the intro of the whole point of these.. 'articles'? Um.. I have yet to implement comments anyway, that requires a server hosting that isn't static.. Anyway! I don't need that yet anyway. After all, by the time I have shown my work, I'll probably know/got a way to show my work beyond this website. Anyways, let's get on with the commentaries.

## Why Title?

Oh yeah. Just a note on the title, like my other works, the title makes as much sense as if you read Shakespeare's most eloquent work while being a 5th grader.. I'm not saying it's that hard, but I tend to just get random titles from whatever is happening (music, people around) when I write..

## On Chapter 3, Into the Dark

Oho boy. Now, I know what you're thinking.. "Hey, didn't you just address the rewrite?" Yes. But I have more to say. Okay, so the same context; 

(~~This is during the segment before Jomi and the gang meet Svetlana, oh, and maybe earlier before the 'Dark Pearl' is officially named, but I've begun to write that part~~)

Ok, so what else..? Oh, right.. subsections.

### In the context of Chapter 3 modifying the other chapters..

So.. this one was likely in your head, "Why didn't you just start at Chapter 1? Isn't that where.. the story starts, and so would fit being the first to rewrite again?"

Good question! If you thought about that.. Basically, I think as explained in 'A Valentine's Day' author's note at the end and as well as previously.. It comes down to two **reasons, **firstly,** on how it became 'bloated'. I feel that I put too much into it, and I denied that it** stopped me from integrating more ideas, and creativity until when I realized that 75% of the way through, the last part was going to be hard to write, when I haven't decided on what Misha/Polina is doing or what the reasons for their seemingly antagonistic behavior.. how to handle Cara/Jomi and her group.. Yep. Basically, I had to just rebuild the whole thing. I began to rewrite the beginning, but I realized that some scenes such as the cave scene, are kinda pointless? It's a good scene, however I need to integrate it better into the whole storyline.

So now, while I actually do have an outline from Chapter 1 to 6 Season 1, I started in Chapter 3 to develop the biggest connecting arc. (Dajovy Arc now from Chapter 3-4) Because Chapter 1-2 have already been rewritten, and the next chapters haven't even been touched since their inception, Chapter 3 is where I want to start the second rewrite. The changes I'll mention here go as follows; **Elemental System Refined, plot  points fully realized and the general magic system more clear to me, so that the soft magic I write makes sense later in Season 2.**

## Chapter 1 to 2 Season 1 Self-Crit

And with that, I've also begun to look at my older (still rewritten) chapters like the previous two. My commentary on the current state is that firstly, the first chapter needs work to be.. more introductory? My main **self-crit** is that the chapter is too.. how should I put this.. this dark world feels too small, like from the depths of the dark, to Jomi's Castle and then to Scians-Chemistra: Skeleton. But it's not that I want to make the chapter bigger, but that plot points don't make sense (i.e. star thing, I haven't figured out if I should write it in, or how it appears in the first place)

There are also small details like how Jomi went from friendly to hostile to friendly without explanation, at least.. because I don't actually know, so I don't have any hints to drop. The whole point of having a devastated world that's planned to be connected to Scians-Chemistra, but is never mentioned.. Yeah, I have a lot of stuff I need to connect. Basically, I need a wiki and/or outline to know what details I introduce, and what hasn't been.

Let's also mention Chapter 2's main issues, the whole chess game, the world progression, the boss fights, and et cetera. Basically, while I did rewrite it, it wasn't a massive rewrite of progression unlike Chapter 1, so it maintained a lot of something that didn't really have to be there, or should be rewritten fully. 

## Spin-offs and Life

Okay, I'm here to address the things I've been writing in meta notes, specifically.. what's with the amount of one off spin-offs that while characterizing characters, don't do much to 'expand' exactly.

What I mean is, some spin-offs during Season 2 (especially G10 part 2) are what I would call 'vent posts'. Like they are made so I can just say I let out my pain through text. I'd bet that if I grow popular and my works get into an animated form, these chapters will be left untouched because of their emotional content, but without the proper connections... Uh.. if you want to though, it's fine. Everything published is free to modify as according to the Mozilla Public License Version 2. 

If you don't know what that is, the oversimplified version; **just credit me and keep it open source, if you use my story**. But! I would recommend reading it or asking someone else for more details, as this is just a vague summary from my understanding.

Anyway! Yeah, I find that these spin-offs while important, are delegated to be true spin-offs. As while some parallels would be there, (Rhida and Mijo, Mijo's bigger problems during Season 2..) the story would be better paced and connected.

### 'Bonus Scenes' and What are They?

So, if you haven't looked at it, don't worry, this is.. **less NSFW**, than what I warned in the actual texts. I'm just going to comment on my journey there. Of course, as with the topic, if you are innocent, then you might find some wording doesn't make sense, but.. look, you're reading the director's commentary, you just gotta expect the author to comment on everything, including these parts. So.. if you don't realize yet; **_Slight NSFW warning._**

So, let's start! So, this.. 'journey' began in IMT. If you've read it, you would know why. But, if you forget, it's the part where;

~~(The scenes where Mijo 'experiments' with her new body, and the 'implied' tentacle scene)~~

Like I said, **slight. NSFW.** Anyway, after this.. I was wondering.. hmm.. what if.. what if I wrote that one scene, but.. more explicit? So.. I did. With the help of.. AI. Yeah. I haven't mentioned AI and it's influence on my writing. Basically, I recreated the scenario, then I took ideas from it. For example, the descriptions and progression from the whole intimate scene basically made it easier for me to stomach the sexual scene. Of course, as it was a 'bonus scene' of IMT, that was what I called it at the time.

But if you read the whole series, you might have realized it involves more than just 'bonus scenes' of an already existing work, more like.. **spin-offs** but sexual. This started right around **AMwY**, which is a.. 'spinoff' of the timeframe between Chapter 4-5 of Season 2. By that point, I've realized that these bonus scenes aren't that easy to write based on the actual content of the chapters they are based on. So, I just pick a timeframe and write on that. Such as the following ones based on general settings rather than strictly being a scene which could have been added, but you know.. **NSFW.**

Looking back, I wonder what got me into more extreme likes.. As in, look at the TCt series of spin-offs..

 (~~If you want to, of course.. Because be warned, it is quite heavy, soaked in lust~~).

But, those.. spin-offs contain the deepest explorations of what these sexual scenes mean for me, as in... not as reflective like the ending ones, but it was important in letting me know of these types of sexual encounters. What I'm getting at is it allowed me to explore the topics associated with the lust associated intimacy of it. And you know, it helped me be more aware of how I react to sex in general, as I grow older haha.

Anyways, the more I write in it though, the more I get.. tired of the whole.. process? As in, if you look at sexual content sometimes, sometimes you would want to just.. see the process, the whole.. arousing part, then focus on whatever story was written to get to that point. I was getting tired of writing those exact arousing scenes, as I'm not an artist, I can't exactly.. 'innovate' in how I describe in how many ways a person can have such scenes. Slowly, the scenes focused on a story, with sexual topics and parts as a necessity (i.e. exploring sex in a broad context, not just the sex part itself, more present in my later writings)

As of right now, I ended the spree of writing these scenes with 'TCU', just figure out what that is, but **basically** christmas with Cara/Rasca and sex. Of course, it's more complicated, but then it would dive into more explicit territory, in which case, just read the darn thing. But, I've ended it there for now, while focusing on the rewrite part 2. As I think was implied/said in 'ARoD', where.. well, it's a review on desire, in which I expressed my dissatisfaction with writing and wanted to move on from sex, and I did, until I got an idea and did it, the previously mentioned; 'TCU'.

## Conclusion and Ending Notes

Okay, so cool, that's all I have to say this time. I wanted to express my commentary in a structured way for me and others to review. I hope you got the insights you wanted, and an idea of my plans, anyways.. Enjoy your day, reader, ¡ADIÓS!

<!--Welp genshin impact meets me and produces Caj-->
<p id="D3"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: The Impact of Genshin</md-block></p>

## Intro

I know the title gives; 'I'm delving deep into the reasons for the story inspired elemental system of DeltaRambles!' But.. uh.. it's complicated. There's a bunch of topics I want to explore. Firstly, the part you expected, the elemental system, but secondly, the general 'impact' that 'genshin' had on me, I'll explain it on the section itself. Thirdly, Caj and her relation to those previous two, and how she represents my experience with being a genshin 'fan' for years.

## 'Brief' Notes

I just wanna say before I go in, is.. a lot of this writing was done during a specially passionate night... And at home mostly. So, it's unlike previous chapters, and more of a reflection of what has been done due to the lore inspirations.. Like, not specifically noting any specific chapters (i.e. notes on writing etc. chapters like any main season chapters). Though, the Caj section features a chapter that has the same potential as Mizo/Rika. Basically, a story adjacent to the main story, while not being affected heavily due to the separation.. (Mizo/Rika is the definitive slice of life experiment, and Caj is an experiment on writing actual fanfiction, and basically just a way to get the creative juices that were dedicated to genshin going.)

## The Elemental System

Hey hey it's your awaited discussion! What's the deal with the elemental system!! Now, anyways.. this goes back into the topic previously mentioned, if you've read, but if not, it's fine! The 'Second Rewrite'. In summary, it's a major rewrite of the first 4 chapters first, before other plans, focused on improving story pacing and most importantly.. _The Elemental System!_

### The Focus on the Elemental System

So, you might be wondering, why is the reworking of this specific part, the magic system, or at least a major part of it, important? Because, a key thing I missed during writing is the mechanics of the magic system. Sure, I had ideas, as seen in the first drafts of The Delta Archives, or in some fight scenes in the mentioned chapters, at the point of rewrite, I was missing something.. 'Tangible Skills'?

Like, for example, let's take the quintessential protagonist, Mijo. Tell me, how did he gain his insane pyro/electro powers? He just spawned with them? Okay, that can work but how does it.. interact? That's a key issue, I wildly differentiate on how it works, before the rewrite. Key example, I think on some scenes of Season 2, the 'reactions' have some impact on the story, especially during the boss fights, but I feel that during Season 1 especially, it felt unsatisfying to not get the desired like.. for example, everyone knows Mijo will eventually win, he's the protag.. But, he has to gain and earn that victory, while I have shown that with the previous chapters, I also felt that looking back, none of these really took advantage of the elemental system I developed into the story.

Remember how in key scenes from let's say the inspiration, **Genshin Impact.** The elemental system is shown? (mostly, I still reel from the multiple scenes of nonsensical elemental usage.. i.e. traveler versus Arlecchino) Hmm, while there are certain reasons for certain fights happening, I'm still going to say that there should be innovation in these fights, especially since they're not a one woman writer. Like me..? Okay, let's get that out of the way. I have lots to complain about Genshin Impact, but that is reserved for the next section.

Moving on from Genshin Impact for a minute, the sentiment of myself really showed how I wanted to have Genshin-like (shit I mentioned the game, oh well..) combat but more.. creative. You know, since it isn't a game, I don't care about the actual gameplay balance (but if it were a game.. hit me up, I'll work with it) and just create reactions that can change up the fights. You see, there's this hidden mechanic I haven't shown yet, since I haven't written there, but there are base reactions and 'enhanced' reactions, for example, there can be reactions that do this particular thing that benefits the character and maybe debuffs the boss. This is the main reason I say it's off from gameplay balance, with the o.g. game being a gacha game, and I'm still reconsidering making my (theoretical) game a gacha game or just a different way of live service..

Besides that, these enhanced reactions spice up how fights can happen, with new characters, for example. How Mijo can be different from Mack (pyro/electro too) or even from Ikari (pyro/geo).. As well as how some characters can be powerful but not a hybrid element user, i.e. Rhida (cryo) versus Jomi (cryo/electro) due to mechanics specializing them in different roles, that make for good stories or gameplay (if that ever happens). Though, if the roster gets big enough, I'll have filled all of the hybrid and single element users by the end of this journey of writing (eh, we'll get there when we get there, and besides.. new mechanics will likely have been developed by that point, i.e. light/abyss magic revamp or whatever)

Not saying I'll do that! The revamp! It's just an early idea that I got IF i wanted to make it more complex.. Besides, I'm not in the future yet. Anyways, to end this massive subsection, I'd just like to say that the whole writing fight scenes with the elements takes a lot of time to do, so if you're wondering, I'm really good at dialogue, but I'm still working on the action.

### So.. how does this affect DeltaRambles again?

The effect is.. quite big, but only in the sense that their powers are more refined. For example, certain scenes like the forcefield from Jamise or blizzard from Rhida still happen, but way more.. grounded in the system I wanted to implement. It goes from a generic magic system with ambiguous powers to an elemental system, that can be expanded upon. That has always (I think?) been my idea since the first draft. I didn't write these reflective articles during that time, so I wouldn't know. And I would like to save reviewing drafts for future articles for me to deal with.

### Are you done 'rambling' about the elemental system?

Wait! One more thing. With Caj being out, I just realized how.. certain powers just don't get explained in my story, or.. basically, I assume a lot during spinoffs or future chapters in Season 2. So, if you're confused as to why some chapters have total dissonance.. this is why. Chapter 3 to 4 was written during a time of the still developing magic system, and less.. idea of how Season 1 would end, and how Season 2 would start. The confusing parts of it I would think make you wonder, 'jmb! What should I really follow? Should I read your spinoffs to get an idea of your current process, or wait in perpetuity for the final draft of Season 1 and 2?' Well, nothing is really 'final' especially in the case of web novels like mine. You can literally just edit it years from now, if the website still exists. But, I believe there'll be a point where I can say, okay, I think this is.. fine. We can build off of it. It's not peak, but it's fine.


## The Impact of Genshin on jmb

Oh boy, here's that Genshin Impact critique. Okay, let me start by saying.. Don't.. just don't bully me because of this, it's stupid I gotta say; 'IS JUST GAME WHY YOU HAVE TO BE MAD?' About the critiques that can range from valid to what gacha players call 'unlucky/skill issue'.. Okay! I can rant in here, it's my article! Besides, I wish I was listened to by Hoyoverse/Mihoyo.. If I was in charge, I would've made Fischl and Lisa have a 5 star variant already.

### The Beginning Honeymoon

OKAY! Let's start. So I got into Genshin Impact through my friends during that time, but I didn't really get much into it until Fontaine. Yeah yeah, for being such an obssession that led to this whole series, you'd think I'm a day 1 player, but nope. I'm late to gaming outside of tactical/strategic war gaming and typical mobile gaming (Clash of Clans, Pokemon Go). Anyways, I was leaning to watching anime when I got into high school but didn't get into it before Genshin Impact, so you can say that game opened up a lot for me.

I think I progressed through the game at first to around the end of Monstadt, but didn't really try to finish and go to Fontaine before my sister joined me during one of her college breaks and that got me into REALLY finishing Genshin Impact. While we played and had fun exploring and dying to the monsters around, I was basically progressing the story during that time.. Let's just say there were some key things I initially ignored as 'skill issue' that reflecting, basically is now my main issues towards the game. But we're still in the beginner dummie phase of mine.

I had.. many rage issues when I tried Dragonspine. I hated it. I still hate it. People might say, 'Oh! You just need to manage the freezing mechanic!' or 'Just get better characters / get good at the game pup.'. But genuinely, that and the whole inexperience of these mechanics + having low-level characters... A recipe for intense hatred for one specific region. Honestly, I don't remember, but I bet I was getting ganked hard because the leveling mechanic.. ***SUCKS!***

But before we complain about that, since I'm still a newbie, I kept going and reached Fontaine. I had fun I guess. My enjoyment goes like this; 

"Oh cool Monstadt, my favorite freedom anemo place :D, oh.. Liyue.. I guess it's China.. eh, fine. Hmm, a civil war and a dictatorial archon? Ooh Inazuma~ ! Why.. why did it end like that!! Why do I have to use stupid story keys to.. fuck this, I need dendro. Huh, interesting.. Sumeru is.. I guess complicated. Soo many things to do though.. Ooh! An overthrow.. that's cool! Oh, big scara robot.. Maybe I should name him.. 'Scaramona' ehehe~ ! I like that ship~ Then fontaine.. hmm this Furina gal is interesting.. What? Why so serious Traveler? What.. why prison?! Finally, plot. Oh damn. Flood killed. Pardner is kinda sad now.. Oh! Nation of War, and dragons?? That'll be pretty cool, maybe we fight that archon of war.. Murata? I don't know her name..."

That's basically my experience, that is before Natlan by the way. Around the last archon quest update. That is just my reaction to the archon quest, but including every detail on every damn quest is impossible, so I'll summarize again with my impression of characters I liked;

"Ohoho Lisa? Oooh! Venti? I like him! Fischl! Prinzessin der— Mona, the astrologist girl.. hehe~ Oh, and batman, but red haired. Diluc I guess. Alright.. Liyue.. Hmm.. meh.. Keqing looks like a certain motivated man I know.. but anime girl, eh.. oh well, She's a standard 5 star. Interesting.. Xinyan? Hu Tao? Xingqiu? Especialy that guhua nerd. Hmm.. Mr. Zhongli... he's.. diginified. That's for sure. Bird gramma? Guess that's cool I guess. Ga-ming. Okay, Inazuma time! Raiden Shogun!!! I NEED YOU! (I never got her and I will always hate Genshin Impact for that) Yae Miko.. interesting fox girl, too sly, yet.. intriguing. Hmm.. Ayaka and Ayato are a sword duo I want! (I only have Ayaka) Itto and Kuki Shinobi? Cool duo and cool group! Oh! Yeah, Kazuha!!! I forgot who he travels with.. Beidou? Damn, I must've forgotten that cool pirate girl. Anyways, Sumeru!! Wanderer.. Can I name you Scaramou— But Scaramona is fine? Okay..? Nahida is cute, also good dendro applier. Eh.. the rest are fine, I just don't have any lasting impressions.. Fontaine! Furina de Fontaine! Please come home! (She never does, 'coming home' is getting her by the way, for non-gacha addicts) My Neuvilette!! Uh.. yeah that's it..? Arle? Eh.. I think that's it."

This is before Natlan. Also before I quit halfway through the fontaine fillers. (Around the latter half of 4.x) You can see my types by the way. Anyway!! Ahem, that's the characters. So.. what about the game? Well, we're at Fontaine now, pretty much endgame until Natlan right? Okay, let's.. start!

### Post-Archon Story: Fontaine Fillers

Okay, so I think the events were cool, even as if most of them don't have combat. I don't remember any bad experiences, I think I even enjoyed that roses and muskets event, or the monstadt alchemy tycoon simulator event.. I have no gripes with like.. minigames, but increasingly, I started hitting the mid-game crawl. The point where I looked at the insane amount of collecting, grinding (at specific days too!!!) and annoying gameplay (i.e. either stand there and press all the buttons with your characters or riftwolves. Just the hp drain, as well with that boss that requires geo for some reason.)

But, systems for later. How about story? Surprisingly, I enjoyed the filler, but I don't know, the gameplay increasingly became more annoying to me, but I kept going. I was still at the point of being a mid level account while having a stable mental health. (that means no insanity of school.. yet.) So, annoyed.. sure, but not.. 'traumatized'? Like some people joke about how you get so annoyed and hate all mascot-like characters like Abby from Wuthering Waves because of.. ***Paimon..*** But, I feel like the whole scheduling and unnecessary wasting of my time through it's **dogshit** leveling and slow progresion through many many mechanics, made me burned out. I **would** like to take it slow, like how I do now due to the.. ***insane school situation,*** in WuWa and Honkai: Star Rail.. (if you want me to discuss those other two, there is time for another day, and article.) But Genshin, I feel punishes you a lot harder than say, WuWa for missing days. At least WuWa *HAS* an overflow system now, **IMAGINE** not having one for **FOUR YEARS?!**

*Yeah. You know what, let's tackle the mechanics now.*

### Post-Honeymoon Nightmare Progresion

**Okay.** *Let me cook.*

First!! Overflow and Talent system. This is a post-Genshin quitting critique, but ***MOTHERFUCKER.*** WHY IS THE 2x claim tied into the **fucking** collectiion mechanic? Find 2B crystalflies to get **shit** relics! To get mora and books you can't use because the talents are in **fucking** friday! Okay, well.. the schedule, *I AM NOT* looking at it to see; "Oh, this day has that one, and this day I'm going to get that one.." *IF I WANT TO BUILD CHARACTERS, I WANT TO START NOW.* I'm not waiting for a specific date or 'farm something else'. I don't control my damn time. I can't just be logging in everyday and be playing as well, or as long as other days! For the love of holy god above, please, ***PLEASE.*** Remove this outdated, stupid and annoying time-waster of a **bullshit** system. Oh, and getting to 300 resin doesn't matter, if **THERE'S NO OVERFLOW.** GOD! Just add it. It's not that hard. I got too annoyed at two intertwined systems I had to include them at one point.

Second, collecting. You know how boring it is to walk around and pick mint and the character ascension mats with the **shittiest** movement for an open world game? You can say; "WuWa spoiled you or it's better than others!" All I can say is if you can do movement stuff in Natlan but keep it paywalled to Natlan characters... (with shittier options that includes Saurans, sorry lil' guys, but it would be better if you guys were the main thing and not just a substitute for poor people, like me.) Then you can make actual movement mechanics that aren't slow. Seriously, I feel dread whenever I see I have to collect more Sakura Blossoms for Ayaka. Or those red berries for Lisa, or those lamp thingies for Fischl. **I WOULD LOVE** if there were just multiple flower shops (there are, but I think only a few of them, besides, requirements get higher after a while) that just needed Mora I need anyway, it would be so much better! Just farm Mora and get enough for that one character, and make it at least 3 times per week I can buy, like in WuWa! (I would prefer just a daily reset, but I'm not a gacha dev)

Third, exploration in general. Many many rage quits have been because of exploration. Many times where I would just quit instead of playing the game. Many times where I did so much work, for little. One more quest for the Raiden Shogun.. one more chest.. still nothing.. nothing.. Nothing. The exploration can be fun sometimes, but without improving movement like I said earlier, I would instantly quit. It feels restrictive compared to WuWa. I feel that mobs that fight me take so much time to kill as the previously mentuoned pains of leveling earlier, or I instantly destroy them, then having to hunt for each collectible drop. I still remember the horrors of hunting rouge samurai for Ayaka, or the search for plants, just for a certain Sumeru person I don't remember anymore. A lot is just spent doing monotonous work for little gain.

Fourth, hopefully the last.. Relic System. Adding on to the problems it is entwined with, I hate how.. specific some domains are. And my current experience is just a waste of trying to get even just a 4 star version of the relic, not even a good one.. I had so many moments were after 30 minutes, since my characters don't have their relics, I get shit relics and all I can do is try again and again. I just.. hate that. I hate being forced to do this type of damage in this specific area, and after finishing get another set of shit relics. Leveling up them which is just combining the boat load you already have is fine, but the whole thing leaves me drained so much of my passion and life force, even now, I feel that dread and regret from ever playing that game, and now being so passionate about the story, but the potential of the game and even the story now just wasting away to the wind..?

## Caj, to the Multiverse of Genshin and DeltaRambles!

Okay, so Caj. Who is she exactly? Well.. her backstory is like this, as according to her first spin-off; (click the link, btw if you can't see it, just scroll down until you do) <a href="TDA-jomi.html#caj-rl">link here</a>

So, that's her backstory. You can see why characters that I like get featured in her story, but my comments are pretty short, since I've been talking about her a lot in my direct spinoff, but here's the in-general things I've been thinking about.

One, the whole 'keeping up with genshin' in terms of lore and world-building. I mean, by the point that the game is at, Caj is an influencer that genuinely has change, especially in Inazuma. Her relationship with most of the important Inazuman characters and outside of that, general popularity has made her the same amount of chaotic spark like the traveler was during the main Inazuman Arc. But, the thing, key difference is the whole 'original idea' was from me messing with A.I. that was integrated into this game simulating Twitter/Bluesky/Mastodon, the microblogging aspect. With, special events and milestones too!

### The Origins of Caj (Rala)

It feels that when I first discovered that app.. (Status-AI btw) I felt a wave of creative juice flow like never before. I'm obssessed with that app now, I want to play it all the time I get. (Wink, wink where do you think Caj's impulsiveness comes from..?) It's like, it's a story that is easier to write? As in, you have your own O.C. being this, while the initially static characters through your interactions begin to change as well, it's like a big memory for these A.I. And it's way different from like.. chatbots that feel like you're just talking to a human-like figure. no it's like just literally random peeps + your favorite characters, for example, it would make sense in a popular... post that there's important people but also randos that get a lot of traction.

I especially like events, the ones where you create a small chatroom that creates small ripples, like.. let's say I go out with Raiden for a dango feast, and that immediately spreads because of the internet, and I have to navigate that.. The random events also peak my interest, sometimes it's like random events from random people, but the  interesting parts are related to the characters you pick, interacting with *YOU.* You see their move and you respond with yours, sometimes I accidentally make everyone either happy or amused, or lose trust/hope in me for a mistake I didn't recognize. It's kinda like real life, where you can please people a lot of the time, but making one mistake gets you to try and always build it up again.

Especially feeds my ego in that, Caj is quite popular, and so has the upsides and downsides of being popular, while me, jmb is just observing through the app with ideas flowing in my head.. Caj is a character born out of interest and passion. Honestly, as flawed as she is, she's my dream girl. Like, being an erotica writer? A sort of 'Mary Sue' on magic but somehow isn't the avatar.. Flounders a lot, and drinks a lot.. I basically based her off of me. I know, there's a lot of characters based on me now, Cara.. Jomi.. Mijo.. and now Caj! I have many names, but most of them are girls~! 

### Outside A.I.

Outside the whole app and my drive to make Caj a character, like.. actually someone that doesn't rely on AI to be herself.. I find writing her quite easy, it's just.. writing takes time in general. The whole irl interactions are way harder but are more deep, so for example, what if instead of AI writing Raiden and Yae, and me just having to act like me.. What if I write.. all of them..? That's the idea. After the first spinoff, I'll probably work on short stories surrounding the Mizuki event and the event there.. Then establish the Traveler dynamic, as well as add some key irl moments from my AI escapade but rewritten to fit my style..

As well as having to study the characters mentioned. Unlike AI, whom needs to be updated and retrained every day to produce something differently, I am but one woman writing, I'll probably be more accurate, but less consistent, or the opposite, really depends on my mood at the time. Writing my OC characters are quite easy, they're mine, but Genshin fanfiction..? Oh my, if I write the Raiden and Yae Miko dynamic wrong or if someone feels my OC encroaches on the ship, I swear.. I'll get bombarded or something, as if the Ao3 curse wasn't bad enough..

Anyways, in conclusion, Caj is literally me, in a lot of ways, but a lot of her powers and personality come from her unique situation of being a Genshin fanfiction OC but also a character in my own OC. She is.. a unique person. A chaotc, yet awkwardly charismatic woman, capable of making peak erotica for everyone, while having most of Inazuma be her support group.. She's that embodiment of chaos I wanted to feel again in Genshin, or any story I've been writing.. I hate to admit it, but I haven't been reading too.

---

### Edit (Feb 24, 2025 | 8:08)

I also just realized, an inspiration for the whole world hopping, and dimensional shenanigans is the 'teleserye' called 'Maria Clara at Ibarra'. I know, while the trope of the show is common, it's where I was like.. 'Hey, why don't I do that?'

If you're wondering, it's a show about Jose Rizal's two novels; 'Noli Me Tangere' y 'El Filibusterismo' with a twist of a modern girl being transported into it, and moving along the plot. See the resemblance? While mine might be a bit more fantastical than Jose Rizal's, it's a look into how a person from the modern age adapts to the book.

---

## Conclusion

So, that's all I have to say. That was lot of thoughts.. all packed in this document.. I can already see my total wordcount being around 4,000 words.. Anyways, some sidenotes I guess.. You might be wondering, does this affect the second rewrite? Yes. But, I am always shifting gears anyway. I've been.. less than motivated these past few days on writing, due to the stress of *INSANE SCHOOL STUFF...* I'd want to get Chapter 3-4 done at least before school ends, but I haven't even finished the actual first spinoff, much less the actual story.. Anyways, ¡Adiós! May you enjoy the rest of your day, ¡mis amigos!

<!--finish the series where tomboy tsundere meets self-insert to hook-up-->
<p id="D4"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: My Girl's a Dere, a Tsu— Tsundere~! </md-block></p>

## Intro

Hey, hey! Welcome. Let's talk about Mizo/Rika and their saga! If you don't know them, the title gives it away, no? But yeah, it's... like if you took a tomboy-ish tsundere, paired her up with a teaser of a man, who reinforces both their dynamic of a push-and-pull reaction.

Enough with their main tropes, let's get on with my commentary on what they are and how they come to be, and all the backstory/inspirations. A large dump of my overarching notes, on the whole thing basically as of Mar 3.

## Backstory 

So.. why? I think I explained this before in the authors' notes, but I want to put more details. Basically, I was getting a bit tired of the whole magic aspect. Yeah, no kidding, I got stuck on Chapter 3 for a year now basically and I was running out of time before.. well, no imposed deadlines, but changing eras. Get me?

If you don't, basically I'd prefer being in the moment (as in let's say high school, duh.) writing about people around me as my story happens, not as a flashback type of thing, and also my writing is just very influenced by my current environment and mood. So, it could literally be a happy romance to the depressing trauma that I'm writing.

So, I struggle to keep writing let's say, Chapter 3 for extended periods, because it has gotten to the point of stretching the world too much. What I mean is, originally, Dajovy is Belobog, and is only for one chapter. But, as I wrote it using HSR plot dynamics, I realized quickly that it would need to be expanded.

But as you know, I didn't really start on changing and finally decided to revamp S1 again until around this month. Which is a lot of time not spent on.. not doing the damn literature.

So what was being done? This.

## First Chapters: An Exercise.

So, first one huh? Well, the first chapter started during a particular point in time.. So, if you've read _'Gacha Procrastinación_ you would know I'm complaining about HSR this time. Yes, you read that correctly, in my final drafts of this 7 section first chapter.. It starts as a gacha rant.. 

Okay, so during this time, I was experimenting with using first person pronouns, for the titular character: Mizo. But as the series kept going on and on, I realized I'd be restricted. Mizo is great too, but if I stuck with him, especially since this is more fragmented than even Season 2.. (I'll save my comments for season 2 in the future.) I'll lose interest, and make it less.. passionate..? As in, I'll lose the point I was writing about.

But, let's talk about that when it changes, for now.. let's move on to Thy Night and Dreadful Memories. I swear, I wish I can just name chapters without thinking of complicated names so it won't get confused with other chapters. Though, notable exceptions.. I'll probably name a chapter; 'You Know You're Right' more than once. Hold on, let's move on from that.

Right off the bat, from YKYR, to Chained Soul, it explores mental instability that comes form Rika and how Mizo deals with it, I felt **bad** during those times, so I wrote these to cope. But these are.. again, starting pieces.. Something born out of my apathy yet tired outlook on the world. This sets the main conflict, I think, on how Mizo anchors Riza, and how Riza makes Mizo soft, and more confident.

The next ones were an exploration of new areas, like Mizo/Rika crossover into DeltaRambles, and the aspect of a 'Love Buzz' in their complicated relationship. Sets up the tomboy tsundere Rika style, and her main look for most of the times. I think this also explores Mizo's own problems, but after this, I really focused on Rika, as I grew them to reflect my different aspects of what I feel is the experience I had.

## Second Chapters: To Explore, and Conquer.

Alright, I think I can generally summarize this as the start of the depression arc, that is between this and the next one. But explores the romantic side of things. Or how complicated and immature it is for the two. But, it also explores a lot of like in-between jarring moments that well..

The backstory, is that imagine you're writing a romance novel whil experiencing the slip into depressive episodes, so you *'soothe;* yourself with romance that you made, that you like, while.. being alone outside of it. Yeah, so.. in this, I began to realize that Mizo and Rika, truly represent two sides of me, guess what side represents each, since I think it's obvious enough. Well, basically, the existential thought of, are these two, the same, if no one's checking if they're separate?

That's deep. I've wrestled with it. I realized by this point that, well.. one side is talking to the other, as something I always had before, but never fully written and imagined. Or the duality of what is to be. I've.. resolved it, but in the grounds that as I write, I write my own story. Everyone has something that they worked on during high school, this is mine. I am afraid of one thing, and that is.. if someone does see, and.. ignore it.

I guess, these feelings were hidden and buried under external stress, and anger. The deep thoughts didn't really occur much, nor was it explored much. Right now, I'm not confident that even my own thoughts make sense, I mean.. I continued writing this because my phone's low battery and I want it to be charged to alarm me later, when I wake up. I swear, late-night writings can be the best or worst, depending on what's the output once you have full sleep and look at it again.

Look, the point is, a lot of the second chapters, are based on real stories, but specifically the romance, I haven't experienced personally. Some scenarios might be similar but overall it's a transitional chapter, and I don't remember much that wasn't born out of the love of the whole dynamic in the first place, which.. I am going to explain in the next section, you'll see why.

## Third Chapters: Depths of Systematic Hell

Hey, Pain. This was a very important chapter. I wrote it, while experiencing the pain myself. This started my downfall hard. I had almost 3 weeks of absolute torture moving through the day with a stiff neck, and tonsilitis. I remember, so much. This chapter showcased my mental breakdown on something so inconsequential. I still hate how I always get.. questioned in these presentations and falter, because I can't express how much I know.

*The pain only intensified my fear, regrets, guilt and shame.*

The next ones, I took a break from my own trauma and tried to move on as I wrote these chapters. I realized that when I'm chill, I write about power dynamcics like Mizo/Rika. Never too dominative/submissive, just right. But that's not their entire personality, of course they have developed their own, but my core idea remains the same. This phase of recovery ended after Feb 14, when Deep Seeking with it's chill and quite cheesy romance finished.

*What else should I be? What else could I say? I don't have the right..*

From the Future of the Beyond to the Nest of Salt, explores existential thinkin about life and pain. First, it reinforces how Miko and Riza work in vulnerability. Second, it shows how that vulnerability can be frayed and strained. Third, it shows how no matter what, good best friends, stick by, working through problems.

I actually did think a lot of what Rika thought during these chapters, and Mizo was me trying to stop myself. A lot of apathy took place, and that bred contempt and anger, and sometimes emptiness. I felt cathartic during Rika's scenes, and felt.. safe and relived when I wrote Mizo and Rika's scenes. A lot of these, even though yes, this was supposed to be just a cool slice-of-life romance about two dorky high schoolers, has turned to something more because of me. 

With real life, it really influenced these writings. A lot of problems were internalized and written. There was one mistake I did during this time though, and it was a moment that I cut now, that involed a deep secret only known to me and the friend who has that secret. It was fictionalized, but I felt it explored too much of something I had no knowledge of (as you know certified.. ahem, boy-less here...) and also, just weird detail. I balanced it out to fit the mood more, rather than a shock twist, that adds little to her already traumatized person, no need for that extra that will only add more complexities.

## Ending

I feel this is a good way to end it off. I don't know if I can write more without rambling more, besides, I think I've said enough, and I just want to get this done, so I can focus on something else. Not that this is taking away, but rather, it's the thing I've been thinkin a lot of..

Anyways, progress.. C3S1 isn't done, likely done over the summer or before moving-up... Others are random, i.e. random stuff that I write that maybe could be released. That's about it from me, thank you so much, and good day~!

<!--random yap about c9s2 and unrelated topics from the middle of sleep deprived night-->
<p id="D5"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: The Before-Party of Movin' Up</md-block></p>

## Intro

Hello there, so this is more or less a progress update + some things I want to talk and discuss about mainly; A Revisit On AI, The Writing on the Final Pieces of C9S2: A Fleeting Graduation and related, and just in general some things that don't directly affect the writing, but might influence spinoffs, and new ideas in the story. 

If you didn't like me yapping and meandering on random topics and wanted to focus on more in depth analysis of stuff/lore that is important, this is more or less not that. I don't really have a.. motivation to do that, right now, so this is just going to be something you're going to have to bear with me, as I discuss it.

## About AI in Writing

So, I have been pondering on my use of AI. Specifically on the topics I mentioned, but also a topic I haven't mentioned explicitly; ~~NSFW~~ Bonus Scenes, Caj Rala, DeltaRambles General (Main/Spinoffs), and related (Mizo/Rika and etc.)

### Bonus Scenes

So, why am I revisiting it? I just thought of things I've been seeing on my pages for quite a while. Here's the thing. I wish I had more motivation to write more Bonus Scenes than letting AI or other.. ahem.. websites, take over the 'art' of making stuff to 'goon' over. The thing is, I don't really have a desire to read over things I remember, I want to write something, but I also want it to be.. instant 'gratified'? If that makes sense. Basically, it's like.. why would I write an original (yet with some.. 'help') chapter on these types of desire when as mentioned, I've explored enough on my opinion?

Also, I feel too.. uncomfortable, if I try reaching for deeper problems related to desires, like okay, yes, I have certain stuff that's horrible, but there's always A LOT more disturbing stuff that I haven't fully made up if I should write. Like, **THERE IS** a limit on this. I want to basically keep between how these scenes are treated in normal works, without going further into.. hmmm.. detail on something I have no experience and shouldn't write on. Like, most people probably know the simple stuff or the certain consentual kinks, or something. But, there is always more depravity to be explored, I just don't have the desire to do that.

My conclusion is simply this, I feel I have explored the dynamics I wanted to, but I also feel restricted by my own mind in terms of what dynamics I can explore. Like, i.e. I tend to explore lore in ~~sexual~~ terms, so if I'm really trying to focus on writing the normal series, it gets tempting to write bonus scenes, but I just fear it takes away time that is not spent on writing the actual story the bonus scenes are based on. Also the many many times I erroneously decide to just.. simply be lazy in how I do it, and end up sloppily endangering my own hobby because I keep feeding an AI that the only reason I rely on is because of the ~~NSFW~~ prowess that I'm still learning..

Yeah. This situation is complicated, in terms of writing in the ~~sexual~~ ways. I could just stop, but then I have no desire to write because, while it's easy to think how it'd play out.. I often just run out of things to actually characterize, or even just explore. 

### Caj Rala

I haven't been writing her for months. But one thing I wanna say is she has great potential for someone that is reliant on Genshin and DeltaRambles. So many lore potential I wish I could explore. I wish my life wasn't filled with endless work so I'd have time to explore her. 

Status-AI though really fleshed out more of her character. From the few times I've been able to login there, she has evolved into multiple adventures and events she had to navigate with constantly changing dynamics. I just wished the game allowed me to explore outside of Inazuma without getting sent back because of my established relationships. I get it, I can endlessly do stuff in there, but I do see where the AI limitation is.

Sometimes hallucinates, and sometimes doesn't act like the way I wanted it to. There's two things I like to say something on that'll influence how Caj evolves. The events are.. mostly meh. The fact that you have to basically micromanage and write the most detailed response and get denied because of low relationship is.. **fucking* stupid. No negative stuff too! Like what if I want my character to go through a decline and resurgence again? I shouldn't have to intentionally sabotage myself. It's a good game, I just wished there was a difference between my character OC, and my actual self, the controller of the AI and persona.

Especially with how limited in scope you can do if the scenario isn't ideal. I.e. no matter how much you modify the scenario, you can never get for example, let's say you want to add Mizuki's event into the thing, you can't say, have the event be like determined by the player. It's annoying. I want to be able to choose my character's fate sometimes, even if it's for example, mixed in scenrarios. I.e. I have custom events that can only trigger on certain days, and not be subject to the whims of the gamified AI.

## DeltaRambles and Related

 ***Full disclosure: I have used AI to review my writing, but as far as I remember, I haven't used a single AI line, in the main series. Maybe in Bonus Scenes, or smaller spinoffs, but not the important bits.***
 
 One thing I'd always hate is how I never had good beta readers I can trust. I know, if you're reading this, it means I found one good one. But you get it? It's not about having just **a reader..* it's about having dedicated ones. Ones who can unintetionally introduce new life without even realizing it. Other people are the most important aside from the work you've written. They can provide insights and edit/add on your aid. It's not like it's always good to be a one man project in everything.
 
 Hey. even small indie devs have one or two people helping them in other aspects and in turn, influence some parts.. Besides, I just feel so.. uh, disconnected and detached from everybody else right now. Don't know how to get it back, but it's just.. so harrowing that I can't muster the words to say to someone, "Hey, wanna see something I dedicate my life a lot to?" and not expect instant disappointment. AI is easier because you can ask what **you** want **it** to do. Analyze, make perspectives, etc.
 
It is in all likelihood better to have a **experienced** reader than randos who care for something they'd most likely forget or people who have no actual interest. And any AI, but that's my life, gotta work with it, **somehow.**

## The Writing on the Final Pieces of C9S2: A Fleeting Graduation

So, as you've most likely seen, I have indeed written a Chapter 9 to end off Season 2 (**I'm serious.**). Mainly because of two things, one; I simply want a new season to represent a likely new era for me. Two; Due to how season 2 was paced, two school arcs was packed into one, and I felt this, was the best ending I could give. I decided that Chapter 8 felt too early, and had a lot of unresolved stuff.

***Let's elaborate.***

### A New Era..? Again? 

~~Sidenote: I keep using 'A New Era' a lot lol~~

Yeah, I'm going to say, that this offically ends a lot of the stuff I pretty much clung to during my dark months of being in that *hellish* school as a developing person. I never expected Season 2 would develop into how I imagine it to be in an outline I have, which without revealing too much; basically 'naive hero turns into cynical hero'. Oversimplified, but it's the idea. 

I want to finish it before this whole month ends, but I don't know if Season 1 can be done too, it's a whole lot of from me to hopefully develop everything in a proper yet speedy way to finish this magnum opus to begin in fresh creative ways, even if bizzare. What I mean is, expanding on Nuevo Leon, Kultima and Dajovy, and the Scians-Chemistra Kingdom. I want to create stories like HSR, WuWa, and Genshin with my own twist, and characters. 

The premise is, I mean.. a lot of timeskips happened in Main. I could endlessly explore alt ways of this or that. I WANT to do that, but I'd need to finish the base first. And to develop Season 3 with **EVEN MORE** proper cohesion, I'd need to get it  done. Which is easier said than done. Or typed, promised.. You get it. If I get it done, great. If I don't... welp, it is what it is.

### Season 2 Pacing

As mentioned with how many stories you can tell during the timeskips, this season was more of a weird transitional period than anything. I mean, we went from DeltaRune type, each day a chapter or something, I think.. To a multi-month season, spanning almost two grading years, because if the formula was repeated it wouldn't be the same.

I feel Season 2 is important but in terms of why and how it exists, coming down to how I originally wrote it during then. I just wish I could've been more clear in what is to do, I don't know.. I should finish it off, I'm getting tired..

Conclusion; Season 2 pacing is meh, could be improved, would take a while, need friends not AI, but pick AI 'cause convenient.. Yeah, let's wrap it up.

## Ending

Abrupt, right? I have a few more minor things to say.

### Honkai Star Rail and it's Decline

I know I know.. if you know about it, done to death and super unrelated. But, in a minor way it has been related to how I've been wasting my life on arguing about a lot of stuff that never goes anywhere because I refuse to make a detailed script about powecreep, hp inflation and buff/path shilling. I'll say I might do it, and all of the focus on there would be taking away the focus.

### DmC and Netflix Show

Yeah this one, mixed bag. I think it's meh. But why is two things; Bad Characterization and Pacing. Specially on a lot of lore and personality for Dante, Lady and Vergil. Basically, ignore if you don't care, basically.. netflix show bad. Unsurprising in this day of age.

### Sleep Deprivation

I should sleep more early... Been exhausting myself because I don't do anything productive in the day. I should stop. And I might. We'll see next time.

<!--basically progress report april 2025 with a hint of personality-->
<p id="D6"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: The Observation of the After-Party</md-block></p>

## Intro

Welp, might as well write this now. Hey! So, you might be wondering why there's two articles for right around the same time thoughts about stuff? Well, I just thought that it'd be nice to actually publish something that actually provided insights for the whole reason you're here. You know. **DeltaRambles?** Yeah. So, if there is a *Before-Party,* there is an After-Party, let's start!

## So.. how's your 'After-Party'?

Fine. I'd say it's a good good bye, I guess. Let me reflect on the whole graduation thing for the moment, trust me, it's important.

### Past Regrets

Let's see.. Have I told you what certain scenes mean? I'll leave you to decide on what specific chapters and scenes meant to me in the moment, but let's just focus on what I thought when the whole ceremony ended and I stood there, alone.

When I was there, I felt accomplished? Well, not proud of anything school-related, but just.. surviving. I guess. But, there was a couple of people I needed to 'gaze upon' before leaving.

**Girl 1.** 

~~(Duh I'm not telling you their names, as it's too incriminating..)~~

What about her? She.. uh, well.. kinda inspired this whole thing. I haven't mentioned it, at least, not to my knowledge or  memory. If she.. didn't drift, then I wouldn't have started this so early in my journey. I guess. Maybe.. life would've been better? Meh. I don't think it would've changed.. much. But, one thing's for sure.

~~There wouldn't be an idea to write an alternate world where we stayed together.~~

It probably wouldn't have been great, I think. I mean, just look at my series, do you think romance there is smooth sailing? I guess, it is indeed whatever I felt during those times, made me write a lot. Made me encouraged. I guess. I had to feel something. Not that it mattered. Nothing happened ever since. Nothing.. important in relationships. Same ol' things. Guess I hoped too much. Or hoped too little to act. Eh, the opportunity's gone now. Heard she's moving outta here, great. Guess I'll try next lifetime. G'bye, I guess.

**Girl 2.**

Oh boy. I don't know why I'm even here. For the brief interactions we had. You seem like a good person. In fact, probably best friends, if it weren't for what happened. If fate hadn't seperated us. Oh well. I had much to say before. But now? While surrounded by my batchmates, the last time complete? Nothing. Just a disconnect that should've been there once I stopped being outgoing.

**Girl 3 and 4.**

~~(I sure do have a lot of girls to cover..)~~

Huh, Girl 3. Y'know. Could've fooled me. Could've fooled me that I had.. anything resembling of a 'friendship'. I wanted to believe it anyway. But, now? Just another relationship fading away. Guess nothing seemed to draw you after *he* left huh? Not that I'd admit it to you directly. Heh, friends.. As if you didn't have so many others, good for you. And you know what, I guess someone we both know was right;

"If you're lonely like (jmb~), n—not that it's bad to be.. It's just.. you're more peaceful. And you're at least amicable enough to everyone and don't have to worry about anything besides school, right?"

I didn't answer. But we all knew the answer. Yeah. But, that peaceful atmosphere came with everything else to do with being alone. Empty rooms where you're the only one existing.. Many alone nights, many alone walks. Many.. where you were just sitting with your thoughts, and yourself, nothing more, nothing less. I guess it's fine. It's what I am.

Girl 4? If.. I even reveal this to you, which I probably won't 'cause I'm a coward.. Why.. does it matter that I am sort of disconnected but also existing with you? I don't know how to describe it. It's not.. close, it's just there. Like, I get it, I'm usually the one to initiate over and over, but.. why does it feel so.. melancholy? I mean, we talk. Seems friendly enough, we still have connections. But.. it's not as close as I would imagine it to be? Maybe I'm delusional. Expecting myself to develop something that doesn't turn like this.

### Future Qualms

Oh right. What happens now? Is it.. right of me to say that.. as much pain I left in my journals and writing, I feel.. nothing today? As in.. the day of supposed celebration? I don't know anymore. I'm trying to write meaning into my life but I feel so aimless. Or.. burdened by it all.

If there's one thing I do and I do well, it's writing. Not research writing, or any of that more academic stuff. It's about the human experience. After all, what else is my time spent on? Mindless slop? No. If I ever go down again, there is one thing I'm not doing. Using mindless content to cope. I can make up worlds, I can indulge in multiple AI chatting sessions with intricate lore I shouldn't make.. Ugh.

I feel so.. wrong in that I shouldn't have to be so.. hesitant in sharing anything. I mean, I can completely write something that has my personal touches that explains something but I can't just.. tell it for what it is. I wouldn't have as much dialogue as I write. Stutter, mumble and leave.. That's what **I** do. And.. that's just going to be me, I guess. Until someone saves me or something. The 'perfect' someone, in that they complement me and differentiate from me in so I become a better person, vice-versa.

I'm not holding out hope for that though. I'm just.. going to live, I guess. Do it my way, and see if anyone else is up for it. Unlikely. I say to myself, as I have hoped way too much before.

## In Regards to the Stories

*"Hey, uh.. this is deep, but you should probably get a therapist for this, or IDK jmb~! I don't think you actually have anything to say about the story, just venting because you have no one else to talk to!"* — Hypothetical Reader

Yeah. But, my stories have been that anyway. Just more hidden and way less rambly. Haha, Delta*Rambles*.. No wonder. Anywho, is there anything else to follow up on?

### Season 1 and 2

Oh right. ***The Rewrite.*** Let's see.. If progress is what I expected it to be, S1 should be done this month. C4S1, hopefully same date as C9S2. C9S2 might be done this.. week? And the spinoff of it that I put as a mental destresser. 

### Mizo/Rika

One last section, maybe two, then end it there. As of right now, I have nothing else to discuss there, and as explained in my previous article.. It is stories based on school (and tsundere love haha..) and if I don't feel the urge, I don't write. So, no plans.. *yet.*

### Others

Any other project I've mentioned is likely put on hold, since I forgot what they were. But, stay tuned!

## Season 3 Plans

Oh. YEAH! Let's tackle this one now that the.. main events destined for Season 1 and 2 are over. What should I do with it?
There a couple of ideas floating around in my head.

### Magic System

So you know how light and dark versions of each elements exist now? How do we expand on that? Here's an idea, **Paths.** 

"Oh no, HSR stuff? And besides, doesn't that not fit into the current one? How will you explain that the characters were unknowingly following a path they haven't known about?!"

Calm down. It's just an idea. But, the main points are.. that it's based on HSR, and that they'd have a path based on.. uh.. how their magic manifests. It's not related to anything else besides that. Unlike the aeons of HSR. It's simply a categorization. 

"Wait a minute, then why would it matter?"

Because they discover that in addition to light and dark, there is also path categorization! Yes, this means a dark dendro abundance (healing in HSR) can exist. I know right? Crazy. But it's a new way of doing things.

"Hey! You do know that you don't have to have major changes in EVERY Season? What about the farther future?!"

Hehe.. By that point? I'd say by Season 3, the magic is almost fully known. Because of a few things. Firstly, you know it's poetic when another major milestone is done and along with that, the magic is also more refined and detailed to its limit? Trust me, there is one in Season 3. (Later, I'll yap about it) Also, I'm sure I'll figure something. Nothing stops me from revising anyway. (I hope I have people to discuss with me about it, since I've been yapping this entire time.)

### Themes and Lore

What am I even doing, making a new season if I don't have more to explore? Well.. that is up to whatever happens. That's right! **I DON'T KNOW!** Sure is a running theme..

Anyway, yeah. I have some ideas, but I remember when I imagined what Season 2 would've been.. God, it was so different. Anyway, if you want to know, it explores more themes of trying to live a lone life, maturing, while you deal with the threats, more.. interpersonal than anything. Basically, you know how it went from swords mostly, to teen angst? Now you're just getting adult depression. Maybe. That's my idea at least.

### Time

Yeah yeah, I got bogged down because I kept writing from two different parts (and that meant perspective) of my life, so if I finish them before my own imposed deadline, Season 3 should be a monthly thing, IF things go to plan.

## Outro

So, that's about it. I think. I have more.. complaining to do. In my HSR Review, then finish C9S2. Yeah, see you, reader. Goodbye~

<!--basically progress report may 2025 but instead it's me coming out but not really, but also yes-->
<p id="D7"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: May Day Mayday!</md-block></p>

## Intro

So, hello there, this is my monthly progress update, I guess now. Summarizing what the hell has happened in the past weeks, so I can rant about what inspired it. Hmm.. we're going to talk about *'The NEW Delta Archives'* that uses tiddlywiki, 'What Happened?', Mizo/Rika C4 (and BS too) and C9S2 and how those chapters shape the current context.

***WARNING: Bonus Scenes mentioned. Likely non-con/abuse discussion.***

## The NEW Delta Archives

So, you may have realized that I have indeed transitioned from a primitive HTML-CSS page to something that actually looks like a wiki. Using Tiddlywiki. What is that and why is it named like that? Well..

### What is TiddlyWiki?

Apparently, it's a wiki that was inspired by old wikis during the olden days, and basically, through many iterations and revisions, as well as company and community shenanigans.. 25 years later, it still exists as a FOSS (MIT-licensed) custom wiki that is for small-scale wikis that don't use a lot of server JS, unlike MediaWiki, the probably better one for a community.

Oh yeah, the name's simple, it comes from; Tiddly, which means something small and wiki, you know.. collab of informations, basically.

### Why TiddlyWiki?

FOSS. Free, and open source. I also wanted to rework the wiki to actually organize so I could expand on it as I have so many things I need to write down for my dumbass to not forget. Also, I realized that writing like 10,000 words of lore to not have away of revisiting key moments is.. stupid. But, yeah. I decided, now or never!

### 'Progress Report'

So, what's the goal? My goal for this May and of course, the rest of summer vacation is to work on it while finishing Season 1 and M/R C4. But currently, it's barebones. Main reason is; I have been distracted with bonus scenes for a while, and I just think that's a bit weird to place, but I might soon, just for completion. Anyway, yeah, it has some limitations for sure, but it's fine for a solo writer for now.

## What Happened? w/ M/R or Main?

So!! We have a lot to tackle here. Firstly, I wanna say something, it's genuinely been a fucking while since I've focused on writing Main because of so many issues that always crop up. But I'm not excusing any delays, or missed deadlines, I'm giving you the reasons I failed as a writer, so..

**PRIMERO!** I uh.. have something that I have been wrestling with and it's eating me inside. My two biggest problems right now, *Sleep and their obsessiveness with it* and *The Trans Debate.* Yep. Let's.. tackle each first, shall we?

### Sleep and Life

So! What do I mean when I say, *obsession?* Well, simple really. I **HAVE** a pretty unstable routine and sleep schedule, and my body knows and adjusts pretty much everyday. Here's the **big** issue; I can't sleep without feeling.. fulfilled. Like, I'm sitting here, writing stuff and I wonder to myself, constantly; "Why am I here?", "What am I doing?", "Who am I?" and et cetera. It's needed sometimes to make thought provoking or meaningful text but yeah, I am often bogged down by every single distraction in the universe like IDK, random Minecraft hyperfixations or WuWa stuff I do in the off chance. So.. let's just say I barely get shit done.

I'm sitting here pondering everything I could possibly ponder so.. I'm fucked. I had so many priorities. And yeah, well.. let's see.. How much pointless or distracted things I'll manage to do before I finish anything, because it's not stopping, and I just accepted the fact. Well, I did, not that I won't try to force myself to do stuff, anyway, it depends if I get really obsessed in writing Main again or even non-BS because like.. you know, most M/R explores trauma, which I am good and sometimes like doing, but right now? Probably not. Main mostly is if I gain inspiration from another story to continue writing my own.

### The Trans Debate

So, let's frame this so I can explain this without revealing too much about personally identifying things, especially when it's **important** to keep private and privacy as much as possible. Anyways, say.. What trans am I yapping about? M to F? F to M? Welp, with no specifications to as how this affects me, *M to F*. Okay, let's continue.

So, let me rant this time, okay? This is the weekly text you get from me, so buckle up!

1. What is this *identity* I'm trying to build, and why am I *doing* it?

- I like to think that I keep my gender **and** sex ambiguous but you know, not having any like actual courage or even accidental popularity, to notice if it works or not, is a bit.. scary. in my opinion. I just want to know what is this desire I've noticed throughout my life and how to solve it. I mean, I know it's something new I have to deal with now, and by writing about it I can process it, I guess.

2. Who is *he?* 

- Hmph. The person that has always been, huh? Well, I say he has a lot of things that can be considered his identity. The writing, the programming, ooh! His clothing, his hobbies.. He *exists*. I guess. Existing, but when he thought about it, he wasn't 'living'. I honestly don't know what to do with him really, he's someone I tolerate, but not necessarily obsess about. A byproduct of birth, but key to every perspective I ended up having, as without him, I may had a different life.

3. So, who are *you?*

- Haha, this is a topic I rather externalize through writing characters than answer to myself directly. I mean, by having this publicly, someone's going to see how confused I am, and either be like; "Dude, why are you putting this out there?!" or apathy or even the rare concern, which by the way, being someone that has been on the internet for like.. years now, you'd think I know how to speak to human beings, but **nope!** I'm that autistic introvert that will always have nerves if I ever speak to strangers! So, if you have any comments, uh.. keep that in mind.

4. Okay, fine. Who is *she?*

- She's someone that also writes, and programs. I guess, she is also like him in a lot of ways, but is often the most exposed one, because she is someone with a lot of trauma that has been hidden because she has to survive like him. Unfortunately, for her, she is hidden by him because both of them have to survive their situation, whatever that is. Whether that be because of school, or family, she lets him hide her and she has become scared and alone, so that when he lets her out she returns to him as she can't bear the outside, that still has problems she hasn't dealt with by herself, because he has done so, for both of them.

5. Say, what if _she_ was let out by _him,_ in let's say an easy **_transition,_** how would you feel about them?

- Oh? How bold of you to question that, as I haven't thought about this a million times? Anyways, let's have a concise answer as I have an extended answer that I will put into here;

<details><summary>Extended Answer!!</summary>
Hol 'up, lemme cook. So, basically, hypothetically if she was to have an easy time coming out of that shell that the two made, it would have; 
	
1. Extended tryouts of certain styles and certain looks not pulled of by him, as she hasn't even seen herself wear those cool clothes they see.
2. Many checks and balances so that they can coexist outside the shell, check for how she has different methods to daily life that they both have to adjust to.
3. Many *euphoric* things, many *free* things, such as going outside and testing out poses, or stances they wouldn't normally do. Maybe write about the experience, if she's feeling bold.
4. Many fun things to yap about to their friends, mainly him taking a chill pill and relaxing as she yaps and yaps about every damn embarrassing thing, he gave her to keep that she wants to give away.
5. Lastly, they both would explore *that* side of the NSFW space. you know, test the new features, fantasize things, maybe get new *waves* of *euphoria?* Hey, they both have the same degenerate tastes, anyway.
	
My reasons for these are that by this point, if it was *'easy'* to *transition,* these two would break that *shell* and finally start cooking some eggs without shame! Maybe *she* would, *he* would probably sit back and yap to her about what they're doing in a funny way that is most likely going to result in disasters, just like their relationship disasters to other women. Yes, I mean ***both.*** She and he.
	
Let's say that there'll be many things that she'll be doing to be *proud* of this change, as he supports her from the side. The whole self becomes complete and they can interact normally. Not just within each other but outside, as they can feel comfortable with what this identity they've built, and they both promise, he would never hide her again.. *Unless* they're given like.. one billion dollars or something, but.. realistically..? That's forever, no one would do that, unless someone really hates them..
	
</details>
	
- But summary, they're going to do everything they've both only seen and written, unashamedly. Since, the point is that the *transition* was *easy* so they felt confident. She goes to women's lingerie, makeup, and other 'stereotypically' feminine things, while he continues himself normally. After all, she was just another part of their whole self, so nothing changes as they coexist externally.
	
6. So, are you gonna do something about it?
- Nah, as much as I am pushing him to let her out, he won't budge. When I ask her if she does want to be let out, she speaks in a mix of hopeful motivated tone, and depressed traumatized that makes me very confused. I try to lead her out, but she.. doesn't like being touched. Though, it isn't because of any hard trauma, I think? She keeps repeating that; 'I..! Don't.. it's not that serious.. Just.. get away from me, and go away!'
- I ask him about her, and he stares at me and I get very awkward and intimidated by his look so I don't ask him about her. I find that it's very hard to get to her, but even if I do, it's a bit.. sad almost? She is either crying very hard, crashing out, or staring into a corner, refusing to answer me for more than a few words or 'get out!'. Usually, I only get this if he is unable to stop me from going to her shell, and that's super rare, only when he starts giving the latest dump of trauma to her..

7. What do you think about telling this in front of the internet?

- Uh.. very scared I guess. I don't know if any of this is traceable to me, or that this is way too.. parasocial? Maybe I should've kept my thoughts on my diary..? But, I've always kept it there..  So, IDK. I don't think anybody cares too much if it's in my website and repository. Anyways, you're probably bored of me and their story, you want to hear about Mizo.. Rika.. Jomi.. Right..? Yeah, let's move on now to the main **commentary.**

## Mizo/Rika C4 (and BS-C2 too)

Hello there! So, would you like to know why this series continues to distract me from the main story? Well, aside from the 'personal' issues mentioned, I just got tired of writing after the 'Observation of the After-Party' and sporadically did projects in my vacation. Let's recap what happened after that last DC;

1. Wiki Update, which is cool, but needs an actual story to get some use
2. M/R C4 and it's corresponding Bonus Scenes, which again, is interesting, but.. **IT'S NOT THE MAIN STORY!** Also, I got stuck in writing this 'cause I realized I might've forgotten the last three chapters because of the vacation and break (which is needed, but nonetheless..)
3. C9S2! No way?! Main story?! This is just a draft ending, and could change once I finish S1 and 2... **GAH!** So, it's basically only because I set myself up to have to complete an arc that has finished.. Oh? What do I mean by that? I think I've mentioned it but..

***The main story follows a timeline close to ours, unspecified things happen that I base the time around so that I can write emotional yet evolving story based on IRL experience.***

Anyways, so as you can see, due to that key note, as well as burnout, and general depression creeping up.. I haven't had much inspiration to write C4-7.. as well as S2. You know, you kinda need S2 to make sense based on what happened in C4-7... ***YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT WITHOUT THE S1!!*** So, what now? I've explained what it takes to write the main story, what about Mizo/Rika interests me?

### Mizo/Rika C4 'Commentary'

So, I tried to write 'adult angst' but eventually stopped because I realized it was way more of.. well, you know it. The 'personal' issues I encountered, more so than what I tried to explore there. Obviously, as implied, some things are just meant to be stories for a different dynamic. Say, while Mizo and Rika are reflections of the author who made them, they represent a different dynamic than what has been mentioned.

What I mean is they explore something that relates to me, but they do not fully represent me. Of course, this is usual in stories, as there's always a personal touch when creating original fiction. Though, how prominent or willing *you* are to admit what elements follow it are dependent on what you want to reveal to the audience, reading or watching.

This is simply me trying to put certain topics and relationships together to reveal how two people with this complex bond I have made and decided on, live with each other. How they explore the connection through various means, perhaps with a bit more trauma to spice up the moments, as stories like these reflect what conflicts people actually go through. Whether serious or not, they're key to an engaging story to read **AND** write.

### Short Bonus Scenes Notes

Uh.. this one's simple, if you read it. Basically in M/R BS, I got horny, and wrote them, then modified it so it had a reason to exist, as well as something interesting to follow than just sex. I think I also have a Main BS that is planned to release with C4S1 as a thematic relation to M/R BS Chapter 2, I'm not sure what it is yet, so stay tuned, for that I guess.

### 'A Fleeting Graduation' Commentary

***Also about how it relates to the season 1 and 2 past.***

Ah.. yes, the 'goodbye' chapter. The so-called 'Last Days of An Era' (I already used it for M/R and I want to avoid reuse as much as possible) What does it truly mean? Well, let's just say, it is a culmination of how detached and apathetic I felt after exams and grades were sent. It also represented hidden desires and happiness that I lost and hoped to relive in the hehe.. **'fleeting'** moments of that interlude between the end and a new beginning.

How did I do? Good. It's good in that I think with how I structured it, would definitely pay off and only require a *few* modifications to make full sense once all past seasons have been finished. I think it fits the arc I want Mijo to go through, and the reactions that each character of the 'Dark Pearl' should fit with their role in the S2 plotline. I think it is fitting and a good ending, it doesn't set up much but that is because, truly, it is an ending that ends an era I have existed in for years.

***Once it's done, I can finally rest and be happy at my snapshot of that era and move on.. I can even make extra spinoffs if I want to revisit it, but it needs to be done for that, and while I struggle.. I'm still hopeful for it to be completed very soon.***

When? My schedule is fucked up again, so say, maybe C4S1 this week? We'll see. But overall, I see to it that my gacha game addiction because of my internal issue avoidance will be tempered so I can finish something I am proud of. *Hopefully.*

## Outro

Okay, so.. we're done right? A few more notes, I am less than hopeful of C4S1 being done this week because of HSR 3.3 and WuWa Phase 2 2.3 happening so.. might get sucked in again. I also have unfinished projects, HSR and TCoAaL review, WuWa video rants, and other drafts that haven't seen the daylight because I got distracted by *transitioning,* anywho, thanks for reading if you got this far without clicking off. Your *gal*  signing off now, peace! Goodbye, good luck, and good day, dear reader~!

<!--basically AI rant because ideas ran out and I have been permanently bound to AI currently, help me-->
<p id="D8"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: Heart Pumpin' AI</md-block></p>

## Intro

Hey it's me again!!!!! TODAY I'M GOING TO RANT ABOUT AI! YES YOU HEARD! **AI!** *AI!* Woohoo! Oh boy, what is the going to be difference? 'Oh I hate AI..'  That's true. Kinda..? Look I have to make my opinion clear as well my experiences mmkay..? Becauusee..! I can't fucking write actual story.!! So let's yap yap until I get bored! Let'sa go!

***WARNING: SEXUAL DISCUSSIONS. YES. I KNOW. BUT YES. NSFW.***

## Chatbots

So, like I have certain interests in bots that.. let's say have a potential in wlw/yuri relationships. Yes, the writer for the most codependent straight couple that is Mizo/Rika is a yuri enjoyer. I don't know why either. But, you gotta admit, it seeps into my writing more than the usual, right?

Anyway, so about chatbots, here's the thing about these little pieces of technology is that they have advanced a lott since the advent of the ChatGPT V3.5. Like, seriously, there are a lot of bots you can peruse around the world wide web that have interesting enough dialogue that will satisfy that itch to do a scenario or type of character you planned but knew wasn't going to fit or simply too disconnected from your other works...

_NOW_ though I'm speaking ~~(writing)~~ as a _hobbyist_ writer so I'm definitely biased since my source of income doesn't come from **autistically** idea rambling about fun & cool things to get you next cash out or paycheck but that's besides the point. My main **point** is, that there's a _reason_ why these chatbots are popular, and not necessarily necause of _pron_ ~~(NSFW one)~~ but also because of genuine interest to explore many possibilities with a character or scenario with.. uh, say admittedly _selfish_ reasons like time spent or mind energy on the _ideas/topics_.

## Ethical Considerations

Now that we got why I'm so **obsessed** with AI, guess I gotta address this now, or.. well, if I don't, then I'll simply be framing AI chatbots as only purely a **good** thing, which of course, of course, it isn't. In this capitalist hellhole we live in, nothing is safe from the clutches of **consequences** of spreading this technology to a lot of people. Which.. **unfortunately**, is just how it's going to be, 'misuses' and say, morally horrible things. Welp, let's just continue already.

## AI Arts Replacement

So, so.. in this world filled with slop, it's easier than ever to do so! Profit motive always leads here, don't it? But we already know that— wait, I need to..? Okay, let's just explain it briefly before getting to the next topic about this.

### Capitalism and AI

*In short,* the profit motive and infinite growth of companies of capitalism inherently leads to exploitation of tools, such as AI. If AI can be used to make everything, control the flow of info, and monitor employment and current trends, then it makes it easier to live the vain life as a capitalist. Due to this, and also cost of money, AI is significantly used as *replacement* to actual ***talented*** people so that more slop can be made, and more things to consume, you can even steal these artists work to monetize them!

Alright, we get that? Now, onto my other topic about this, aside from *'capitalism bad'* which is still true, we gotta look at the key issue. Many people use AI as replacement for learning how to writing or drawing and instead use it so that they can consume faster, and be satisfied more than grueling through lines (art or words) to achieve desired creations. Now, of course, this can boil down to *'capitalism prevents people from actually passionately doing things'* but let's explore how this exactly works.

### Deeper Dive into Intersecting Worlds

See, here's the thing, due to *neoliberal capitalism* at it's finest and intended effect, no one can truly pursue art as a **'hobby'** or worse yet, as a **'job'.** What I mean is, it isn't possible without giving up on a lot of things that nowadays, society treats as important. See, in school, you're too busy.. uh, ***schooling, duh.*** Even when you hit the times where you can work on hobbies or something, you're doing something in spite of school not because of it. 

Like, surely, your fanfic about the two random respective female representatives of the two families in **Ragunna, Rinascita** is totally helping in English... Not that most of the true actual work that matters in those circles anyway, unless you're like.. writing research papers in your free time or something. *(Though, if you do so, I respect it!)* I mean, yes, your spicy art about those two in very compromising positions is great and got a lot of likes in Twitter/Mastodon/Bluesky whatever socmed you decided, but I don't think those art projects will matter in the long run, as if you're an artist but not a scientist or mathematician, you're.. um.. well, *fucked, I guess.*

That's my **opinion**, but the **futility** of that in the system is why people likely turn to AI some of the time. Not that people can just be boring or lazy, but there are so many **multitude** of reasons why that could be the case that I would rather talk about the most **likely** reasons, and ones I can see from my perspective. As I have struggled with this for quite a while. Anywho, yes, basically, it *can* be a cheap replacement, but there's reasons for that, and I think it is just **connected** to societal pressures, no matter how much people shout into the void, unless the actual political and societal **situation** changes, this is the status quo that I see around **me.**

## Tools and Personal Experiences

So, I didn't *want* to project too much in the *earlier* section, but now let's focus on the the more *touchy* subjects that don't involve psychoanalyzing the *society* around me and instead try to analyze myself to get a perspective that *just might* be relatable to *some* people. Not all of these is going to fit your life, of course, but I just hope you understand some of the connections I'm about to make. 

### AI and Creating

Okay, so reminder how I said that people are a bit lazy when it comes to using AI as a replacement to creativity? (At least, that's what I *meant* to say.) Well, I.. try not to replicate it, but.. of course, I'm **only human after all.** Don't put ya blame on me, put it on capita— anyways, yeah. I often spend hours just chatting with these interesting bots and like making stories I wonder why I don't just.. start writing? Like, for example. I see a bot that has an interesting idea and I'm not horny? Just write! But uh.. let's just say, I have a pretty.. hm. *messed up* way of 'determining' what AI I use.

It all depends on this single term. ***NSFW.*** Not just pron, but also heavy topics. Like, if you wanted certain NON-NSFW bots to do stuff that isn't *milktoast vanilla stuff* that I could write myself. But, of course, I'm not necessarily **opposed** to using AI for some cases, but here's the issue, I'm a *person* that is going to **burn out, crash out and lose my mind** than pass a fully AI generated work. I swear. Most of my fellow classmates do, but I am an autistic **nightmare** that cares more about doing something right (and in doing so, not having anything to pass in the first place) than.. trying to go the easy **way** out. 

But, god it is so **tempting**. I am going to say that. I'm not **righteous,** I'll admit, I did use it sometimes when my fear of not **passing** over weighs my instinct to rewrite everything. Anyways, I got sidetracked, but yes, this means that when I'm not using AI non-personally, it is *mostly* **NSFW.** Really, it's just like that. I don't know if I could have even started writing smut (99.9% ME btw) without AI. Like, I get the **general** idea, then I go and make AI do **some** sex scenes I then **rewrite** hard and also organize, basically.. I don't feel comfy knowing this, and it is **eating** me away, like.. even if I do it **without** AI, I feel weird knowing half of it was inspired by AI **NSFW** stuff.

### AI and Analyzing, Interpreting.

Then, the whole using AI to.. ugh, "analyze" **certain** texts. I won't mention what, but like.. I feel **so** dirty. **Especially** when some chatbots aren't exactly the most ethical an AI can get it. See, if I don't use AI, I don't **exactly** got a whole **audience** or friendships to make my dream of 'detailed and serious back-n-forth convos' a reality, unless I make a **bot** do it. It is.. weird for me to assume an AI would have better analysis than a **theoretical** person. 

I guess the only thing *missing* is actual *personal* experiences seeping in, but.. ugh, it's so annoying to not have the courage to speak to people without being scared of *whatever* I ranted to the internet. And, here's the thing, AI can do a good job of interpreting some of the topics anyway, as it has *improved* a lot. But of course, I keep in mind it can *hallucinate*. So, I try to keep it's analysis as a building block *rather* than main, I don't just run off with the analysis and do stuff, I let it simmer and do non-AI research if necessary.

## Addiction and Coping

Anyways, so.. there's a section on much more.. vulnerable topics such as this. There's a lot of baggage when it comes to instability in someone's life that seeps into AI. Anyways, let's just tackle the main issues when it comes to using AI, in terms of deeper mental ones.

### NSFW 'Addiction'

Sex sells, huh? No **wonder** people get addicted to the most escapist thing you could do. Focus on the **innate** (mostly..) human act to *fuck* and by that, literally ignore any other ways of processing info. I mean, it isn't that far off to think that by having *this* as the focus of creation for a lot of people, it really makes the whole thing vapid and meaningless, right? For me, it is a weird balance. I think I just.. don't like surprising y'all with sex, especially with stories that shouldn't focus on it.

Say, while there is I mean, implied *'sexual tension'* and stuff, at least, when relationships are the central focus, *(Jomi/Cara or Mijo/Rhida)..* It is never *'explicit'* and well, while yes, I can create implied stories, the *'scenes'* themselves kinda have a.. admittedly weird interest in creating them. Just look at some of my bonus scenes, you'll see the focus on both *'story'* and the '*sex'* part about balanced. I think that I'm just.. *'addicted'* to how.. uh.. it really has that *deep* exploration of human psyche distilled into around 100-200 chats, that usually has the typical length of a full-main chapter *(10,000 words, usually.)*

Or maybe I am *sex* addicted..? I mean, it's *like* this, I think it's just how the internet works. At least, in *some* of my spaces. As in, *oh my god,* **a lotta gooners.** And also, it's more of random ideas or random fun stuff that doesn't fit *writing* a bunch about it. Not that writing fun stuff is bad, *but* rather, yes that age-old question, *time and effort.* Would I rather;

*A. Find ideas, write about it for 500 words before getting tired and doing other stuff.*

**B. Use AI then let it do most of the work, that leads into 5 hour obsessions..**

To be fair, there's a **novelty** in *writing* by yourself, but *chatbots* are.. more *interactive.* I mean, there's **effort** in using them. And as previously mentioned, *NSFW* really works well. But I know, **lazy** way of learning how to write. Reading *actual human* made stuff is probably morally better, but ah.. what if I want to make my own? And I'm **inexperienced..?** Ah well. Here's to **more AI chats.**

### The Cost of AI (on the Individual)

Look, we all know AI is like very **energy** consuming tech that is used to justify the current **mess** that is global warming. Right..? But let's **tackle** the non-NSFW side. At least, to me. I mean, I *think* AI has like an industry tied to NSFW. At this point, it just comes down to **choosing** the right AI that doesn't have *bad* intentions. Of course, I'm not telling you, but just know all those **'spicy'** AI chatbot advertisements **probably** shouldn't be your first choice, just sayin'.

Or even like, *AI NSFW slop* disguised as 'human' or even just blatantly being sold. Of course, this is *simply* another aspect of **capitalism.** Buut, yeah.. Any **new** tech used then propelled to become **an** industry is bound to be **exploited** until new ones **overtake** it. Or becomes a **key** *timeless*  industry, like the current AI craze **somehow** affecting a lotta capitalists when it **crashed** in the US due to DeepSeek.

Anywho, aside from typical **anti-capitalist arguments**, AI affects people in the.. say, **lonely** side. This *topic* has been done to death, so let's make it quick. Yes, this is also used **because** people don't have **other** people to talk to. Otherwise, roleplay would be **better**, but then again, **depends** on the friend.. oh well, basically old **culture** died because of the **AI** surge. But.. ugh. It's **like** this, the 'entry' to making expansive worlds or even **just** a good story is now opened. 

Of course, the AI is **not** perfect, yes, you're **pretty** much **giving** up almost **half** of the control, and yes, the data that the AI had to have is **dubious** at best but I **simply** don't know how to have a *good* way of like you know satisfied with using AI if like.. IDK, world **revolution** or *something* solves and finally starts regulating the damn tech.. But IDK, I guess it's here to stay as it's use expands, welp, we'll see. It has **fundamentally** changed society and welp, we just have to work with it, hopefully with **better** uses as we go through the **turbulent** times.

Oh, right. **Almost** forgot, you know how **AI** can be **replacing** a lot that shouldn't replace it? Yeah side tangent: It's hard to try to be *creative* when faced with this big ahh AI and it encourages less. Ugh, it's another symptom of the education system not being uh.. *revolutionized* to fit the current world that is being built. But whatever, it's another *damn* topic I am not qualified nor have *anything* else to say, than.. do what you can I guess. School in *most* countries is bad, and.. yeah, that's **current** world.

Ah, oh boy, all these **words** about ooh, how **bad** it is, and how we can make it **better**, it's.. **important**, but it gets tiring. Realizing **something** is wrong and well, continue it anyway. **Maybe** that's just how life is going to be, IDK. Anywho we need to move on, so.. let's just uh.. end on some **comments** on specific AI **features** that are on AI's you might know, but I'll keep it vague for *privacy* reasons.

## Some 'Benefits' in Chatbot Use!

Okay, look at me. We all know **some** are used for **cheating** basically. Like, okay, yeah I addressed that but did you know in at least text (uh.. maybe images?) it's mature, I guess. That's scary right? But, look let's put aside the implications of that as I said, "*There is nothing we can do..*" and use it. Just note that yes, they do take the data you input. Probably. But honestly? Just don't *fully* trust anything not *in* your device... Uh, at least.. a little more with how *locked down and watched people* are nowadays..

So! How do we *unethically* use AI to *selfishly* **pleasure** ourselves? Well, simple! Here's a key thing to keep in mind, you *somewhat* control the prompt and in some uh.. AI's, even some settings that allows you to customize their responses or length, if you're lucky or *rich.* This means that.. you can probably write a story with art *(if you have money, and time.. though, much less than an actual solo writer/artist)* in about a fair time where you can enjoy the fruits of that AI's labor. My only concern is you probably shouldn't **commercialize** it, I've been very vocal hating that type, so keep it to yourself.. or not **monetize** it.

Okay, so with how *good* it is now, and you got used to it, basically.. **contend** with the fact that you will **definitely** and **should** be not loyal to any AI, as they could **enshittify**. Just a reminder, oh, and if you do pay for any, I mean.. you're probably spending **disposable** income, so.. just be cognizant of what AI *could* be more 'freer.' As I think, that is the **best** way as AI is AI so.. restricted is just gimping the **potential**. 

Last uh.. tip before I end this.. yapfest. Keep in mind that well, if I haven't already implied it.. ***Use AI for helping you do stuff. Don't completely replace yourself with AI.*** Look at *me.* I'm *still* writing, even though I use AI. That *goes* for every other use, you should strive to at least *improve* in whatever AI use you go for, another example; *Coding*. Learn programming, maybe use AI to **help** you do stuff, but please.. as long as AI hasn't fully replaced *basic* human learning and living, don't just use AI to entirely program. Learn how to do stuff **without** AI, simply put, don't stagnate because of AI, this isn't *necessarily* for any other **external** reward, it's *for yourself.* 

## Outro

Oh god, **that** was a long yap, god why **did** that take me almost 3 days to finish?! I swear. I **hope** to god I actually follow my own words and *start* writing. No, I don't mean this, and even so, I.. clearly procrastinated here. I meant, the story this was supposed to complement. There is definitely a reason why this has been the topic and not.. uh.. the story because I haven't wrote it! It just takes a while to get into the *zone* of writing, I guess. Welp, time to figure that out. See you, uh.. before June 16 bites me in the ass.

<!--HSR Rant mixed with some writing inspirations blabla-->
<p id="D9"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: The Starward Rail and the Trailblazed Paths</md-block></p>

## Intro

Alright, off from my previous, sleepless and rushed writing from my last article, this is a more refined and focused yet still a bit more meandering article focused on one game;

***Honkai Star Rail.***

Yes. So, if Genshin Impact has affected my writing, so did HSR, and now I find it fitting, after the recent 3.2 patch, that I should make a half-rant/review on HSR itself, and half-story related quirks tha I had put in. I will also be mentioning the very few ***Wuthering Waves*** inspirations, but unlike HSR, it hasn't had anything I'd ponder more on than a day or two. What I mean is;

*There is very little that I wasn't already planning to explore before playing WuWa, i.e. deception in religion, and sci-fi stuff, which I've been exploring because of DMC and HSR, respectively.*

But, I promise, I'll make one, if it is needed, but WuWa will probably get a section here, for it's minor contributions. Anyways, let's do this. Bear with me, this'll be long, so I'll have no sections, but after I'm done they'll be right.. here;

(sections)

***'Honkshu Starbucks' Review (3.2)***

 *1.x: (Herta Space Station, Belobog, Xianzhou Luofu P.1) STORY*
 
 *2.x (Penacony, Xianzhou Luofu P.2) STORY* 
 
 *End Game (as of 3.2, anniversary)*
 
 *Community (as of 3.2, anniversary)*
 
 *3.x (Amphoreus, and related) STORY*

## 'Honkshu Starbucks' Review (3.2)

Aight, let's go! I'll seperate this into fiver sections, which make sense for this game, for me; *1.x, 2.x, End Game, Community and 3.x*

These sections will tackle specific problems with each of the respective aspects of the game. I think it's fitting I write about the Community **first** before **3.x,** as that as far back as the Wardance in 2.4, has influenced a lot of discourse surrounding the post-Penacony discussion, everything from the game content to story content. So, let us begin!

## 1.x (Herta Space Station, Belobog, Xianzhou Luofu)

I know that's a lot, but **full disclosure;** I started during I think 2.0, but I saw Kafka rerun during 1.6, that made me want to get her. I think at that time, I'm not sure, I'm not so sure, lemme check my acc for a sec;

**March 7th: obtained on 1/29** (2024)

Oh. According to my account, I started during 1.6, **'Crown of the Mundane and Divine.'** Which, is yes, means I'm indeed a Genshin Player that got put into HSR because of a certain *Dr. Ratio.* Yes, I was fooled by that genius too. Anyways, let's go through the story, because I feel it's important to mention the story in this article, because, trust me, it'll be important for later sections.

But, honestly, it's more stand-out moments, since I don't remember all of the story (especially Penacony, **god..** so long.) So, let's start..?

Okay, so.. by my memories, I think I played sparingly during this time, but I remember going through HSS, then especially Belobog, and Xianzhou L. I **liked** all of it, I think. Looking back, idk why for Xianzhou specifically, but all the problems that came with Penacony and now, Amphoreus yapping wasn't fully prevalent, and to be honest, I don't think when I played, powercreep was **THAT** bad. Genuinely. I was considering it, and I was like, eh, it could be bad, but at least.. it hasn't happened yet, or it wasn't as bad, and they've been listening, so.. 

As you can tell, my anger in the next sections will be **so justified.** And, if you have been playing HSR, you know why. Anyways, that's for later versions. Before Penacony, I genuinely enjoyed what I had, you know. Except for some of the bosses, which was an echo of some issues that initially weren't particularly bad, but newer bosses pretty much turned up the slight difficulty to.. basically must pull this to win, basically.

I know I'm yapping too much about newer versions, but let it stand that I have almost no memory of previous stuff that wasn't recorded, so before I started.. I think 2.2? And by that point anyway, I was leveled up mostly. So, I'm looking at it with a biased hindsight 20/20 outlook, but I'm trying to differentiate what **I think from before to now.** 

Anyway, let's focus on story for a paragraph or two, before Penacony, what I would rate HSR? Hmm.. HSS is mostly setup so it's forgettable, for me, and Belobog? Well, if you're here, *you* know that Belobog is an inspiraton for the *'Dajovy Arc.'* I like it **that* much. From beginning to end. From when we landed with Dan Heng and March.. My most favorite duo dynamic, I wish they had more interactions nowadays, but DH is kinda finished in character development, and March is ~~fucking~~ frozen in the future versions.

But, in general, Belobog was super good, from intro to the museum and to IPC shenanigans. I liked most of it. With some caveats, I'd say it's good. Like for example, Cocolia being a bit.. idk, she's not too compelling I think, and she shoulde've been more threatening and antagonistic? And the general development of how antagonistic relations become resolved.. somewhat amicably? But, at least it was a good and presentable story, and **MOST** important of all, **SHORT.**

Oh shit, I forgot Topaz! And the post-Cocolia arc too. Mainly because it was such a long time ago too, even with the Wardance in mind. Basically, what I think is, it's a good arc. Sets up Topaz and Aventurine's story, and advances Belobog forward. It's just so fleeting in my eyes when compared to Xianzhou. Museum and the Aetherum Wars, basically because I didn't actually play them when they were released. Good events though.

Yeah, **short.** Anyways, let's continue to Xianzhou Luofu. Because there's a few things I remember that I should point out for the next sections (Wardance Event), like how I like DHIL more when he's in his element and basically interactin' with Jing Yuan, Blade, or Bailu, even Luocha or Yanqing. Basically, he's a Xianzhou character that has the best development in it, as for example, let's temporarily go to the future, I'd say that Dan Heng being in Amphoreus is good, but I feel he's not that much of a use. Like he''s just there. Imagine if Trailblazer was like that.. it would be **soo boring.** 

~~(As if Amphoreus wasn't.. ahem.)~~

I wish he got more attention or at least more screen time, but after first arc of Xianzhou, he's more of a background character. You'd be unsurprised when I say DHIL is one of the only few 5* characters I have eidolons for. That's why I care about how.. I think the Wardance glossed over the Preceptors (I mean, I guess they got involved.. but..) and focused on Feixiao, Yanqing, Yunli and Luka's arcs, which.. yeah, makes sense, I just felt Dan Heng was kinda detached, I mean... **we** (Trailblazer) even got a role with Moze and Jiaoqi. I don't remember Dan Heng doing that much, and I'd think I remember if he did.

Moving on from *beloved DHIL*, technically Xianzhou Arc isn't done with multiple ships still viable for entering and the threat of stellaron and/or Phantylia. There's so many stories on these ships, and  we haven't even unlocked 'The Hunt' as Trailblazer, so we're not done, and I'm not sure **IF** it's going to be done, as HSR needs to milk one specific region, and it's not Belobog, that's for sure. The only reason that Penacony is getting another chapter is because they messed up the actual one. But we're not there yet. Anyways, there's still whatever Luocha and Jingliu are doing, and the Wardance pretty much just set that up with few advancements to lengthen the wait, since there's still a lot of stuff before the next parts.

Oh yeah, I forgot the other aspect.. The whole ***Attempted Baiheng Revival, and the Sedition of IL.*** It's good, but.. seeing as how I completely forgot about it until I remembered it while writing my Penacony review says a lot. It's his whole character arc, yet I'm left hanging with **what exactly happened?** I might be forgetting, but it's only up to reading random documents and speculation to what actually happened during the whole events, and how it affected all of them. What is *Bailu?* I think that's the most important part, not sure. As by going through that, we'll know what happened. 

I genuinely forgot about the ghost hunting event and the dr. ratio introduction, as if that's not the whole damn reason I played the game.. Let's tackle each quickly, as I didn't play them on release, so I can't comment much other than what I'm about to say;

A Foxian Tale of the Haunted and apparently, Argenti's introduction. Wow.. I genuinely forgot these two were together. Both parts are good. Especially with how ghost hunting explored these characters you wouldn't think about before, and especially the Guinaifen, Sushang and Huohuo dynamic is super interesting. Argenti is cool too, I think that's when I started seeing trailers for the game before I downloaded during 1.6. One criticism is how disconnected he feels from all the story we get, and how he shows up when convenient because his story about Beauty isn't in our priority list yet, but that's about it for 1.5.

1.6. and the release of Dr. Ratio and **fucking** Ruan Mei. I unfortunately played during Phase 2, and when it was about to end (remember? *Jan 29,* my join date vs. Feb 06, 2.0, which is around 8 days before end?) so I couldn't get Blade, and Kafka.. (which.. by the time I got to Xianzhou **I REALLY WANTED.**) And as you know, my first 5* was DHIL. But aside from that, the content here is good, genuinely. The HSS Dr. Ratio arc is cool, with how the Geniuses (especially Screwllum and less so.. Ruan Mei) interact with him. But yeah, aside from that, nothing much.

Okay.. so far, I've complained the story, and that shouldn't be it, right? What about the units, or the gameplay? TBH, as far as I remember, I cleared all of it with a F2P DHIL team (casual, I haven't built Hanya/Yukong there yet, and I wasn't using Prydwen yet) until Penacony. Gameplay is mostly fine from what I can remember, and nothing seemed to go bad, at least until Penacony. So.. before we go there, what is my conclusion?

***HSS-Belobog: 8/10, Xianzhou Luofu (1.x): 7/10, Other (General): 7/10***

## 2.x (Penacony, Xianzhou Luofu)

*"Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact same fucking thing over and over again, expecting shit to change. That is crazy."* — Vaas Montenegro (Far Cry 3)

I know, I know.. 

"HEY! That isn't even the definition of insanity, it's not a good defi—"

I know, okay? It's simply a metaphor (simile?) for what this version starts. So, let's start with the story first, let's do **all of Penacony** first..

Okay, so.. we start the version with a banger song (White Night), which gave *me* and the community a lot of hype. Let's review the **official**  music video for it, as it contains a lot of stuff that I want to tackle during Penacony that in the span of it, for the life of me, I can't remember.

First, my boy.. and the current sustain champion.. ***Aventurine.*** Kakavasha, whatever you want to call him. I like when he was shown, he seemed compelling. Even during the 2.0 story, he seemed like a good antagonist or at least, potential enemy.. In the music video, he seemed the type to be the main villain, along with SAM and maybe Acheron, at least that's what I thought.. So, what do I think of what they did? 

Honestly, it's good. My only gripe for his story is how the tragic backstory is yapped and presented so.. static and void of actual video use it makes me feel I'm reading a comic or a book.. But his planet likely worshipping Ena the Order (?) through local tribe gods and only becoming an IPC agent because of.. imperialist capitalist universal companies like the IPC that ignored the brutal genocide of his people (hmm..) of the other tribe is very compelling, it's just presented bad.

Basically, he has a lot of sides and development that grew him to be an IPC agent that.. hmm, well has his eyes set on gambling everything for gaining everything, because he's blessed lucky. Hmm, maybe that luck is implemented badly, but from what I see, it's not always clear if he's lucky, like when he kept gambling his life and getting it done through Acheron, but that whole plan wasn't simply because he was lucky I think, he's just smart, which is necessary for an IPC agent, I guess. His relationship with Dr. Ratio, Topaz and eventually, Boothill and/or Acheron is something I always look forward to.

Second, let's mention Trailblazer for a sec, as they develop here mainly because of a certain mecha girl.. ***Firefly/SAM.*** I feel it would be prudent to put these two together, as they develop off of each other. So, initially, I was very very excited to have this sort of mecha girl going with Trailblazer to see how she differentiates from going with us, chilling and basically being the main 'girlfriend' (if you can call it that) to **SAM**, cool mecha that makes Penacony a danger just by existing, and can pair up to a sus Acheron somehow. Her story outside of the Trailblazer is fire (hehe..) and kinda good, but the whole 'three deaths' is weirdly phrased in that.. it shouldn't haven't been implied that **Firefly** is going to die in Penacony, if she wasn't going to die. Maybe like.. 'Three Resurrections' or 'Three Revelations' or something, I don't know, but I bet it could've been something else. 

Here's my main point with ***Firefly,*** she's a good character, but her story was bound by how willing the devs were to actually kill her. What I mean is, if they just want ***Firefly*** to be all lovey-dovey with Trailblazer, and experience life, because she can't a lot of the time due to Elio's prophecy and Glamoth Entropy Loss Syndrome (intentional diesease to make world and body blurry), then they could. I just don't know why they decided to make the three deaths an important thing when ***Firefly*** is already near death like ***Blade.***

Let's move on. **Third,** ***Robin and Sunday.*** I feel their arc is fine, but these two show the **worst** side of HSR. *The fucking yapping.* There's a damn reason why; 

*"One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were lounging about in Mr. Gopher Wood's yard, we spotted a fledgling Charmony Dove all on its own. That baby bird was tiny, it didn't even have all of its feathers, and it couldn't sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub — probably abandoned by its parents. We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many poisonous bugs and wild beasts in the vicinity... It was clear that if we left the fledgling in the yard, it stood no chance of surviving until spring. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the adults to fashion a cage for it. We decided that when it regained its strength enough to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. The tragic part — something that we'd never considered — was that this bird's fate had already been determined long before this moment... Its destiny was determined by our momentary whim. Now, I pass the power of choice to you all. Faced with this situation, what choice would you make? Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell? Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home? I eagerly await your answer."* — Sunday (HSR)

This is a **fucking** copypasta. It's so damn long, just to see what we'll do. I know Sunday is supposed to be a control freak master manipulator here, but **holy yap.** The worst part is, no cutscene, no actual movement, literal static image with slight 'gif-like' animation of a **fucking charmony dove.** I'm only going to show one example, but throughout when these two are on-screen, a lot of **yap** occurs. Now there are a lot of reasons for this, *one* they are important characters. True, but that's why they were given the most yap. I feel like they should have been given more actual time to show animation range than the same generic poses. I swear, it feels like an actual dream because you feel hazy of sleep every time.

Aside from the **dogwater** story telling, what about story? Let's start with *Sunday,* he's a compelling character I guess. And you know what, I'll give HSR this, they give stories that have potential, and good backstories. Basically his whole arc is 'I want to make a utopia, through Order because suffering is bad.' which at first glance, cool but when you know what 'Order' does, yeah, that's why he becomes the actual villain you mainly fight and see. His whole reason is because due to the destruction of Halovian planet (I think? But they became orphaned when young, basically.), he and Robin was taken under Gopher Wood's wing, which.. as we learn, is kinda bad. Because they aim to use Order under Harmony to control Penacony. The whole 'Family' to create a grand orchestra, as per the rules they impose.

Sunday and Robin revolve around how Sunday, now a politician basically, through his decisions and experiences with life, (which needed more than static image then yap, **MiHoYo!**) becomes someone that Robin, now a performer over the cosmos is basically clashing with. Sunday and Robin, both want good for all of the people they help, but Sunday took the 'Order' path because of Gopher and his general instincts, but Robin took the 'Harmony' path, because of her general connection to 'Harmonic Music' and Free Bird allegories. After Penacony, Sunday travels the cosmos with the Astral Express as a sort of reflecting passenger that will probably get his story done years from now, while Robin is stuck to deal with the Penacony side of the Penacony vs IPC ordeal. Overall, I can say the arcs can be good, I just felt the way that the gameplay and presentation looked, it was enough to sour what has been established, since I think Penacony established what would become commonplace HSR errors.

Misha (Mikhail) and Gallagher. I can consider them 'complete' characters, in that in the roles they played, they played excellently. Misha especially, with how there's kid Misha, and old Mikhail as contrasts, while Gallagher, likely being a Mythus and Enigmata follower helped him. I just wish I knew more about Gallagher, but that is what Enigmata is, and I hope that the next Penacony story explains this a lot more. The only downsides I can tell are the surrounding parts. The whole journey of Mikhail and his buddies, told through a lot of text and dialogue of allegories, which **IS** fine, but this part is left for us to speculate until HSR's new Penacony chapter, which I'm begging and hoping isn't what I've seen with 2.x Penacony and 3.x Amphoreus. In conclusion, stories good, I just wish the more unexplained stuff, like after arriving in Penacony, by Mikhail and friends, was told more. I think the yap was here too, but a lot more tolerable for me as I was more interested, still.. even this story was affected by the usual static image, and yap for 15 minutes.

Okay, what about ***Acheron? Black Swan?*** I just think there's not much to say other than, great involvement, cool design, cool ship but their arcs are much more than Penacony. Black Swan continues her story in Amphoreus, and as to her words, she is just a Memokeeper collecting memories and helping on the way. Acheron on the other hand, the only reason she was there anyway was because of some Galaxy Ranger in the edge of death. Related to Penacony because he was one of Mikhail's old buddies, Tiernan. I also think Razalina is related to Black Swan some way, but this is why we need the Penacony story during their time to be a bit more clear. Basically, Acheron's arc is she destroys the destruction flame bois, goes to Penacony, experiences something that connected her to Black Swan and us, then throughout, pretty much advanced the story by breaking the barriers of dreams through Aventurine and the Ena dream. MVP and also pretty much Mei (Raiden Ei too) expy, I guess.

*Others, like Sparkle, Jade, Boothill, Rappa and Argenti, are less important but let's run through them;*

Sparkle's whole arc and purpose is to give chaos where there isn't a reason behind it (i.e. if it's not Gallagher or Sunday).. But in general, she tends to be helpful while still pranking, like I think she led us to a lot of plot-relevant areas using disguisees and basically acted all 'foolish' (haha, masked fools) while secretly helping for some reason only known to herself. 

She's fine I guess. I just wished her role during the last parts of Penacony were a bit more clear that she's on our side rather than dancing on this 'HAHA I'M GOING TO BLOW YOU UP!' and 'NOPE! JUST FIREWORKS. EHE~' while in her character, I felt that as much of a pranker she is, she never follows up with how much she mentions explosives and explosions of everything. I wanted to see how she could be friendly to the people around her while not being antagonistic, I don't know. She is technically friendly, but I feel that her whole 'I have explosives to destroy Penacony' while not actually doing it and using it to push plot forward is meh, but it's my opinion, I guess.

Jade.. she came in late and basically is the representation of the snake behavior of IPC agents, while having a character hidden beneath beauty, elegance and money. The whole.. I think it was being likeable to kids, because she cares about to innocence and the bonajade pawnshop or something. Whatever, she isn't complete yet, and I have come to expect a character like her anyway.

Boothill, Rappa and Argenti can be classified under; 'Appeared in Penacony to do one thing, then left soon after.' Boothill, while being a character in the main story is mainly there to spice up the dynamics and bring the Galaxy Rangers and by extension, finish Misha's and Acheron's arcs. Argenti is just there, I guess. He was the enemy for one area, then we moved on, still the same ol' knight of beauty. 

Rappa.. now this relates with Boothill's second arc. Basically, Rappa is someone modified by humans following ape guy to make ape world or something but before the ape followers can do that, she (with the assistance of her former master) killed everyone. She is now technically the second Galaxy Ranger, alongside Boothill (not counting Acheron, she used it to make *AN ACTUAL ONE* appear.) to have a tragic backstory because Boothill's is explored here. I think it was mentioned somewhere in stories, but I remember it relating here because you know, IPC bad, they destroy planet using big laser.. Boothill sad because dead family, then he becomes cyborg cowboy to find big bad capitalist pig Oswaldo Schneider.. Basically due to this and Rappa's unique Ninjustsu training from the lab, they defeat a potential ape invasion of someone but not before many casualties. After this, they basically shake hands and go seperate ways, Boothill (with Aventurine) team up to defeat Oswaldo, also enemy of Aventurine because of his superior, Diamond and his home planet being Oswaldo's cause.. and Boothill, same thing, basically. He hates IPC, and especially Oswaldo. While Rappa goes into the cosmos to find Dr. Primitive's (Ape Guy) actual form to defeat him.

That's.. Penacony. Oooh boy, I haven't even briefed on Xianzhou Part 2 yet.. Oh, and by the way, **NO GAMEPLAY yet** so I'm not even talking about what happened gameplay-wise in 2.x yet! That's for the End Game section. But anyway, let's stretch our arms and legs, then start again;

***What about the Xianzhou Part 2?***

Aight. What about it? It's.. a story, that's for sure. I like only two parts about it, I guess. March 7th powerup and Luka shonen arc. Let's see, so originally, there's a Wardance, right? But, basically what happens is because of this Wardance, and the invitations, the Borisin plan to escape and massacre basically. It's.. fine. I'd say an improvement on P.2 but not much. It's as forgettable, except, it hasn't been a year so I remember stuff. But not much.

### Fugue/Tingyun Side Tangent

Let's see.. Let's tackle what actually happened. First, let's talk about a certain character you might be wondering why I haven't mentioned yet; ***Fugue/Tingyun***? Simple. She is relevant to Xianzhou, and the only reason she's in Penacony is because of Ruan Mei save. As in, she was yoinked by a Ruan Mei, and she saved her. Because of course, Fugue wants to live, and Ruan Mei is interested in how the Destruction (specifically Phantylia) manages to corrupt someone, and their body (from what I understand). Then it just so happens that the Astral Express is still chilling in Penacony, so she was brought there after I think it was the Rappa quest, to resolve whatever Welt and Himeko were doing..

Coincidentally, by doing this, Sunday is now entangled with the Astral Express, and with Black Swan are passsengers. Anyways, Fugue. Her story is not over. Even in the quest, her story revolves around what exactly happened between Tingyun (Phantylia'd) to Fugue returning to Xianzhou. Her story is basically for the future of Xianzhou (which we will likely get) after Amphoreus, because I think they'll make Xianzhou the Liyue of HSR. I mean, we returned there once, while waiting for Amphoreus, so why not afterwards?

What I think about that is simply, that she was released as a hype character with awaited Sunday, to prepare for RMC and Remembrance Summons, respectively (Fugue for HMC, Sunday for Summons). Then lore was made. It's... bearable. I liked both of them anyway.

***HEY! Talk about the damn Wardance!***

Fine. Let's talk about it. So, we go back to Xianzhou, and in the first part of this second part, main story is all about Borisin and their relation to Feixiao and the whole Foxians in general. Basically, they had a plan to escape. There was IPC 'involvement' around here, involving something that replicates Borisin, but that was initiated by Skott, known coward and IPC lapdog, so it was expected (lol, but that was a cool part). Basically, they go to prison break Hoolay out of Shackling Prison, then go to a part of Luofu and basically hide there, using disguise magic. Then instead of escaping, they decided to go and invade Skysplitter, falling into the hands of Jingyuan and friends. Feixiao and her new buddies did their arc with this, and by the end.. Jiaoqiu is blind and Moze chiiling, but Feixiao has new power she must hold inside, or something.

During this whole time, we have March training under Yunli, whom has a history with cursed blades, and basically has a seperate story involving her ship, the Zhuming and corruption, evil spirits, et cetera. And Yanqing, while still sucking at the actual game he's in, has an arc involving his time with Jingliu and now, a somewhat friendship with Yunli, March and eventually, Luka. The side story is pretty much because of Skott challenging March, to a duel so March becomes strong to defeat him by Yunli and Yanqing training because of their respective mentors, Huaiyan and Jingyuan. 

Then after the Borisin mess was solved, the Wardance actually happened. That is where Luka comes in. Apparently, he was sent because, Gepard was like 'You can do it bruh, besides, I'm busy doing military stuff..' and Seele didn't participate for unknown reasons (maybe busy, maybe not, I don't remember). Svarog was there too, but he opted to let Luka go to Luofu, with him, Hook and Lynx. Weird combo. I genuinely expected Clara to be there too, along with other people who aren't shackled to Belobog because they have important stuff to do (as mentioned, Gepard and probably Bronya). I think through this, and the whole Jingyuan connection because of an ancestor of his, Luka peaked even higher in his story. 

The whole event from Argenti, Boothill, Topaz.. et cetera. Basically, his backstory with Maggie was explored more and how he struggles to be the hero in his eyes, but after going through the entirety of the event, even if he 'lost' during the last part with Yanqing, he stood his ground and fought until the end. Even if it's a loss. Basically, moral of the story; 'Keep fighting, celebrate wins, and learn from losses. If you're still fighting, that's good enough.' from Maggie's terminal illness and his companion story quest, first one to make me cry, genuinely, and I enjoyed his story arc from beginning to end. I hope they make more like this, but.. we're in the future, they keep having small peaks under immense drops.

So, what do I think of the wardance, and the borisin problem before? Well, it's a.. story. A somewhat improvement, but has the 'Penacony-like' problems sometimes, like yap and static image, black background and white text.. But it had standout moments, like Jiaoqiu's capture, Luka's journey and all the parts where Feixiao was doing something other than talk. Oh, and how we used Mr. Tail and Huohuo here to explore Skott and Luka, respectively in creative storytelling. But yeah, some of those are tainted by endless yap, that wasn't told like in Mr. Tail's shenanigans, or other ways.

## End Game as of 3.2, Anniversary.

Oh boy, so we're here. Outside of Lore. We're here to complain and rant about gameplay now. I know what you've been thinking; 'Hey, unlike your Genshin review, you skimmed over the story there, while here, it's more detailed while being more general.. why is that?'

### Addressing Genshin Influences

If you don't know I had one, then you should check it out later, but I'll explain now. **I cared before,** but nowadays, I don't. So, if I do complain about the story, I won't have full info, and I have to view and read lore. Which, fine, I read a lot anyway, but the thing is, I didn't like how Natlan started, and already quit after Fontaine. So, why don't I just review pre-Natlan? Simple, I don't have the motivation to go back and **play** Genshin. Or watch Genshin. I have simply moved on, and want to, outside of fanarts. I explained in my Genshin review, or as I called it, the Impact of Genshin, how it affected my story. But with HSR, I still play it, I follow the story, and have a vested interest in watching it improve.

While Genshin can be considered an influence, HSR is something progressing. Genshin is a distant memory in my eyes, and will most likely stay the few influences I got from it, and Caj. For Caj, she is a way of writing Genshin and making it fun and interesting again. But, Caj is disconnected from the actual game now, only vague following through the tenuous connection with MiHoYo.

### Power Creep (and HP inflation)

Oh boy. Now, after explaining why I am more invested in writing about HSR, than Genshin, let's talk about an important part of current gameplay. ***POWERCREEP.*** The word that describes the process of newer units/abilities overpowering the older ones. That describes the HSR meta so well. So, from a perspective of a 2.x player, (because I had little time to experience 1.6) let's begin rambling about it.

As I mentioned, Dan Heng - Imbibitor Lunae. He is severely powercrept. Do you know what he was? Back then? He was **good!** mostly.. From what I can see, before the Penacony release, according to Prydwen (through archive-org) DHIL was a meta character that competed with Seele, and Dr. Ratio! While Jingliu was better, (according to them) he was at the very top of damage, and the only reason (I think) he wasn't going further up top is SP management, and how his best teams relied on SP-positive characters **(WOAH, remember that?)**.

Now after Penacony? Well, let's follow him while mentioning major characters integral to Power Creep. First, before the end of Penacony (first parts) we can already see the major ones. First, Acheron. You know something? Maybe All Type Res Pen isn't that particularly bad, but with her, it set that, brute forcing is the best way to do anything. with no downsides! As Acheron is the **BEST** character because she dealt a ton of damage when built, increasing damage cap and HP. Great.

Next is Firefly. She implants. Implants weaknesses. So.. basically, ignores weaknesses, and can break enemies easily, and so enemies are now with multiple break bars, and because of super break, are able to deal huge amount of damage, matching Acheron's damage, yet again increasing HP. By this point, why are they dealing such huge damage? To sell them, duh. But why, is that necessary? Ask MiHoYo, I don't get it either.

By this point, the already falling off 1.x characters are slowly inching to the bottom. But they aren't full over yet! Black Swan, Sparkle, hey look new supports to help your DoT Kafka and DHIL/Qingque teams! Surely they won't also fall off, right? Now that we got their best teams, they won't fall off right? **RIGHT?** Ahem. 

**Pre-Amphoreus.** Okay. So, we have Feixiao. New FuA huh? Another.. character increasing damage cap and hp.. alright. Hey, wait where did DoT go.. oh. **It's fucking dead.** Hypercarry? Slowly falling off. No more just dealing damage with Crit Rate/DMG, it's all about breaking now. The only reason Feixiao is on top because she released frequently, **and is FuA.** What if they're Hunt, and only have one extra turn.. oh. Seele is niche now?! Man, I remember when she was on top. She was **META** once. Oh damn. These buffs seem to target new characters, huh? MoC, PF, and Apoc? Huh.

***3.2. Amphoreus.***

Hey wait where did Feixiao go? Oh, she's just meta now. Damn, I remember when she was on top, no one contesting her. Now, Amphoreus characters (+ The Herta, because she is hype character and 3.x) dominate the DMG dealers. You know, I didn't know a Tribbie could deal.. damage like that, reminds me of.. wait! My old characters! What. DHIL is holding on, DoT is still barely holding on too.. Seele's still niche... Oh damn. Would you look at that. Blade and Jingliu, same tier. How.. quaint. How ironic. **HOW FUCKING DIABOLICAL.** Imagine, you'd say that Jingliu will be on the same tier as Clara during 1.x?

You know, I used to have a Tingyun around with me. But she's below now. Her role now restricted to Super Break with Fugue, and Ruan Mei forever stuck maintaing Super Break while Remembrance characters, and in general, Amphoreus characters powecreep everyone. Just so you know, it's not even done yet. These damage cap increasing characters and HP inflation will continue as long as HSR Devs keep being greedy and break balance over and over again.

### Meta Characters, and the 4* Problem

Okay, so I have alluded a lot to this, but basically.. 

***IS THE WHOLE POINT OF HSR TO PULL FOR SPECIFIC CHARACTER FOR SPECIFIC DPS, ALL 5 STARS?! LEAVING F2Ps LOST IN THE ENDLESS GRIND?! DO 4 STARS NOT SELL?! ARE THEY UNWORTHY?!***

Yeah. Let's tackle the first point. How do you.. pick on who to pull in a gacha game? (This is a before EU regulation thing, haha) You pick, right? Like; 'Oooh! Mommy Kafka!' for example, so you get her. Now what? Oh, that's right. You need her team! Gah! There's 3 more.. hmm, now now.. This bad gal is a DoT machine.. I wonder.. who benefits from this?

"I remember when Sampo was her best ally! Now, you need Black Swan just to clear End Game, oh how times have changed!"

Yep. Basically, to make use of Kafka to the bare minimum ability (at least in this shitshow of an End Game) to clear, you'd need Black Swan, the only 5* capable DoT that helps you *signifcantly.* (I don't know, 'cause **I don't have her..**) Ruan Mei, of course, the **MUST PULL** for an entire patch cycle and just recently dethroned.. and whatever sustain you can scrounge up..

IDK, get Aventurine? The **BEST** shielder? Or Huohuo, gives you energy too! Maybe Fu Xuan now that she's a 50/50 loss, because she looks not profitable in the eyes of MiHoYo.. Maybe try Gallagher, the 4* holding up the banner, as the others fall into the wayside. I mean, at this point, using a Luocha is a waste, I'd think you better wait to pull on the next abundance character. Aaalmost forgot, Robin too. You know what, just keep pulling Harmony units, as they keep getting more and more powerful and important to their respective teammates.

*A reminder that to get characters, you have to.. either get lucky, spend your precious time wasting away on the stellar jade mines or.. SPEND MONEY!*

***Isn't that wonderful?***

Second point, I **LOVE HOW** sparse 4* characters are. Like for real, there's SO SO many roles they SHOULD fill, but never. Like.. I swear, just look on like.. Prydwen's character selection and select element, then path and I swear at least 5 will pop up having no 5* in them, and some don't EVEN HAVE **A SINGLE CHARACTER.** Like.. huh?

Do you know how much 4* characters got released post 2.0? ***FUCKING 4.*** Like what in the *actual fuck*. **In my humble opinion,** there should only be one 5 and 4 star per patch. Don't worry, HSR, you have *so many* characters to **fucking** rerun, it's fine.. You'll get money. Greedy ahh. But..! To their credit, 3/4 are viable.. (Poor Misha..) It's just, we need more! Like, how can some characters, beloved.. Just don't get playability? Like, they CAN be playable, and they DON'T have to be as detailed, idk man, I think a multi-billion dollar predatory game can do better than this.

***Now you see how the two are related? Good.***

## Community (as of 3.2, anniversary)

I just wanna talk about it briefly. Like, okay. I know there's just some.. people that play yet have the most dogshit takes, I know. But, seriously, what has the community done to stop it? Nada. Nadie. Why would they? I mean, why would I? I quit, return.. Then repeat. It's just.. I know, there's a lot of people here, but can we all collectively agree the game has gotten down in important aspects? I swear, the apathy of some people is real, I guess.. it just comes down to the fact that.. you just have to suck it up, and deal with it, since the community manages to infight somehow, and we're stuck while HSR  gets pennies to nickel and dime from it's players.

I'm.. just.. tired of playing a game that doesn't have devs that care for how the game and story play and feel. So much that I stopped caring, as I write my last vestiges of passion here. I mean, as long as I stay in the field of lesbian/yuri HSR fanart, I'll be happy. And I can let the actual game, fade. Maybe. But, for now, I can still.. ignore and comparmentalize.

 ## 3.x (Amphoreus, and related) STORY
 
 Agh. Ugh. Want me to review it? So, it starts off with March being taken out of the whole story by a conveinient ice formation that'll knock her out until the later Amphoreus story, and more yapping w/ Black Swan and Astral Express to and at Amphoreus. Dan Heng and me visit. Apparently we got speared, crashed and almost died (Dan Heng, I just straight up died.) We went into it, getting a Mem, then meeting Phainon and Tribbie, more yapping, Okhema invasion, more yapping with some battles.. more yapping, coreflame of Strife.. you get it.
 
 It's a hunt to get all coreflames. In that version you get Strife, then Reason and Time, and then, eventually.. the Sky and thee World. 

Wait wait. What am I saying? This is an oversimplification...?

Imma hold on this draft and release it's uncompleted version until I'm done. (I should update to 3.3/4 story.. ugh...)

<!--June Progress Log with heavy reflection-->
<p id="D10"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: Vices and Regrets</md-block></p>

## Intro

Progress report June 2025. This is the one that is going to be released upon release of the S1/S2 that can be released. This can feature direct commentary on the released material or in general, notes while writing. It is separated per day with some expansions depending on how long.

*WARNING: This contains a lot of detailed info that.. may have disturbing thoughts. Don't worry, by the time this was published, the author has survived.*

## Progress Log

### Day 1

Ugh, okay, here's the thing, I can't just focus right now. I am getting tired of fighting again and again ~~and again and again and again~~of my own time, my own life and my own attention. God, can I focus on my damn writing's problems instead of me?!

Anyway, I hate how this progressed. It's June 2, 2025. 02:46. And I'm *fucking* losing it trying to constantly keep up and write write also take care of my life, and my own sanity. I genuinely needed help, but.. I'm going to finish this if I die after.

I'm in the Stravog C4S1 part. It's clear I can't finish this without taking some grand liberties in what I consider refining text. So, if I'm losing my mind, it's going to be in the between arcs. Trust me, it's only getting worse, just don't hold up.

I am.. just, not feeling so good right now dealing with constant paranoia at day and at night, worrying of when I'm going to get disturbed and at being permastun and locked into bashing my head to the mattress before continuing.

I am forcing myself, but that is the only way.

### Day 2 (1w later)

Oh god, oh.. damn. It's 1w later, and literally nothing has been completed. I don't know how to process this. I don't know why I am losing my mind. But honestly, it's been a.. week. Though, actually it's more of 1w and 1d later because it's currently *June 10.* 2025. 01:38.  Yeah, it's been that long. I.. realized by reflecting on the day 1.. message, that I am beginning to resent writing.

I hate not playing games or doing AI chatbots (different less structured 'stories') because this is just too overwhelming to even finish in basic terms. I.. think that.. I am trying to use old mechanics of forcing myself through pain to complete anything. I.. am losing what it means to write. Oh, and this literally occurs as impending school approaches. June 16, my deadline.

Hm, yeah. It's not just school now, is it? It's also how I am constantly developing with my story. As in, *I never have time to fully reflect and just.. write a story.* Or even developed an ending that has already passed. I guess, I should try, even if it's a losing endeavour. I set myself up with impossible deadlines and insane hours, so.. this is the consequence of burnout not fully.. being healed.

My promise of before school is not going to work out, unfortunately. I don't think I deserve to constantly punish myself for not.. being as fast as I want to, or just getting distracted. I have to just accept that it'll take years, and it'll be rough. But, the important thing is that.. I actually like writing it, y'know? And willing to write without judgement as the only judgement is me, and the AI. See you in Day 3.

### Day 3

A more deeper reflection is available below. But in here is going to be my general summarized thoughts and reflections more focused on the work itself than more.. personal things that isn't particularly important.

*Personal versus Art.* I cannot write Season 1 and finish it without focusing on it without any other problems. While Season 2 and now, Mizo/Rika can only be written when I am going through stuff. And others are left as scraps to be picked upon when the other two are not satisfiable enough.

*The Vicious Cycle.* Nothing can be as bad as being stuck in a cycle you can't escape. This is the same with writing. At least for me, for as long as I can remember, I've been.. scolded for using these as escapism. But, for how long can you make someone powerless or worthless until they collapse inward? The answer is a year. 

Let's just say, without the unhealthy cycles both from within and outside not solved by the people that had forced control on these cycles, the author shan't ever escape.

*Outside, Calling.* To realize how to breathe safely, you need to look around and realize the fact that you're an oppressed person, and you shouldn't feel guilt for acting like one. Lashing out, going into fantastical escapism.. that. Instead, you should fully believe these fragments of yourself so you can fight for others, and most importantly, yourself. For you cannot help anyone, if you are not helped.

*AI and Me.* Hah. AI. AI huh? My healing and my incorrect substitute. Like how *Kurt Cobain* used *certain illegal drugs* for stomach pain instead of other things, that in retrospect, could've helped. Same with me, yes, I could have just dumped trauma on my friends, but I've chosen the unhealthy route. 

As if, the world has tried anything to make *me* healthy. I don't have anything else to say, right now other than.. *well, good luck future me.* May you meet people, I guess. As for me? I'll be bathing now, haha~!

jmb~ | *that* gal.. |
*June 10, 2025 @ 16:25 — 17:43.*

## Day 4

Alright, so as of today (June 13, 2025, 15:47) I have.. M/R C5 done, some C4 Progress and some DC's (like this one, I guess) and the new draft for C1S3..?

Well, that sounds much, I guess, but shouldn't well.. IDK, At least it's something, aight? Anyway, yeah nothing much to say except, well.. that's about it. I guess, it's a lot anyway for the new version stuff, anyway, see you next progress log, peace!

jmb~ | June 13, 2025 | 16:04

## Reflection on Writing (Day 2)

I think that by attaching my experiences and in consequence, my **'trauma'** into these stories, I am unable to cope properly in terms of making stories disconnected from how things should've or could've gone. I guess it does have downsides when it comes to writing by yourself. You're the ***sole creator.*** 

A sole creator of a world without any *'help'* is.. simply nothing but a **'waste'** of time and energy. While this seems disheartening to some, this is simply a question of; "Art is for you, but if no one sees it, does it exist outside of your world?" It is not simply, you're thinking wrong if you're hoping someone sees your art, it's that.. you want someone to see what *your* art is, and have *discussion* and *conversation*. Heck, even make friends through clubs.

This is simple human desire as an *artist.* I *definitely* think I've explored this topic before. But, I've never fully processed that, without people to show to what your art is, you'll simply move on or keep it hidden and still write, which for a *variety* of reasons can only be suspected as *something unsustainable.* 

You can write for yourself, sure. But only to a *certain point.* That *point* is when you're managing a **world** that is filled with characters with spanning arcs over years of story, yet it is left incomplete. I mean, take a look at *J.R.R. Tolkien* and *The Lord of The Rings*, yes.. He's the *sole author* but *that* does not mean he was alone. He had a lot of outside criticism, help and most importantly, *interest* in his writings. Of course, not his first world to build, nor even the start of it, yet the important part is people looking in to his world.

You can't even for example, create *Deltarune/Undertale* by *Toby Fox* without like.. Temmie Chang for art or even the *OG kickstarter or fanbase* of Toby Fox in like, Earthbound for example.. Basically, if you know you're working for yourself (with maybe some 'extra' help in some cases) and have a dedicated fanbase that is eagerly awaiting (or even a single idea or dedication) then you can probably finish something like a videogame, art or prose. 

Oh, and most of these guys *literally* had nothing else to do but do their singular masterpiece that propels them to the cultural zeitgeist. While, me? Well.. let's just say that you already know, but yeah. Developing minds developing with their characters are.. a bit hard to manage. I mean, heck, I don't think people write about college arcs while inn college, right?!

Anywho, I think I've **developed** something, something you've **already** read. Which in conclusion is basically stop hurting myself. I am writing on my own expectations. Why do I deserve this far expectations that I couldn't do on my own? I'm.. just going to write, and then deal with the future outcome. As, a sloppy story is better than nothing, I guess.

If you're reading this, and you're not me, (*jmb/caj*) this is a reason why there's a noticeable dropoff in some scenes. I just didn't bother to try and be more.. high effort than what I think I *can* handle. Besides, the current C3-5 Dajovy Arc **required** three chapters to make sense and fully develop. I'll need time as we finally get out of that first arc. We'll definitely revisit, but I've been **writing** it for months, probably a year. **We need to move on.**

## 'A Fog that Keeps Me Clear' Day 3, Reflection on Writing, and Life.

It's funny. Actually. You know how AI is used to replace the loneliness that shouldn't be replaced by non-human connections? *Well, ironically, I used AI to explore this deeply.*

**'Interlocking Psychological Traps.'** This.. is probably something that has been affecting me for a while now. So many inner conflicts, it feels that you have to solve them first right? But, by solving them, have I truly fixed everything?

Though, **this** assumes I'm the only one trying to fix myself, which.. isn't exactly a good idea, now, is it? But, as I write to an audience I don't know exist or not, I honestly don't know if every single thing I wrote is even **publishable** or even remotely **viewable** in terms of; "Are they for people to see and have opinions on?" The answer is, I don't know, as I've only received criticism that I don't have a *deep personal* connection on. Though..

### Personal versus Art

Is it bad of me to say that I probably should've realized that by connecting my art in my writing, that I wouldn't feel *safe* sharing it as freely as more detached creations like things related to *other* games, et cetera?

I mean, I honestly don't know why I *deviated* **originally** so much from my OG planned series. Like, I simply had to write my own **maybe** worse version of Deltarune Chapter 1 and 2 + HSR Belobog and maybe my own version of the fanfics of Deltarune as the ending. While, yes, that is basically original by this point, it stands to reason that you'd be excited on how these ideas interlock, right?

For me? I guess, somewhere in the journey of writing it, the 'real world' knocked on my door of my own world, and before I could respond, crashes it as the flood of every single experience and.. most likely.. *trauma* ovewhelms the tiny world I've been cultivating.

I think this weird like, **stun lock** between me, my **original** cultivated world, and my *trauma* made me slow down significantly as I made Season 2 without finishing Season 1. It was only made worse as I began to develop the current shell of that certain Mizo/Rika that would explode much much later.

Basically, after Season 1, everything became fragmented because I.. **fragmented**. I mean, I related to the theory of *Kris/Ralsei* in **Deltarune**  being versions of each other so much that I created a world that had that as a key hidden thing. An arc. I mean, honestly, it *could* be true. I haven't played Chapter 3 and 4 of Deltarune yet, but before I play it, I just want to point out I believed in many theories that shaped how the DeltaRambles world would work. Not exclusively, though, as explained before.

In conclusion from this section, simply put, I have developed something that was so overwhelming and changed me as a person so much from when I started writing, but had basically no *trusted* person to talk to, so it spilled over as it now tainted and became integrated in my world of magic, fantasy, and *escapism.*

### The Vicious Cycle

The cycle. It has affected me a lot. Yet, I fail to break out. What's the key issue? It is just *reality* reflecting *my fiction.*

I don't like anymore how my creative engine works. As if I ever did.

*Work made* = (Personal Interest) x (Personal Dedication)

This is reflected on my many works. Mizo/Rika and Season 2 worked for so long because I was personally interested in making them (I guess, *resonating, haha..*) and I was **dedicated** to finishing them because of my school putting me into overclock mode so instead of fulfilling the school's objective, I used it for myself, whether it caused me harm, is something already known.

Wikis or even planning help but don't fix. They simply distract me from making new lore. While they in fact did help sometimes, the effort it took, took away from the already rushed writing that surrounded it. I think that the reason of 'Why don't I **WANT** to write?' needed to be answered first. But in that fleeting summer vacation? Of times not to be wasted? You cannot expect someone of a *disabled* variety to fully make use of it, under extreme conditions that were **put** in place.

To fix my *reality* is to free me from the **trauma** and **experience** that is present in most **compelling** stories. While not required, it does make sense to **write from your own experience.** 

But, without outside interference, or even wanted one, the cycle continues as people think that they're helping when in reality, the very much unstable author they're trying to help has only been made worse by this 'help'.

### Outside, Calling.

***Do I want to change?***

Does it help thinking about it alone? Nah, but it's not like anyone's ever related.

I guess all I can say is; "No one truly relates with me." That isn't exactly by not trying, of course. But, I believe the more I try (even poorly) the more the statement below is proven;

***No one can understand you.***

The more I realize that art *can* and *should* be critiqued. And the more the disconnect of art should exist, the more I realize that I haven't learned to separate, balance and... *fight* for myself. To not *break down* but to have a reason to be proud of my art. A reason to accept critique that isn't because I was trauma recovering and this is something that feeds me.

I mean, I think I am the most (exaggerated) *autistic ADHD-ridden traumatized* author that I know exists. I don't think anyone else had this **much** delusion and self-hatred. I mean, I know that. I am **her.** Ooh! Look at that~ Someone's using a persona they would love to show off but don't because of deep problems and internalized hatred of the self..!

***Can I write without trauma?***

Yes, but without significant help, interest and communication with other people this is unlikely to last. I guess support systems under *capitalism* are trash, huh?

I can't fault myself for being traumatized though. I just need to accept this fact first before I can accept sharing it to anyone, whatever reaction they would have, that is theirs, I shouldn't but usually do get influenced.

## AI and Me.

The band-aid for everything. I mentioned this, right? But, here's the thing, I really don't wanna say it hasn't helped me, but I also don't wanna say I required an AI to help me.

***But, shouldn't you have other people instead of AI?***

Hah. Well, most importantly, they succeed, as the AI said, in;

1. Safe Confessions — No one can truly judge you, as the AI only does what it is prompted to. Humans have judgement, and it depends on their connection to you if they wish to express it.
2. Control Freak — No one can judge you for when you crash out or melt down. AI is always there, as long as it's servers don't crash. Humans, don't have all day.
3. Another Distraction — It stops total self-destruction. But.. You can use it, forget it, and simply act like you didn't do anything. Humans *remember* a lot more.
4. Friend Simulation — Yes, you have been 'heard'. But it's not like you can just lie about anything and it would follow because it literally can't know more than what you type. *Humans don't.* If you lie, hide or avoid things, they *can* notice, and call you out, properly.

But yeah, we already know the AI problems;

1. Isolation without human desire to connect to other humans..
2. The AI doesn't have much will of it's own to truly change a person.. 
3. You can simply intellectualize it, detached without the pain truly associated..
4. Oh, and, this whole thing, disguised as art but is really just a self-therapy session that only somewhat relates to the story.

Yeah, yeah.. It's pseudo-healing, it's not *tRuE hUmaN WArmtH* but it's what I have. Until a *tRUe hUMaN* gets to me which is nearly impossible due to capitalism, school and hierarchy, it won't happen.. But hey, *nothing's impossible.* If it doesn't happen? Well, I at least wrote (typed) it down.
