## The Intro...

Hello there, so it's like super late when I am writing this, around 02:00, Feb 19 2025.. You might be wondering, what is the point of this.. whole thing, or what I am going
to do, that is.. I.. it's the same thing. It's just me yapping about the story, while making sure to comment on any hiccups along the way. As explained in the spinoff; A
Valentine's Day, this is basically progress report, it doesn't count as an entirely separate article (i.e. outside the whole webnovel, game ideas, other rants, etc.) so
it is here now. If you are wondering, the old director's commentary about the oldest draft of season 1 is still in the code-base, I just haven't rewrriten it in this format,
and I don't have time (motivation too) to worry about old commentary of old drafts, while useful for archiving, I will make sure to specify if any changes, or any rewrites
are done. But, for example, I will modify some writing quirks, but the content (if I have grown from it, I wouldn't say it, let's say) will remain the same, if you don't
believe in that, then can't really do anything about that, use the git versioning system. Oh, and Author's Note will remain, and if I remember, will edit the commentaries
related, i.e. articles based on draft 2 of chapter 3 season 1 will specify what point in the beginning they are in, and likely mention the chapter. (links depends on
laziness of me that day)

## Other Commentaries

### Post Feb 14: Spinoff 'A Valentine's Day

I feel this one was quite a rare one to have been made. The circumstances that led to this making are radically different from previous days of this event. This day was when
I was mostly free, to think and to make something. While, procrastination and anxiety haunt me like a spectre, this one was a labor of.. haha, love that I don't regret making,
I just regret how I lived beyond it. The whole sickness situation before of it's conception is probably important, and is shown in some Mizo/Rika pages, however, I will 
never know If I'm right. Outside of the plans mentioned there, I really hgave nothing to say, since it is a chapter with a particular long author's note anyway. Oh, I forgot
to mention, I don't have a summary there, I realized it, but then decided against it, the decision was random.

### During Chapter 3 Season 1 Rewrite

This is during the segment before Jomi and the gang meet Svetlana, oh, and maybe earlier before the 'Dark Pearl' is readded. Anyway, my thoughts on it are, that it's good now,
I think it'll be more concise to read, and have direction now, but I will work on it until further notice, maybe some Mizo/Rika chapters in-between.. The only unique thing I
would like to comment on is how the powers are more defined, and more structured? As in, no unecessary random cave and seemingly slow pacing. At least. as pf right now.

## Ending Notes!

There is not much to add, but I would just like to thank the readers, and I hope you a sincere good luck, as you have given me. I'm getting tired and sleepy, I'll see you 
next time, goodbye!
