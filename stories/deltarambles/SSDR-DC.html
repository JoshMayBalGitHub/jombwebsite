DELTARAMBLES STUFF I NOTICED RANDOMLY BASICALLY INTERESTING THINGS I FOUND THAT ARE NOTABLE




***CHAPTER 1 SEASON 1***




1. Taglish

- I haven't used much taglish in writing, its weird, and the fact that i still unconciously dont is a sign of something that i should write down, since i really cant integrate well due to mainly two things: the darkners and the appropriateness of it.

- Because well, i haven't decided but its sure that the darkners are almost always speaking english, and i havent decided on whether it is because of how the dark world works something on magic like because of magic all darkners speak the same thing, but at the same time its complicated since this is based of deltarune and undertale lore where the dark worlds are simply creations of the rooms that they were created on. So the reason that they speak these respective languages are because the rooms or the person/s that created / exist in it (referring to lightners).

- The appropriateness of it also another consideration, maybe they could once or twice but i try to always speak trilingually or for these characters bilingually but then i would only appealing to filipinos educated on english and filipino (tagalog mostly). I always thought i should've used filipino as my main language instead of english but i came to terms that it's probably not a good idea, *yet*.


2. The miting de avance man.. it has been 1 years since i started.. how time files..


3. The project thing [1]

- It was a direct copy of a school's life which is the og work i did / base on after deciding to work on this DELTARAMBLES thing. It's called A School's Life, i should release a copy of it in my website so, keep that in mind, i think i will release soon, no edits btw, since that would just be a completely different story and i haven't finished this one lol.

[1] - Urda and Mijo meet up to do their project for school

4. This is where my 'writing' "improved" [2]

- From this chapter, because i used to not include more than he said this, that, and now i cautiously do this and with a bit more description than my barebones one. I kinda want to rewrite it but its a hassle and i am doing this project alone for now, and i would rather finish new and unfinished old ones than rework finished old ones.
I've also reworked this 2 times already so.. uh sorry if i made any mistakes, you're welcome to change it, but if you want it to change my canon, consult me.

[2] Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayon 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-"

5. This one was, well.. [3]

- If you know the dr and ut, you know what this is, based on that, and the whole thing, you can already tell that it somewhat follows the line, but it doesn't because I was a lazy writer when I wrote this (I still am) and I just wanted to make a short funny one for my friends.

[3] The lightners fell into a dark world at a school unexpectedly, those being the confident and talkative kid and the quiet emo-like kid.

6. Hold on, [4]

- Idk why i wrote it like this, by this point this Mijo is suppose to know or atleast likes sword based and sword deflection form, so why am i embarassed for not having a shield when I would've probably wrote something about me not using the shield since I almost always act like I only have a sword, and taking into account the magical world they just dropped into wouldn't it make sense that you can form magical shields so having a physical one is only if you want to? idk man, this characterization is weird.

[4] "... Yeah... my sword..." said Mijo embarassed.

7. This is an interesting thing, the honrato stuff

- In general, i just wonder why I introduced an honrato thing and never used ever since c2, you know what's the funny thing, c2 i think, is the most og one i have done, that's because while c1 is based off drc1, c3 the one i am working on, is based on hsr belobog, which if you play that game, you know that it basically copies almost the entire aspect of the city and the whole plot point, but adapting it to dr magic system (my own modification and interpretation of it). The honrato stuff makes sense since it is a room in a school, but what i take into my mind is the fact that it is only because i wish for a intense battle there and while that is being worked on c4s2, its a habit of my younger g8 self (I haven't changed much but the environment did).

8. I reference deltarune lol (runedelta in dialogue)

- You can tell I wanted to make a dr fanfic and I was reading a lot of them, but I also wanted to make oc's that would fit how I and my old classmates and friends would act.

9. The dialogue that follows the reference

- It's a reference to when I talked excessively and was obssessed with deltarune and undertale again during g8 after the former undertale craze I had before, where I talked about it with my friends, specifically this friend of mine, and it goes like how I wrote it between Urda and Mijo.

10. The implied time control of Urda

- It's definitely a way of implying the magic and her abilities which I am not as proud of but I will keep since this is fine, but I can't think of a better way, also this was when I was writing with my phone in the gymnasium of our school just staring at the digital clock on the top since the meeting de avance that was happening was kinda mind-numbing for me when it happened. Oh we were sat down on the ground for the whole time.

11. The "Game has been started" thing

- This I thought was a funny thing to add, but now has become lore important i think? idk i'll see what lore this comes out of since I hadn't made sense of it when I did it, nor did it repeat, i think in the following chapters.

12. During the skeleton fight scene

- I was proud of this one due to my sister's specific mention of it when i let her beta read it. I am still proud of it and use it to this day as a base for how characters should get magical power ups, it is explained in future chapters, and those reference this and the next ones which all follow life-or-death types or intense emotional / mental stress (like JR, or Rhida.)

- I also liked the characterization here and the dialogue, oof, i just really like writing these types of dialogue.

13. Genshin reference (Kahazu = Kazuha, Monshtat = Mondstadt)

- This is a reference to a friend of mine liking a certain character in genshin impact, i think anyway, because their former pfp was kazuha before switching to default then, their own. (this was in facebook so irl face because its needed for school)

- This was also when I got into Genshin because of her (the friend) and my sis so i said where I was when I wrote this part.

14. The *familiar* star..

- This is in reference to deltarune and undertale where there's a star that only specific people that can save see, and so this implies that they are in like in some sort of weird game since the meta elements show in these games but here, well, you'll see, this is probably related to the earlier game start thing.

15. The journey to Cab Castle

 - There was none, like honestly, what was I thinking? Atleast c2 had a miniboss, this just skipped straight to the boss, it didnt even happen on the game i based it on, since before the king fight there was atleast 1 miniboss and quite a lot of enemies and dialogue between the first save point in the first dark world (ie in the fields after going into it, leaving castle town) and the king fight.

16. The skeleton king (before fight thoughts)

- I didn't name this guy lol, if he ever comes back / referenced, he is referenced as the skeleton king, or king if I don't make another king character.

17. The purple lightning (originally white)

- Hold on, I changed this to purple now but before I haven't explained why I did in the story, but in the meta context of writing, I forgor, ok? I simply forgot that she (Jomi) originally used white lightning, and I didn't notice it when rewriting so... i don't know if i ever specified the color afterwards, but it definitely is meant to be purple now, but I haven't like explicitly, but if it was shown in a animated / irl form, it would be purple in c1 from the start. But what do you think, should it had stayed white? IDK, any discussion is appreciated.

18. The hooded figure (Jomi)

- I don't think I noticed on how I unhooded Jomi after c1, since well the character she was based on did unhood, but he did in the story during the chapter she was introduced (deltarune, ralsei). The reveal in c5 was supposed to be like the critical moment where the hidden Jomi finally revealed herself to Mijo but I am probably going to recontexualize that or change it a bit to make more sense after writing the previous ones.

19. Breathing very heavily

- I don't think I noticed how this statement is.. a weird way of describing like when you are.. well breathing heavily after a run or exercise hard, it should be something else but I just can't see something that fits all, and I try to use other words for it now, but it still definitely appears, i just.. find it odd.

20. The hooded figure's plan

- I was wondering why Jomi would do this, or why would Urda not trust her, but this is a classic case of misunderstanding, since well, Jomi was trying to get the lightners to experience the dark world more than her (at least that was my intent on describing) and Urda not trusting someone that throws their new teammates to the big bad boss, and them just dealing with the lowly minions.

21. King waits for the lightners to fight him

- This is interesting because I was wondering how would it make sense for the boss to stand right there while the lightners talked with Jomi on a plan and how the characters would react

22. The fight with King (and meeting Scopicro)

- This was pretty fast, idk why i quickly did this to introduce Scopicro, someone that I would never introduce again, since he.. honestly, i thought it would be interesting to put someone that like the secret boss in delarune would embody something (like the freedom motif), but I never expanded upon it since you get to the secret bosses if you did something special but i never did that and i wanted to complete this since there was a huge stretch of time in writing i just wanted to move on, so i did what you saw and.. disappointing but I could never integrate it to my story again.

23. *Game End* and the closing of the fountain

- The game end thing ties back to 11., where I talked about the lore implications and honestly, I'll just see what happens, since if left, could just be a weird thing i put for fun and if developed, could seriously shake the lore but.. i would prefer if it didn't turn out to be like meta ooh this is a game / novel you are stuck on since I would like to think that this is more of a alternate timeline where magic existed with a magic dr system.

- As for the closing of the fountain it is more just another reference to deltarune specifically but nothing changes, though i dont know if they seriously hear the music or not when they close the fountain, also the implication of a special one that can do this is comes to mind, and you'll see if i ever touch on why is Mijo always the one closing and not someone else.

24. "Boner" vs "Skelly"

- This is an inside joke for the people that were in that class, since there was a model skeleton that was there and eventually we got close to it and we named it but the names were different for each person you asked.

25. "12 uwian"

- This is referring to the beginning when I wrote that originally 12 was when they were supposed to go home but then the characaters got transported to the dark world so i had to made sure it made sense in that context by making up some excuse of trusting parents that wondered what their child did in those 5 hours after the teacher announced that their children are supposed to go home after 12. The implications of the dark world existing and the school and irl stuff are explained in the future chapters but basically, what is said in the story is what it is, if you apply irl stuff then it gets complicated.

- The complicated stuff, as i will explain now, is how on the earth has nobody outside of the characters i wrote cares about a completely new dark world that appeared, in deltarune it hasn't been explained yet but since that game isn't over yet, i can't definitely say how toby fox and his team deal with that, so for now, i just explain the things that i think would make the more relevant cut and leave the other things vague enough for the world to make sense.




***CHAPTER 2 SEASON 1***




Sidenote: This is an interesting thought i had and wrote about for quite a while its about the dynamic between Rhida and Mijo, this is more explained on their parts but i just wanna say i have a plan for Mijo to write a note, to Rhida for things, i will not say it, for this point, but i will probably do in their parts, i just wanted to say this at the end of c3 directors notes because its something i want to note about.

Sidesidenote: So i want to make a spinoff different persepectives focusing on things outside Jomi / Mijo so that things become interesting especially on the c4 and c3s2 parts. Like a note explaining the characters thoughts on a time skip like between the seasons.
