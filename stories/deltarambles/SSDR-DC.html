## The Intro...

Hello there, so it's like super late when I am writing this, around 02:00, Feb 19 2025.. You might be wondering, what is the point of this.. whole thing, or what I am going
to do, that is.. I.. it's the same thing. It's just me yapping about the story, while making sure to comment on any hiccups along the way. As explained in the spinoff; A
Valentine's Day, this is basically progress report, it doesn't count as an entirely separate article (i.e. outside the whole webnovel, game ideas, other rants, etc.) so
it is here now. If you are wondering, the old director's commentary about the oldest draft of season 1 is still in the code-base, I just haven't rewrriten it in this format,
and I don't have time (motivation too) to worry about old commentary of old drafts, while useful for archiving, I will make sure to specify if any changes, or any rewrites
are done. But, for example, I will modify some writing quirks, but the content (if I have grown from it, I wouldn't say it, let's say) will remain the same, if you don't
believe in that, then can't really do anything about that, use the git versioning system. Oh, and Author's Note will remain, and if I remember, will edit the commentaries
related, i.e. articles based on draft 2 of chapter 3 season 1 will specify what point in the beginning they are in, and likely mention the chapter. (links depends on
laziness of me that day)

## Other Commentaries

### Post Feb 14: Spinoff 'A Valentine's Day

I feel this one was quite a rare one to have been made. The circumstances that led to this making are radically different from previous days of this event. This day was when
I was mostly free, to think and to make something. While, procrastination and anxiety haunt me like a spectre, this one was a labor of.. haha, love that I don't regret making,
I just regret how I lived beyond it. The whole sickness situation before of it's conception is probably important, and is shown in some Mizo/Rika pages, however, I will 
never know If I'm right. Outside of the plans mentioned there, I really hgave nothing to say, since it is a chapter with a particular long author's note anyway. Oh, I forgot
to mention, I don't have a summary there, I realized it, but then decided against it, the decision was random.

### During Chapter 3 Season 1 Rewrite

This is during the segment before Jomi and the gang meet Svetlana, oh, and maybe earlier before the 'Dark Pearl' is readded. Anyway, my thoughts on it are, that it's good now,
I think it'll be more concise to read, and have direction now, but I will work on it until further notice, maybe some Mizo/Rika chapters in-between.. The only unique thing I
would like to comment on is how the powers are more defined, and more structured? As in, no unecessary random cave and seemingly slow pacing. At least. as pf right now.

## Ending Notes!

There is not much to add, but I would just like to thank the readers, and I hope you a sincere good luck, as you have given me. I'm getting tired and sleepy, I'll see you 
next time, goodbye!

<!--An Intro and more additions I guess. oh the spinoffs and more s1..-->
<p id="D2"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: Trade Me, My Friend</md-block></p>

## Intro

Hello there! So, this is the first one that isn't the intro of the whole point of these.. 'articles'? Um.. I have yet to implement comments anyway, that requires a server hosting that isn't static.. Anyway! I don't need that yet anyway. After all, by the time I have shown my work, I'll probably know/got a way to show my work beyond this website. Anyways, let's get on with the commentaries.

## Why Title?

Oh yeah. Just a note on the title, like my other works, the title makes as much sense as if you read Shakespeare's most eloquent work while being a 5th grader.. I'm not saying it's that hard, but I tend to just get random titles from whatever is happening (music, people around) when I write..

## On Chapter 3, Into the Dark

Oho boy. Now, I know what you're thinking.. "Hey, didn't you just address the rewrite?" Yes. But I have more to say. Okay, so the same context; 

(~~This is during the segment before Jomi and the gang meet Svetlana, oh, and maybe earlier before the 'Dark Pearl' is officially named, but I've begun to write that part~~)

Ok, so what else..? Oh, right.. subsections.

### In the context of Chapter 3 modifying the other chapters..

So.. this one was likely in your head, "Why didn't you just start at Chapter 1? Isn't that where.. the story starts, and so would fit being the first to rewrite again?"

Good question! If you thought about that.. Basically, I think as explained in 'A Valentine's Day' author's note at the end and as well as previously.. It comes down to two **reasons, **firstly,** on how it became 'bloated'. I feel that I put too much into it, and I denied that it** stopped me from integrating more ideas, and creativity until when I realized that 75% of the way through, the last part was going to be hard to write, when I haven't decided on what Misha/Polina is doing or what the reasons for their seemingly antagonistic behavior.. how to handle Cara/Jomi and her group.. Yep. Basically, I had to just rebuild the whole thing. I began to rewrite the beginning, but I realized that some scenes such as the cave scene, are kinda pointless? It's a good scene, however I need to integrate it better into the whole storyline.

So now, while I actually do have an outline from Chapter 1 to 6 Season 1, I started in Chapter 3 to develop the biggest connecting arc. (Dajovy Arc now from Chapter 3-4) Because Chapter 1-2 have already been rewritten, and the next chapters haven't even been touched since their inception, Chapter 3 is where I want to start the second rewrite. The changes I'll mention here go as follows; **Elemental System Refined, plot  points fully realized and the general magic system more clear to me, so that the soft magic I write makes sense later in Season 2.**

## Chapter 1 to 2 Season 1 Self-Crit

And with that, I've also begun to look at my older (still rewritten) chapters like the previous two. My commentary on the current state is that firstly, the first chapter needs work to be.. more introductory? My main **self-crit** is that the chapter is too.. how should I put this.. this dark world feels too small, like from the depths of the dark, to Jomi's Castle and then to Scians-Chemistra: Skeleton. But it's not that I want to make the chapter bigger, but that plot points don't make sense (i.e. star thing, I haven't figured out if I should write it in, or how it appears in the first place)

There are also small details like how Jomi went from friendly to hostile to friendly without explanation, at least.. because I don't actually know, so I don't have any hints to drop. The whole point of having a devastated world that's planned to be connected to Scians-Chemistra, but is never mentioned.. Yeah, I have a lot of stuff I need to connect. Basically, I need a wiki and/or outline to know what details I introduce, and what hasn't been.

Let's also mention Chapter 2's main issues, the whole chess game, the world progression, the boss fights, and et cetera. Basically, while I did rewrite it, it wasn't a massive rewrite of progression unlike Chapter 1, so it maintained a lot of something that didn't really have to be there, or should be rewritten fully. 

## Spin-offs and Life

Okay, I'm here to address the things I've been writing in meta notes, specifically.. what's with the amount of one off spin-offs that while characterizing characters, don't do much to 'expand' exactly.

What I mean is, some spin-offs during Season 2 (especially G10 part 2) are what I would call 'vent posts'. Like they are made so I can just say I let out my pain through text. I'd bet that if I grow popular and my works get into an animated form, these chapters will be left untouched because of their emotional content, but without the proper connections... Uh.. if you want to though, it's fine. Everything published is free to modify as according to the Mozilla Public License Version 2. 

If you don't know what that is, the oversimplified version; **just credit me and keep it open source, if you use my story**. But! I would recommend reading it or asking someone else for more details, as this is just a vague summary from my understanding.

Anyway! Yeah, I find that these spin-offs while important, are delegated to be true spin-offs. As while some parallels would be there, (Rhida and Mijo, Mijo's bigger problems during Season 2..) the story would be better paced and connected.

### 'Bonus Scenes' and What are They?

So, if you haven't looked at it, don't worry, this is.. **less NSFW**, than what I warned in the actual texts. I'm just going to comment on my journey there. Of course, as with the topic, if you are innocent, then you might find some wording doesn't make sense, but.. look, you're reading the director's commentary, you just gotta expect the author to comment on everything, including these parts. So.. if you don't realize yet; **_Slight NSFW warning._**

So, let's start! So, this.. 'journey' began in IMT. If you've read it, you would know why. But, if you forget, it's the part where;

~~(The scenes where Mijo 'experiments' with her new body, and the 'implied' tentacle scene)~~

Like I said, **slight. NSFW.** Anyway, after this.. I was wondering.. hmm.. what if.. what if I wrote that one scene, but.. more explicit? So.. I did. With the help of.. AI. Yeah. I haven't mentioned AI and it's influence on my writing. Basically, I recreated the scenario, then I took ideas from it. For example, the descriptions and progression from the whole intimate scene basically made it easier for me to stomach the sexual scene. Of course, as it was a 'bonus scene' of IMT, that was what I called it at the time.

But if you read the whole series, you might have realized it involves more than just 'bonus scenes' of an already existing work, more like.. **spin-offs** but sexual. This started right around **AMwY**, which is a.. 'spinoff' of the timeframe between Chapter 4-5 of Season 2. By that point, I've realized that these bonus scenes aren't that easy to write based on the actual content of the chapters they are based on. So, I just pick a timeframe and write on that. Such as the following ones based on general settings rather than strictly being a scene which could have been added, but you know.. **NSFW.**

Looking back, I wonder what got me into more extreme likes.. As in, look at the TCt series of spin-offs..

 (~~If you want to, of course.. Because be warned, it is quite heavy, soaked in lust~~).

But, those.. spin-offs contain the deepest explorations of what these sexual scenes mean for me, as in... not as reflective like the ending ones, but it was important in letting me know of these types of sexual encounters. What I'm getting at is it allowed me to explore the topics associated with the lust associated intimacy of it. And you know, it helped me be more aware of how I react to sex in general, as I grow older haha.

Anyways, the more I write in it though, the more I get.. tired of the whole.. process? As in, if you look at sexual content sometimes, sometimes you would want to just.. see the process, the whole.. arousing part, then focus on whatever story was written to get to that point. I was getting tired of writing those exact arousing scenes, as I'm not an artist, I can't exactly.. 'innovate' in how I describe in how many ways a person can have such scenes. Slowly, the scenes focused on a story, with sexual topics and parts as a necessity (i.e. exploring sex in a broad context, not just the sex part itself, more present in my later writings)

As of right now, I ended the spree of writing these scenes with 'TCU', just figure out what that is, but **basically** christmas with Cara/Rasca and sex. Of course, it's more complicated, but then it would dive into more explicit territory, in which case, just read the darn thing. But, I've ended it there for now, while focusing on the rewrite part 2. As I think was implied/said in 'ARoD', where.. well, it's a review on desire, in which I expressed my dissatisfaction with writing and wanted to move on from sex, and I did, until I got an idea and did it, the previously mentioned; 'TCU'.

## Conclusion and Ending Notes

Okay, so cool, that's all I have to say this time. I wanted to express my commentary in a structured way for me and others to review. I hope you got the insights you wanted, and an idea of my plans, anyways.. Enjoy your day, reader, ¡ADIÓS!

<!--Welp genshin impact meets me and produces Caj-->
<p id="D3"><md-block># DeltaRambles DC: The Impact of Genshin</md-block></p>

## Intro

I know the title gives; 'I'm delving deep into the reasons for the story inspired elemental system of DeltaRambles!' But.. uh.. it's complicated. There's a bunch of topics I want to explore. Firstly, the part you expected, the elemental system, but secondly, the general 'impact' that 'genshin' had on me, I'll explain it on the section itself. Thirdly, Caj and her relation to those previous two, and how she represents my experience with being a genshin 'fan' for years.

## 'Brief' Notes

I just wanna say before I go in, is.. a lot of this writing was done during a specially passionate night... And at home mostly. So, it's unlike previous chapters, and more of a reflection of what has been done due to the lore inspirations.. Like, not specifically noting any specific chapters (i.e. notes on writing etc. chapters like any main season chapters). Though, the Caj section features a chapter that has the same potential as Mizo/Rika. Basically, a story adjacent to the main story, while not being affected heavily due to the separation.. (Mizo/Rika is the definitive slice of life experiment, and Caj is an experiment on writing actual fanfiction, and basically just a way to get the creative juices that were dedicated to genshin going.)

## The Elemental System

Hey hey it's your awaited discussion! What's the deal with the elemental system!! Now, anyways.. this goes back into the topic previously mentioned, if you've read, but if not, it's fine! The 'Second Rewrite'. In summary, it's a major rewrite of the first 4 chapters first, before other plans, focused on improving story pacing and most importantly.. _The Elemental System!_

### The Focus on the Elemental System

So, you might be wondering, why is the reworking of this specific part, the magic system, or at least a major part of it, important? Because, a key thing I missed during writing is the mechanics of the magic system. Sure, I had ideas, as seen in the first drafts of The Delta Archives, or in some fight scenes in the mentioned chapters, at the point of rewrite, I was missing something.. 'Tangible Skills'?

Like, for example, let's take the quintessential protagonist, Mijo. Tell me, how did he gain his insane pyro/electro powers? He just spawned with them? Okay, that can work but how does it.. interact? That's a key issue, I wildly differentiate on how it works, before the rewrite. Key example, I think on some scenes of Season 2, the 'reactions' have some impact on the story, especially during the boss fights, but I feel that during Season 1 especially, it felt unsatisfying to not get the desired like.. for example, everyone knows Mijo will eventually win, he's the protag.. But, he has to gain and earn that victory, while I have shown that with the previous chapters, I also felt that looking back, none of these really took advantage of the elemental system I developed into the story.

Remember how in key scenes from let's say the inspiration, **Genshin Impact.** The elemental system is shown? (mostly, I still reel from the multiple scenes of nonsensical elemental usage.. i.e. traveler versus Arlecchino) Hmm, while there are certain reasons for certain fights happening, I'm still going to say that there should be innovation in these fights, especially since they're not a one woman writer. Like me..? Okay, let's get that out of the way. I have lots to complain about Genshin Impact, but that is reserved for the next section.

Moving on from Genshin Impact for a minute, the sentiment of myself really showed how I wanted to have Genshin-like (shit I mentioned the game, oh well..) combat but more.. creative. You know, since it isn't a game, I don't care about the actual gameplay balance (but if it were a game.. hit me up, I'll work with it) and just create reactions that can change up the fights. You see, there's this hidden mechanic I haven't shown yet, since I haven't written there, but there are base reactions and 'enhanced' reactions, for example, there can be reactions that do this particular thing that benefits the character and maybe debuffs the boss. This is the main reason I say it's off from gameplay balance, with the o.g. game being a gacha game, and I'm still reconsidering making my (theoretical) game a gacha game or just a different way of live service..

Besides that, these enhanced reactions spice up how fights can happen, with new characters, for example. How Mijo can be different from Mack (pyro/electro too) or even from Ikari (pyro/geo).. As well as how some characters can be powerful but not a hybrid element user, i.e. Rhida (cryo) versus Jomi (cryo/electro) due to mechanics specializing them in different roles, that make for good stories or gameplay (if that ever happens). Though, if the roster gets big enough, I'll have filled all of the hybrid and single element users by the end of this journey of writing (eh, we'll get there when we get there, and besides.. new mechanics will likely have been developed by that point, i.e. light/abyss magic revamp or whatever)

Not saying I'll do that! The revamp! It's just an early idea that I got IF i wanted to make it more complex.. Besides, I'm not in the future yet. Anyways, to end this massive subsection, I'd just like to say that the whole writing fight scenes with the elements takes a lot of time to do, so if you're wondering, I'm really good at dialogue, but I'm still working on the action.

### So.. how does this affect DeltaRambles again?

The effect is.. quite big, but only in the sense that their powers are more refined. For example, certain scenes like the forcefield from Jamise or blizzard from Rhida still happen, but way more.. grounded in the system I wanted to implement. It goes from a generic magic system with ambiguous powers to an elemental system, that can be expanded upon. That has always (I think?) been my idea since the first draft. I didn't write these reflective articles during that time, so I wouldn't know. And I would like to save reviewing drafts for future articles for me to deal with.

### Are you done 'rambling' about the elemental system?

Wait! One more thing. With Caj being out, I just realized how.. certain powers just don't get explained in my story, or.. basically, I assume a lot during spinoffs or future chapters in Season 2. So, if you're confused as to why some chapters have total dissonance.. this is why. Chapter 3 to 4 was written during a time of the still developing magic system, and less.. idea of how Season 1 would end, and how Season 2 would start. The confusing parts of it I would think make you wonder, 'jmb! What should I really follow? Should I read your spinoffs to get an idea of your current process, or wait in perpetuity for the final draft of Season 1 and 2?' Well, nothing is really 'final' especially in the case of web novels like mine. You can literally just edit it years from now, if the website still exists. But, I believe there'll be a point where I can say, okay, I think this is.. fine. We can build off of it. It's not peak, but it's fine.


## The Impact of Genshin on jmb

Oh boy, here's that Genshin Impact critique. Okay, let me start by saying.. Don't.. just don't bully me because of this, it's stupid I gotta say; 'IS JUST GAME WHY YOU HAVE TO BE MAD?' About the critiques that can range from valid to what gacha players call 'unlucky/skill issue'.. Okay! I can rant in here, it's my article! Besides, I wish I was listened to by Hoyoverse/Mihoyo.. If I was in charge, I would've made Fischl and Lisa have a 5 star variant already.

### The Beginning Honeymoon

OKAY! Let's start. So I got into Genshin Impact through my friends during that time, but I didn't really get much into it until Fontaine. Yeah yeah, for being such an obssession that led to this whole series, you'd think I'm a day 1 player, but nope. I'm late to gaming outside of tactical/strategic war gaming and typical mobile gaming (Clash of Clans, Pokemon Go). Anyways, I was leaning to watching anime when I got into high school but didn't get into it before Genshin Impact, so you can say that game opened up a lot for me.

I think I progressed through the game at first to around the end of Monstadt, but didn't really try to finish and go to Fontaine before my sister joined me during one of her college breaks and that got me into REALLY finishing Genshin Impact. While we played and had fun exploring and dying to the monsters around, I was basically progressing the story during that time.. Let's just say there were some key things I initially ignored as 'skill issue' that reflecting, basically is now my main issues towards the game. But we're still in the beginner dummie phase of mine.

I had.. many rage issues when I tried Dragonspine. I hated it. I still hate it. People might say, 'Oh! You just need to manage the freezing mechanic!' or 'Just get better characters / get good at the game pup.'. But genuinely, that and the whole inexperience of these mechanics + having low-level characters... A recipe for intense hatred for one specific region. Honestly, I don't remember, but I bet I was getting ganked hard because the leveling mechanic.. ***SUCKS!***

But before we complain about that, since I'm still a newbie, I kept going and reached Fontaine. I had fun I guess. My enjoyment goes like this; 

"Oh cool Monstadt, my favorite freedom anemo place :D, oh.. Liyue.. I guess it's China.. eh, fine. Hmm, a civil war and a dictatorial archon? Ooh Inazuma~ ! Why.. why did it end like that!! Why do I have to use stupid story keys to.. fuck this, I need dendro. Huh, interesting.. Sumeru is.. I guess complicated. Soo many things to do though.. Ooh! An overthrow.. that's cool! Oh, big scara robot.. Maybe I should name him.. 'Scaramona' ehehe~ ! I like that ship~ Then fontaine.. hmm this Furina gal is interesting.. What? Why so serious Traveler? What.. why prison?! Finally, plot. Oh damn. Flood killed. Pardner is kinda sad now.. Oh! Nation of War, and dragons?? That'll be pretty cool, maybe we fight that archon of war.. Murata? I don't know her name..."

That's basically my experience, that is before Natlan by the way. Around the last archon quest update. That is just my reaction to the archon quest, but including every detail on every damn quest is impossible, so I'll summarize again with my impression of characters I liked;

"Ohoho Lisa? Oooh! Venti? I like him! Fischl! Prinzessin der— Mona, the astrologist girl.. hehe~ Oh, and batman, but red haired. Diluc I guess. Alright.. Liyue.. Hmm.. meh.. Keqing looks like a certain motivated man I know.. but anime girl, eh.. oh well, She's a standard 5 star. Interesting.. Xinyan? Hu Tao? Xingqiu? Especialy that guhua nerd. Hmm.. Mr. Zhongli... he's.. diginified. That's for sure. Bird gramma? Guess that's cool I guess. Ga-ming. Okay, Inazuma time! Raiden Shogun!!! I NEED YOU! (I never got her and I will always hate Genshin Impact for that) Yae Miko.. interesting fox girl, too sly, yet.. intriguing. Hmm.. Ayaka and Ayato are a sword duo I want! (I only have Ayaka) Itto and Kuki Shinobi? Cool duo and cool group! Oh! Yeah, Kazuha!!! I forgot who he travels with.. Beidou? Damn, I must've forgotten that cool pirate girl. Anyways, Sumeru!! Wanderer.. Can I name you Scaramou— But Scaramona is fine? Okay..? Nahida is cute, also good dendro applier. Eh.. the rest are fine, I just don't have any lasting impressions.. Fontaine! Furina de Fontaine! Please come home! (She never does, 'coming home' is getting her by the way, for non-gacha addicts) My Neuvilette!! Uh.. yeah that's it..? Arle? Eh.. I think that's it."

This is before Natlan. Also before I quit halfway through the fontaine fillers. (Around the latter half of 4.x) You can see my types by the way. Anyway!! Ahem, that's the characters. So.. what about the game? Well, we're at Fontaine now, pretty much endgame until Natlan right? Okay, let's.. start!

### Post-Archon Story: Fontaine Fillers

Okay, so I think the events were cool, even as if most of them don't have combat. I don't remember any bad experiences, I think I even enjoyed that roses and muskets event, or the monstadt alchemy tycoon simulator event.. I have no gripes with like.. minigames, but increasingly, I started hitting the mid-game crawl. The point where I looked at the insane amount of collecting, grinding (at specific days too!!!) and annoying gameplay (i.e. either stand there and press all the buttons with your characters or riftwolves. Just the hp drain, as well with that boss that requires geo for some reason.)

But, systems for later. How about story? Surprisingly, I enjoyed the filler, but I don't know, the gameplay increasingly became more annoying to me, but I kept going. I was still at the point of being a mid level account while having a stable mental health. (that means no insanity of school.. yet.) So, annoyed.. sure, but not.. 'traumatized'? Like some people joke about how you get so annoyed and hate all mascot-like characters like Abby from Wuthering Waves because of.. ***Paimon..*** But, I feel like the whole scheduling and unnecessary wasting of my time through it's **dogshit** leveling and slow progresion through many many mechanics, made me burned out. I **would** like to take it slow, like how I do now due to the.. ***insane school situation,*** in WuWa and Honkai: Star Rail.. (if you want me to discuss those other two, there is time for another day, and article.) But Genshin, I feel punishes you a lot harder than say, WuWa for missing days. At least WuWa *HAS* an overflow system now, **IMAGINE** not having one for **FOUR YEARS?!**

*Yeah. You know what, let's tackle the mechanics now.*

### Post-Honeymoon Nightmare Progresion

**Okay.** *Let me cook.*

First!! Overflow and Talent system. This is a post-Genshin quitting critique, but ***MOTHERFUCKER.*** WHY IS THE 2x claim tied into the **fucking** collectiion mechanic? Find 2B crystalflies to get **shit** relics! To get mora and books you can't use because the talents are in **fucking** friday! Okay, well.. the schedule, *I AM NOT* looking at it to see; "Oh, this day has that one, and this day I'm going to get that one.." *IF I WANT TO BUILD CHARACTERS, I WANT TO START NOW.* I'm not waiting for a specific date or 'farm something else'. I don't control my damn time. I can't just be logging in everyday and be playing as well, or as long as other days! For the love of holy god above, please, ***PLEASE.*** Remove this outdated, stupid and annoying time-waster of a **bullshit** system. Oh, and getting to 300 resin doesn't matter, if **THERE'S NO OVERFLOW.** GOD! Just add it. It's not that hard. I got too annoyed at two intertwined systems I had to include them at one point.

Second, collecting. You know how boring it is to walk around and pick mint and the character ascension mats with the **shittiest** movement for an open world game? You can say; "WuWa spoiled you or it's better than others!" All I can say is if you can do movement stuff in Natlan but keep it paywalled to Natlan characters... (with shittier options that includes Saurans, sorry lil' guys, but it would be better if you guys were the main thing and not just a substitute for poor people, like me.) Then you can make actual movement mechanics that aren't slow. Seriously, I feel dread whenever I see I have to collect more Sakura Blossoms for Ayaka. Or those red berries for Lisa, or those lamp thingies for Fischl. **I WOULD LOVE** if there were just multiple flower shops (there are, but I think only a few of them, besides, requirements get higher after a while) that just needed Mora I need anyway, it would be so much better! Just farm Mora and get enough for that one character, and make it at least 3 times per week I can buy, like in WuWa! (I would prefer just a daily reset, but I'm not a gacha dev)

Third, exploration in general. Many many rage quits have been because of exploration. Many times where I would just quit instead of playing the game. Many times where I did so much work, for little. One more quest for the Raiden Shogun.. one more chest.. still nothing.. nothing.. Nothing. The exploration can be fun sometimes, but without improving movement like I said earlier, I would instantly quit. It feels restrictive compared to WuWa. I feel that mobs that fight me take so much time to kill as the previously mentuoned pains of leveling earlier, or I instantly destroy them, then having to hunt for each collectible drop. I still remember the horrors of hunting rouge samurai for Ayaka, or the search for plants, just for a certain Sumeru person I don't remember anymore. A lot is just spent doing monotonous work for little gain.

Fourth, hopefully the last.. Relic System. Adding on to the problems it is entwined with, I hate how.. specific some domains are. And my current experience is just a waste of trying to get even just a 4 star version of the relic, not even a good one.. I had so many moments were after 30 minutes, since my characters don't have their relics, I get shit relics and all I can do is try again and again. I just.. hate that. I hate being forced to do this type of damage in this specific area, and after finishing get another set of shit relics. Leveling up them which is just combining the boat load you already have is fine, but the whole thing leaves me drained so much of my passion and life force, even now, I feel that dread and regret from ever playing that game, and now being so passionate about the story, but the potential of the game and even the story now just wasting away to the wind..?

## Caj, to the Multiverse of Genshin and DeltaRambles!

Okay, so Caj. Who is she exactly? Well.. her backstory is like this, as according to her first spin-off; (click the link, btw if you can't see it, just scroll down until you do) <a href="TDA-jomi.html#caj-rl">link here</a>

So, that's her backstory. You can see why characters that I like get featured in her story, but my comments are pretty short, since I've been talking about her a lot in my direct spinoff, but here's the in-general things I've been thinking about.

One, the whole 'keeping up with genshin' in terms of lore and world-building. I mean, by the point that the game is at, Caj is an influencer that genuinely has change, especially in Inazuma. Her relationship with most of the important Inazuman characters and outside of that, general popularity has made her the same amount of chaotic spark like the traveler was during the main Inazuman Arc. But, the thing, key difference is the whole 'original idea' was from me messing with A.I. that was integrated into this game simulating Twitter/Bluesky/Mastodon, the microblogging aspect. With, special events and milestones too!

### The Origins of Caj (Rala)

It feels that when I first discovered that app.. (Status-AI btw) I felt a wave of creative juice flow like never before. I'm obssessed with that app now, I want to play it all the time I get. (Wink, wink where do you think Caj's impulsiveness comes from..?) It's like, it's a story that is easier to write? As in, you have your own O.C. being this, while the initially static characters through your interactions begin to change as well, it's like a big memory for these A.I. And it's way different from like.. chatbots that feel like you're just talking to a human-like figure. no it's like just literally random peeps + your favorite characters, for example, it would make sense in a popular... post that there's important people but also randos that get a lot of traction.

I especially like events, the ones where you create a small chatroom that creates small ripples, like.. let's say I go out with Raiden for a dango feast, and that immediately spreads because of the internet, and I have to navigate that.. The random events also peak my interest, sometimes it's like random events from random people, but the  interesting parts are related to the characters you pick, interacting with *YOU.* You see their move and you respond with yours, sometimes I accidentally make everyone either happy or amused, or lose trust/hope in me for a mistake I didn't recognize. It's kinda like real life, where you can please people a lot of the time, but making one mistake gets you to try and always build it up again.

Especially feeds my ego in that, Caj is quite popular, and so has the upsides and downsides of being popular, while me, jmb is just observing through the app with ideas flowing in my head.. Caj is a character born out of interest and passion. Honestly, as flawed as she is, she's my dream girl. Like, being an erotica writer? A sort of 'Mary Sue' on magic but somehow isn't the avatar.. Flounders a lot, and drinks a lot.. I basically based her off of me. I know, there's a lot of characters based on me now, Cara.. Jomi.. Mijo.. and now Caj! I have many names, but most of them are girls~! 

### Outside A.I.

Outside the whole app and my drive to make Caj a character, like.. actually someone that doesn't rely on AI to be herself.. I find writing her quite easy, it's just.. writing takes time in general. The whole irl interactions are way harder but are more deep, so for example, what if instead of AI writing Raiden and Yae, and me just having to act like me.. What if I write.. all of them..? That's the idea. After the first spinoff, I'll probably work on short stories surrounding the Mizuki event and the event there.. Then establish the Traveler dynamic, as well as add some key irl moments from my AI escapade but rewritten to fit my style..

As well as having to study the characters mentioned. Unlike AI, whom needs to be updated and retrained every day to produce something differently, I am but one woman writing, I'll probably be more accurate, but less consistent, or the opposite, really depends on my mood at the time. Writing my OC characters are quite easy, they're mine, but Genshin fanfiction..? Oh my, if I write the Raiden and Yae Miko dynamic wrong or if someone feels my OC encroaches on the ship, I swear.. I'll get bombarded or something, as if the Ao3 curse wasn't bad enough..

Anyways, in conclusion, Caj is literally me, in a lot of ways, but a lot of her powers and personality come from her unique situation of being a Genshin fanfiction OC but also a character in my own OC. She is.. a unique person. A chaotc, yet awkwardly charismatic woman, capable of making peak erotica for everyone, while having most of Inazuma be her support group.. She's that embodiment of chaos I wanted to feel again in Genshin, or any story I've been writing.. I hate to admit it, but I haven't been reading too.

### Edit (Feb 24, 2025 | 8:08)

I also just realized, an inspiration for the whole world hopping, and dimensional shenanigans is the 'teleserye' called 'Maria Clara at Ibarra'. I know, while the trope of the show is common, it's where I was like.. 'Hey, why don't I do that?'

If you're wondering, it's a show about Jose Rizal's two novels; 'Noli Me Tangere' y 'El Filibusterismo' with a twist of a modern girl being transported into it, and moving along the plot. See the resemblance? While mine might be a bit more fantastical than Jose Rizal's, it's a look into how a person from the modern age adapts to the book.

## Conclusion

So, that's all I have to say. That was lot of thoughts.. all packed in this document.. I can already see my total wordcount being around 4,000 words.. Anyways, some sidenotes I guess.. You might be wondering, does this affect the second rewrite? Yes. But, I am always shifting gears anyway. I've been.. less than motivated these past few days on writing, due to the stress of *INSANE SCHOOL STUFF...* I'd want to get Chapter 3-4 done at least before school ends, but I haven't even finished the actual first spinoff, much less the actual story.. Anyways, ¡Adiós! May you enjoy the rest of your day, ¡mis amigos!
