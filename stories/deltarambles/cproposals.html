## Idea 1: 
A dance happens in the school and Mijo and Urda by "fate" get matched up, since their friends all have their partners, and they know each other so they go to the dance but like something like this okkk???

Mijo goes to party says Hey Urda nice dress!

Urda says the same about the suit

Both of them get a lil attracted but they brush it off cause their friends

They dance to the romantic music and immediately turn to them with jamise and/or lauvielle shouting the most lovey dovey things you coulf think of and they get embarrassed and talk about it there.

After the dance, both are like messed up with messy everything and like talk about friends and yadda both play games see thr show yadda that type of fluff lol

Then like their friends come up to them let say Jamise and Leviente and say like Oooo, ya like Urda / Mijo? Both of them deny but they dont know that like they secretly / don't know themselves that they like the other after that they both interact as the dance calms down and people are in their friendgroup. Its fun!

## Idea 2:
Like new section or something and by coincidence all major characters in story are back with new faces or removing some... Depends really. But like this time they're experts that bring newbies to the dark world where once again a villain strikes? Maybe like multiplayer matches or something, like the other classmates that got separated from the main group go to the dark world somewhere? Since a room cant be used now maybe like they have to keep moving but they accidentally release or motivate the villain and i think like it will contrast on who's who and how things rhyme? In school maybe? Season 2?

## Idea 3:
Mijo like is alone, waiting for his parents to come pick him up then suddenly darkness erupts from their room / any room really complab 2 and he has to go in there without his friends, to... Save the world?

## Idea 4
So like there's a chapter where they're like Mijo and friends chilling in breaktime/lunch until suddenly the room next to their classroom is blasted with darkness could be any, preferably the empty ones. Like instead of seeing the aftermath, like the whole darkness like spreading and impact and they watch as they can't do anything? Or maybe? Idk

## Idea 5
So like what if Mijo and maybe others others are optional but like what if in the school it rains and it floods and one of the dark worlds are flooded so after surviving a flood he goes home, only to find that, its still raining and there is a flood and have to fight rain monsters or something and when they get back they're wet lol

## Idea 6
Maybe like when Mijo or Mijo with some friends was walking near a school building that was scheduled to be demolished and they see a dark world created inside the soon to be demolished building and it starts like a big adventure where the building is like a huge desert with small towns that are sparsely populated with a couple of people, telling then stories of a once great world turned into rubble as natural causes and wars caused its downfall and its really sad and once they get out they either try to save them or hope that the new building that will be constructed will better them?

## Idea 7
What if like one of the characters of the dr universe like separates with the main group (someone new but hasnt been introduced yet?)
Like mayhe after the reunion they leave to like a different school to encounter different people and dark worlds and they come out as a changed person??

## Idea 8
So basically imagine season 2  but more developed like lauvielle getting in, new characters joining, dynamics changing yada yada you know it i basically want to have a continuation of what i did in chapter 1<h2>Last Updated: August 29, 2023 || 11:13 PM / 23:13 (Philippines)</h2>
