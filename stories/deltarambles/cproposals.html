## Idea 1: 
A dance happens in the school and Mijo and Urda by "fate" get matched up, since their friends all have their partners, and they know each other so they go to the dance but like something 
like this okkk???

Mijo goes to party says Hey Urda nice dress!

Urda says the same about the suit

Both of them get a lil attracted but they brush it off cause their friends

They dance to the romantic music and immediately turn to them with jamise and/or lauvielle shouting the most lovey dovey things you coulf think of and they get embarrassed and talk about
it there.

After the dance, both are like messed up with messy everything and like talk about friends and yadda both play games see thr show yadda that type of fluff lol

Then like their friends come up to them let say Jamise and Leviente and say like Oooo, ya like Urda / Mijo? Both of them deny but they dont know that like they secretly / don't know 
themselves that they like the other after that they both interact as the dance calms down and people are in their friendgroup. Its fun!

## Idea 2:
Like new section or something and by coincidence all major characters in story are back with new faces or removing some... Depends really. But like this time they're experts that bring 
newbies to the dark world where once again a villain strikes? Maybe like multiplayer matches or something, like the other classmates that got separated from the main group go to the dark
world somewhere? Since a room cant be used now maybe like they have to keep moving but they accidentally release or motivate the villain and i think like it will contrast on who's who 
and how things rhyme? In school maybe? Season 2?

## Idea 3:
Mijo like is alone, waiting for his parents to come pick him up then suddenly darkness erupts from their room and he has to go in there without his friends, to... Save the world?
