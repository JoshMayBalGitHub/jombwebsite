## Idea 1: Intro to Kultima

I actually want to explore the world, system and governance of Kultima at it's different time periods but I don't have time for that in the story so I'll briefly explain.

There's like a situation of communist monarchy military junta going on right? Where Jomi is the queen of Kultima and Dajovy, but where Anastasia and Sasha are the two right hand women of her, so it's basically just Svetlana but replaced. It's just Jomi is bigger or something.

I just wanna know how it works!!! But it'd be too complicated to actually integrate into any story. I'd ideally want to focus on fantasy magic and like, JJK/Chainsaw Man type character-focused action than like, collective action or something, as yes, that can work but I want to explore characters more and I find it more interesting.

---

### Idea 3: Powerup Pins!

Temporarily use a character's very being with their power and appearance using their drawn anime-style pin! I dunno. It'd be cool. Maybe it depends how the user resonates with the pin, the catch is you'll lose it.

(Idea #2)

---

### Alt. Titles

HoFun's Start 

The Week Before The Rumbling (?)

Tests of Abyssal Cracks

### Timeline

February 23 to 27 (2026), exploring outside the main characters. Like, the Intramurals about Sean and Ashley

Day 1 (Feb 23) - Mijo arrives to chill as the perspective shifts whenever he's bored. This is the Dark Pearl - Vesalius Section is most prominent.

Day 2 (Feb 24) - Late Mijo to an early perilous day only to calm down. This is where Sean Group + Leukya is most prominent.

Day 3 (Feb 25) - Mijo attends a Dajovy Spanish Lesson to appreciate Spanish Day. This is where Charisu Group is most prominent, + Mijuo and Arvile. Leviente shows up here.

Day 4 (Feb 26) - Mijo arrives early but finds little annoyances along the way. This is where Ashley (and her group) briefly appears, but focus on Dom Pez and Mijo interacting with 'Dark Pearl - V' and 'Sean Group'.

Day 5 (Feb 27) - This is where an invasion happens, but it seems to be for show, as the characters converge. Rhida shows up.

---

### Characters

Sean - explore more of their feelings towards the dysphoric disconnect between their light and dark world forms, improve 'Triggered Explosions'.

Ashley - cameo so she actually does something (I haven't found a way to introduce her so drag her back as a Mijo affiliate, maybe implication that she still went to the dark world but didn't have the games so is less experienced?)

Laire - explore her briefly, being one of the antagonists, her character and why she looks like the way she is (art-obsessed self-confident gal with a bit of an ego but still humbled after the Vesalius showdown)

Dom Pez - explore him briefly, maybe with a Mijo scene to emphasize the character appearing here, maybe a little taste of him without challenging THE lightbringer 

Leukya - explore his background of photojournalism and computer science, his personality of chaotic eclectic electrical action, and maybe a brief clash with the other boys (Dom, Sean) Oh and he brings a large briefcase of guitars and wifi that are weapon and support, respectively

Mijuo and Arvile - These two are basically together so I'm putting them here. Explore why they're different and stuff, and their powers. I don't have much to say just enough so they're not cardboard characters

'Charisu Group' - ft. Charisu, Gabi, Lena, Celine

Since these four are together... a lot, maybe briefly show dynamics but basically don't focus too much, Charisu maybe to Ikari, Gabi to.. Mijuo, and Celine to Seya (introduce briefly but minor character), and Lena uhh.. I dunno actually, maybe Arvile but we'll see.

'Sean Group' - Sean, Kurona, Natie, Bela

Sean is already more.. important, but let's explore their dynamic to the other three. Sean and Katie, then Kurona and Bela. But beyond that, basically just Sean and the others, as their background.

'Dark Pearl - Vesalius Section' - Mijo, Lauvielle, Ikari, Cassie, Ayena, maybe Laire after the Showdown

Mijo won't be the focus.. as he's the focus for most of the Main, but he appears as the anchor point every day. Explore why exactly Mijo is distant when Lauvielle, Ikari and Cassie and Ayena do stuff together, light and dark world. Laire joins in, as the group splits, Mijo going alone most of the time, then Lauvielle, Ikari and Cassie. Then Laire and Ayena. But, yeah.

Leviente and Rhida - cameos, but mostly absent as it occurs in Honrato High

---

<p id="ID3"><md-block># Between Vesalius' Incidents</md-block></p>

## Brief Explanation 

(Idea #4)

So, I found this draft buried in the Chapter 5 Season 3 File, and realized it was Chapter 8 before my vision changed. Now, this could be turned into a spinoff maybe, but since my original vision has changed, I'm going to put the OG here. This has no title, but the given title I gave it currently explains the timeline, somewhere around January 21-23, 2026.

um darkphone is cellphone, okay~

_Honrato High. 12:00_

"Oh boy.." Mijo was walking at the second floor of Perez Building, the old hallway reminding him of his G10 era, and Rhida. "We used to chat a lot here huh?" Mijo had his backpack with him as he looked to his left, seeing the windows and doors leading to his old classrooms he used to look at everyday at this school. "Man, such a shame I can't bring her here a lot nowadays.." Mijo looked down and mumbled, "Unless I want to provoke the questions of why, what and when.." Mijo was about to enter his classroom and opened it to a dark world inside, the smoke coming outside of it. "Huh. Again?" Mijo takes a deep breath. "Let's go." He readies himself, then jumps in.

(insert intro scene here where Mijo meets like civies or something something Lightbringer Legacy)

---

(skips to the scene where Mijo meets Urda)

`"Someone is behind me."` Mijo turns around. "Who are—" Urda slides towards Mijo. "URDA!" Mijo hugs her, as she hugs back. "Eyy!! Captain!" greeted Urda as Mijo pulled back, chuckling. Mijo greeted back, "Yeah, it's.. been a while, huh?" Urda nodded. "Mhm. Let's get outta here before those people arrive again." Mijo tilted his head to the left. "Huh? How?" Urda grinned. "Magic! Like.. we always do." Mijo nodded furiously. "I—I know, like—" People approach around them. "Ah! Here. Hold on to me." Urda held out her hand. Mijo asked, "What—How?" Urda grabbed Mijo's right hand, making him gasp. "No time!" Urda then summoned her pistol, that had a new grapple hook ammo as she fired it and the two went higher as they landed on invisible ground and slid, as sparkling golden dust appeared from their shoes scraping the ground. "Wha..?" Mijo was looking at the ground as Urda fired her pistol as they went higher then lower by attaching to the air. "Something I learnt. Um, just.. hold on to me, alright?" Urda focused, but was blushing slightly.

"Hey! Why are you—?" Mijo noticed it anyway, anxious of where Urda is going. "AH! WHAA—" Urda shook her head. "Nothing! I.. was just a bit.. heated? It's kinda.." Urda leaned her head to the right. "..hot? I DON'T KNOW! It just feels weird, trust." Urda uses her pistol to grapple upwards. "Y—You have a GF, and we're kinda.. um, separate." Urda slides down as Mijo follows her. "Anyway, we're here! My base!" Urda looks at Mijo, smiling. "It's fun, eh?" Mijo nods, as they headed in to a rundown, yet somewhat livable concrete box of a house. "Found it abandoned. Used some uh.. magic to.. y'know, y—you get it. It's just some basic invisibility stuff." The two lay down on the floor. "Ugh.. could be worse." commmented Mijo, as Urda nodded. "Yeah.. arrived like um.." Urda looked at her darkphone. "..an hour earlier, didn't get to do much."

"So, what was that about?" Mijo looked at Urda, who looked away. "The whole, uh.. panic thing." Urda was speechless before sighing, and looking at Mijo. "I just.. haven't spoken to you in a while I guess. One-on-one." Urda sighs. "Like, we saved the world last time," Urda hummed in reflection. "or maybe just your section but.." Urda groaned in disappointment. "..yeah, I.. just want to speak to you more. And, uhh... talk, explore and.. fight with you, on our own adventures sometime." Urda put her hands to her face, her voice muffled. "I got it now and I panicked with that opportunity, and I just.." Urda dropped her hands to her sides. "..sorry, haha.. I didn't mean to scare you like that, I know how you feel about love, bro."

"..I don't even know if I want it, honestly." said Mijo, as he slumps over at the wall. "It's been distressing to keep up with friendships lately, due to me, still BEING a procrastination expert." Mijo sighs. "..love? Me and Rhida try, but it's long distance now. We have different goals in life, and.. I'm busy in-n-out the dark world, so.." Mijo hums in regret. "..we don't have new memories to talk about together. It's.. almost been a year since she left Honrato." Urda looks around her as she stands up. "Man, you're depressing." Urda approached Mijo. "Still.. we need to find the dark fountain." Mijo nods, standing up and facing Urda. "Yeah, agreed." Urda looks at his face before saying, "Looks like we need to talk a lot more.." Mijo shrugged. "I do just need to talk to more people. But, I don't know if it's because I look busy, or people are repelled by me." Urda laughed. "Well, in the dark world... We're both just introverts drifting between groups."

(Insert Ikari here)

<!--maybe spinoff universe but idk i just wanted to write the fractsidus lol —jmb!!-->
<p id="ID4"><md-block># Cristoforo & Fractsidus Cameo</md-block></p>

## Brief Intro

(Idea #5)

So, of course they're not going to name them exactly like that if I ever adapt and use this but for now, I'll use a shorthand, you'll see.

Reason is, I want to actually show the villains winning, but I haven't cared about the story since Rinascita's completion, oh, and Phrolova joins in as well.

## Brief Description (of Appearance)

### Criso (Cristoforo)

[His Description](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Cristoforo#Appearance)

### 'Scar'

[His Description](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Scar#Physical_Description)

### Roliva (Phrolova)

[Her Description](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Phrolova/Backstory#Appearance)

(Editor's Note: Find their descriptions at their wikis, I redacted their text because I directly copied it from the wiki and you should check them out~)

Lycoris radiata, red spider lily.

### Lady Ascilla

Ascilla is wearing a short black coat dress, underneath is a white sweater that turns red from the sternum down. A red, near-transparent fabric that represents vines wraps around her arm loosetly, flowing behind her in the front and back. She wears black gloves with silver nails, and her right hand is adorned with two rings, each on her thumb and forefinger. Her leg garter, which is on her right thigh, has a red camellia flower in the middle. She also sports a pair of short black boots with red soles and short, white leg warmers with the same flower as seen on her thigh garter.

She has white hair with pink highlights all over. On the left side of her head she has a black, four-petaled flower accessory as well as two small silver hair clips. On her right ear is the same camellia flower earring but in dark red. She is wielding a black semi-transparent umbrella

---

Criso walks over a field of flowers as he bows to Ascilla. "Lady Ascilla, I have humbly gone to you as a request to help me and my organization, evolve them to.. beyond humanity~!" Scar waves at Ascilla, who is currently tending to her flowers. "We hear you help worlds in turmoil if it interests you. Trust us! It's fun. Especially with Rai (Rover) around. Hey, maybe you two can talk about the world?" Ascilla looks at the two and raises an eyebrow. "Hm? Where's **The Conductor?**" asked Ascilla as the two look at each other before Scar said, "Leader let her go after fulfilling their deal. You won't be seeing her with us anytime soon.."

Ascilla opens her umbrella as she looks at the card portal the two came from. "It seems I've been noticed for my descension." Ascilla looks at the two. "Let's ask **The Conductor** for her opinion." Ascilla goes through Scar's portal as the other two follow. Even though Scar's portal is controlled by him, Ascilla managed to seize the destination and teleport to a Sonoro Sphere someone lingers..

_The Lost Beyond.._

Roliva immediately turned around as she saw the three. "Lady Ascilla." Roliva looked at the two behind her. "You two. Why are you here?" asked Roliva as Scar answered, "Why not? Don't worry, me and Playwright here aren't recruiting you back," Scar smirked. "We just wanna know what the lady intends to ask."

"Roliva.." Ascilla opens her right palm as she blooms a red spider lily as Roliva gasps but keeps fixated on it. "What do you think of this world?" Roliva looks up at Ascilla. "The Lost Beyond, or.. Solaris?" asked Roliva, as Ascilla gave the lily to Roliva silently. "I'll.. find a way to bring them back, merging.." Roliva trails off. "You.. we have walked and talked plentifully. Why ask again?" Ascilla smiles. "What if I give you it?"

Roliva is silent before asking, "Is it that easy?" Ascilla turns around as she and Roliva walk, while the other two hang back to listen. "I've mused about it. The problem's, hm.." Ascilla summons a red-black ice jellyfish. "Where exactly do you want this world to stand? Will they be able to face and live out their lives? Does this require sustained ma—resonance?" Roliva nodded. "All these questions will be answered and solved with enough power. Are you asking me if I truly want this?" Ascilla shook her head. "I'm asking if you can fight the world~"

The other two widen their eyes in interest.

"Black Shores, Huanglong.. Rinascita.." Ascilla lists. "They're all part of the anti-Lament Alliance, no? To merge consciousness with tacet discords to.. resurrect life.." Ascilla walks as she sees Roliva think deeply. "That is a wish I want to fulfill.. But, before that.." Ascilla looks at the two behind her. "Let us cooperate, but not integrate. I'm interested in helping, however, I shall act on my own accords. The agreement we'll have is to not step on each other and work against a common enemy. Got that, boys?"

Scar nods as Criso adds, "Ah, I see what this is. You're.. quite interesting, my Lady. Me and Scar will head back and report." Scar shrugged. "Hey, as long as we win." The two leave. 

"Now, where were we?"
