## Idea 1: 
A dance happens in the school and Mijo and Urda by "fate" get matched up, since their friends all have their partners, and they know each other so they go to the dance but like something like this okkk???

Mijo goes to party says Hey Urda nice dress!

Urda says the same about the suit

Both of them get a lil attracted but they brush it off cause their friends

They dance to the romantic music and immediately turn to them with jamise and/or lauvielle shouting the most lovey dovey things you coulf think of and they get embarrassed and talk about it there.

After the dance, both are like messed up with messy everything and like talk about friends and yadda both play games see thr show yadda that type of fluff lol

Then like their friends come up to them let say Jamise and Leviente and say like Oooo, ya like Urda / Mijo? Both of them deny but they dont know that like they secretly / don't know themselves that they like the other after that they both interact as the dance calms down and people are in their friendgroup. Its fun!

## Idea 2:
Like new section or something and by coincidence all major characters in story are back with new faces or removing some... Depends really. But like this time they're experts that bring newbies to the dark world where once again a villain strikes? Maybe like multiplayer matches or something, like the other classmates that got separated from the main group go to the dark world somewhere? Since a room cant be used now maybe like they have to keep moving but they accidentally release or motivate the villain and i think like it will contrast on who's who and how things rhyme? In school maybe? Season 2?

## Idea 3:
Mijo like is alone, waiting for his parents to come pick him up then suddenly darkness erupts from their room / any room really complab 2 and he has to go in there without his friends, to... Save the world?

## Idea 4
So like there's a chapter where they're like Mijo and friends chilling in breaktime/lunch until suddenly the room next to their classroom is blasted with darkness could be any, preferably the empty ones. Like instead of seeing the aftermath, like the whole darkness like spreading and impact and they watch as they can't do anything? Or maybe? Idk

## Idea 5
So like what if Mijo and maybe others others are optional but like what if in the school it rains and it floods and one of the dark worlds are flooded so after surviving a flood he goes home, only to find that, its still raining and there is a flood and have to fight rain monsters or something and when they get back they're wet lol

## Idea 6
Maybe like when Mijo or Mijo with some friends was walking near a school building that was scheduled to be demolished and they see a dark world created inside the soon to be demolished building and it starts like a big adventure where the building is like a huge desert with small towns that are sparsely populated with a couple of people, telling then stories of a once great world turned into rubble as natural causes and wars caused its downfall and its really sad and once they get out they either try to save them or hope that the new building that will be constructed will better them?

## Idea 7
What if like one of the characters of the dr universe like separates with the main group (someone new but hasnt been introduced yet?)
Like mayhe after the reunion they leave to like a different school to encounter different people and dark worlds and they come out as a changed person??

## Idea 8
So basically imagine season 2  but more developed like lauvielle getting in, new characters joining, dynamics changing yada yada you know it i basically want to have a continuation of what i did in chapter 1

## Idea 9
Portal out of whiteboard markers

## Idea 10
You get string / rope attach it to a rock, boom! Weapon! Also teachers day dark world. Maybe massive people line

## Idea 11
In Season 2, Hypothetically, lets say that Leviente is trying to move on from Lauvielle, but things happen and now they are back, but its been tough, parents and all of that, miscommunication, all that 'fun' drama that comes with romantic relationship

## Idea 12
What if when you close your eyes and start to imagine like a dark world, where they fight enemies deemed relevant to the season

## Idea 13
What if something like this happens:

"Well you did it, Mijo.." jomi

"Yeah, wait let me just do an experiment* mijo

So like when a dark world closes, jomi is the pink notebook right? But what if...

"Hey, why did you- hey, don't you drag me to the light world..." Jomi

"I will" mijo

So like a scuffle happens but like mijo eventually wins and when the dark world closes
"Mijo!!!" Jomi as she runs to Mijo and holds his uniform.

"What did you do!!!" jomi

"Huh, so dark worlders can be here as long as I drag then to the light world?" Mijo

"Unfortunately yes, for as long as there is an equivalent, for example, skeletons will probably be just model skeletons but any human-type darkners will have.. this effect." jomi

"Unfortunately?! This is cool~ i can do so many things with this new knowledge!" mijo

"Ugh, since i can't create dark worlds, the only way i can go back is if some lightner does it or anyone can." Jomi

"Ok so first off, why do you... Look like me but girl?" mijo

"That's because.. i am!" jomi

"Hey mijo uh why did the dark world close- hey! Who are you?" Urda

"I am... Ugh, mijo you do it." Jomi

"Uh so she is, jomi but in the light world. Don't worry I'll explain" mijo

End for now?

## Idea 14
A Particular Annoying Encounter

"Ok, Mijo, we're here, at the subac zoo." said Jomi, looking at the towering building and an iron door which has a device screen in the middle.

"Hmm, what's this?" said Mijo, looking at the device that has a puzzle on it, waiting to be solved.

"That's a puzzle, I am sure you'll enjoy it, so I am just gonna look around for chests to loot so enjoy!" said Jomi, with a grin on her face as she leaves.

"Hey, can't you steal stuff here?" said Mijo, as he sees Jomi dissapear quickly from his view.

"Ugh, ok. Fine. Let's open this door, which has a puzzle on it, hold on, what is this puzzle anyway..?" questioned Mijo to himself as he inspects the device further.

The puzzle is a dance puzzle in which you must master a specific number and order of steps and do them perfectly. It is a social dance in which two people are required.

"Ugh, these types? WHERE is she anyway?" said Mijo as he looked around the area.

"Hi! I just finished my exploring, i found some loot, anyways what are you doing still outside the zoo?"

_NOT FINISHED_

## Idea 15
Something like major character damage or something idk. Like Rhida, or Mijo. Or Urda. Even Lauvielle or Leviente. Something has to happen

## Idea 16
What if Mijo and Jomi were accidentally switched gender and had to use magic to disguise their appearance, the clothes stay the same with one exception, for Mijo, his glasses and for Jomi, her crown hair clip. I wanna think about how they feel from before, during and after.
