    <h1>CProposals</h1>
<md-block>
## Idea 1: 
A dance happens in the school and Mijo and Urda by "fate" get matched up, since their friends all have their partners, and they know each other so they go to the dance but like something like this okkk???

Mijo goes to party says Hey Urda nice dress!

Urda says the same about the suit

Both of them get a lil attracted but they brush it off cause their friends

They dance to the romantic music and immediately turn to them with jamise and/or lauvielle shouting the most lovey dovey things you coulf think of and they get embarrassed and talk about it there.

After the dance, both are like messed up with messy everything and like talk about friends and yadda both play games see thr show yadda that type of fluff lol

Then like their friends come up to them let say Jamise and Leviente and say like Oooo, ya like Urda / Mijo? Both of them deny but they dont know that like they secretly / don't know themselves that they like the other after that they both interact as the dance calms down and people are in their friendgroup. Its fun!

## Idea 2:
Like new section or something and by coincidence all major characters in story are back with new faces or removing some... Depends really. But like this time they're experts that bring newbies to the dark world where once again a villain strikes? Maybe like multiplayer matches or something, like the other classmates that got separated from the main group go to the dark world somewhere? Since a room cant be used now maybe like they have to keep moving but they accidentally release or motivate the villain and i think like it will contrast on who's who and how things rhyme? In school maybe? Season 2?

## Idea 3:
Mijo like is alone, waiting for his parents to come pick him up then suddenly darkness erupts from their room / any room really complab 2 and he has to go in there without his friends, to... Save the world?

## Idea 4
So like there's a chapter where they're like Mijo and friends chilling in breaktime/lunch until suddenly the room next to their classroom is blasted with darkness could be any, preferably the empty ones. Like instead of seeing the aftermath, like the whole darkness like spreading and impact and they watch as they can't do anything? Or maybe? Idk

## Idea 5
So like what if Mijo and maybe others others are optional but like what if in the school it rains and it floods and one of the dark worlds are flooded so after surviving a flood he goes home, only to find that, its still raining and there is a flood and have to fight rain monsters or something and when they get back they're wet lol

## Idea 6
Maybe like when Mijo or Mijo with some friends was walking near a school building that was scheduled to be demolished and they see a dark world created inside the soon to be demolished building and it starts like a big adventure where the building is like a huge desert with small towns that are sparsely populated with a couple of people, telling then stories of a once great world turned into rubble as natural causes and wars caused its downfall and its really sad and once they get out they either try to save them or hope that the new building that will be constructed will better them?

## Idea 7
What if like one of the characters of the dr universe like separates with the main group (someone new but hasnt been introduced yet?)
Like mayhe after the reunion they leave to like a different school to encounter different people and dark worlds and they come out as a changed person??

## Idea 8
So basically imagine season 2  but more developed like lauvielle getting in, new characters joining, dynamics changing yada yada you know it i basically want to have a continuation of what i did in chapter 1

## Idea 9
Portal out of whiteboard markers

## Idea 10
You get string / rope attach it to a rock, boom! Weapon! Also teachers day dark world. Maybe massive people line

## Idea 11
In Season 2, Hypothetically, lets say that Leviente is trying to move on from Lauvielle, but things happen and now they are back, but its been tough, parents and all of that, miscommunication, all that 'fun' drama that comes with romantic relationship

## Idea 12
What if when you close your eyes and start to imagine like a dark world, where they fight enemies deemed relevant to the season

## Idea 13
What if something like this happens:

"Well you did it, Mijo.." jomi

"Yeah, wait let me just do an experiment* mijo

So like when a dark world closes, jomi is the pink notebook right? But what if...

"Hey, why did you- hey, don't you drag me to the light world..." Jomi

"I will" mijo

So like a scuffle happens but like mijo eventually wins and when the dark world closes
"Mijo!!!" Jomi as she runs to Mijo and holds his uniform.

"What did you do!!!" jomi

"Huh, so dark worlders can be here as long as I drag then to the light world?" Mijo

"Unfortunately yes, for as long as there is an equivalent, for example, skeletons will probably be just model skeletons but any human-type darkners will have.. this effect." jomi

"Unfortunately?! This is cool~ i can do so many things with this new knowledge!" mijo

"Ugh, since i can't create dark worlds, the only way i can go back is if some lightner does it or anyone can." Jomi

"Ok so first off, why do you... Look like me but girl?" mijo

"That's because.. i am!" jomi

"Hey mijo uh why did the dark world close- hey! Who are you?" Urda

"I am... Ugh, mijo you do it." Jomi

"Uh so she is, jomi but in the light world. Don't worry I'll explain" mijo

End for now?

## Idea 14
A Particular Annoying Encounter

"Ok, Mijo, we're here, at the subac zoo." said Jomi, looking at the towering building and an iron door which has a device screen in the middle.

"Hmm, what's this?" said Mijo, looking at the device that has a puzzle on it, waiting to be solved.

"That's a puzzle, I am sure you'll enjoy it, so I am just gonna look around for chests to loot so enjoy!" said Jomi, with a grin on her face as she leaves.

"Hey, can't you steal stuff here?" said Mijo, as he sees Jomi dissapear quickly from his view.

"Ugh, ok. Fine. Let's open this door, which has a puzzle on it, hold on, what is this puzzle anyway..?" questioned Mijo to himself as he inspects the device further.

The puzzle is a dance puzzle in which you must master a specific number and order of steps and do them perfectly. It is a social dance in which two people are required.

"Ugh, these types? WHERE is she anyway?" said Mijo as he looked around the area.

"Hi! I just finished my exploring, i found some loot, anyways what are you doing still outside the zoo?"

ok so since i don't have time to finish this i am just gonna say they initially hate it until they become good and master it enjoying their time until it's done and they feel empty but they move on.

## Idea 15
Something like major character damage or something idk. Like Rhida, or Mijo. Or Urda. Even Lauvielle or Leviente. Something has to happen

## Idea 16
What if Mijo and Jomi were accidentally switched gender and had to use magic to disguise their appearance, the clothes stay the same with one exception, for Mijo, his glasses and for Jomi, her crown hair clip. I wanna think about how they feel from before, during and after.

## Idea 17
Ok, so you know HSR, like honkai star rail? If you played that recently, you'll recognize some concepts there that I put here, so..

It's like season 2, after the climax at s1, the abyss doctor begins doubting that his plan of dark enveloping light, isn't gonna work, so he turns to the other worlds for inspiration, til he finds the 'dream' concept in the computer world  part 2, so he helps them and in exchange he researches their plans and tech, but he gets away with the plans as the world is freed from the unending pleasure, he decides to use the plan to trap the lightners in the unending dream.

But first he regains his power, and then tests the power during the intramurals, before going underground to prepare for the dream, after agitating and confusing Jomi of course, then after the students night, he secretly executes his plan, causing the lightners to fall asleep in an endless dark world, as they continue into a world that they see, everything going perfect for them, as the abyss takes over the lightners, trapping them. The lightners in the dream, supposedly discover and defeat the abyss doctor, but it's nothing more than and everybody wins and all is good, happy and orderly dream.

All goes according to the plan of the abyss doctor but he made a critical mistake, in managing a huge dream, he can't keep the desires of the lightners from getting too ambitious, causing contradictions. So Mijo sees something wrong, something that is a contradiction, Jomi starts to integrate more and more into the light world, something she would never do, after he realizes this, he sees how the things he took for granted or the things that the dismissed as just coincidence become things that start to detach him from the dream, as he does this, he wakes up.

In the students night party area, but everyone is like in a trance, he walks around until he sees Jomi, then Urda, they conclude that it's like an area between reality and the collective dream, since the things that they saw during the computer part 2 world, to confirm this they go to the main area in the dance floor to see Rhida. Rhida is looking at the people, and sees the three, and they meet up and figure out what to do, then JR, and Ikari show up and they talk. 

They devise a plan to escape by using Ikari's fiery will to break through the dream and try to wake from there, while Jomi and Rhida stay behind to guide the people out from the dream, as Urda and Mijo, use their time and reality breaking powers to break the dream itself then they meet up with the others to fight the abyss doctor again, but for real, and this time, in his final form.

All goes again, then they fight the abyss doctor, and after debating and fighting, he realizes that by maintaining the dream he also trapped himself in one, as due to the use of abyss and light power, he is significantly weakened, but still managed to hold on, using the last to appeal to the light before getting defeated. As he falls back to the abyss, he wonders if he can ever win, as he realizes that he is stuck as the dark, the abyss, remains as the death and destruction against the light. But his story is for s3 as he disappears to the view of the lightners again.

## Idea 18

**_Spoilers for S1, S2 basically read my fiction first as it is basically that_**

So like I have an idea on like s3 / c4-6s1 plot and it's about family, tradition and continuing bloodline. 

Like C4-6 will explore that and it will lead to like diba sa **_BURY THE LIGHT_** by Casey Edwards there like "i am reclaimer of my name, born in place, I have been blessed, my _family_ crest is a demon of death"

So imagine that but like ok, so Mijo after defeating the supreme guardian of dajovy (i plan her to die? maybe.. you'll see.) but after he does that they say goodbye to the darkners and they go out of the dark world after a day and 16 hours and of course this isn't normal but since the exams are coming and jomi now an even more suspicious and dubious figure , they were trying to recover first, and we will focus more on that as it leads to c5 and c6 i think jomi and mijo should fight. it leads to it and yeah that's it?

*The end?*

## Idea 19

 So there's like a spinoff where Mijo one school day like before Ikari's birthday has an ai that like he developed so that he can simulate dialogue and intelligence, places with more immersion. 

But like after using it, one afternoon, he gets addicted to it, and eventually falls addicted as that's all he does now. 

At bed he thinks of new scenarios, goes to school and develops scenarios, he neglects to update it and maintain it properly due to his constant use of it, breaking immersion a bit. So he is obsessed with solving bugs outside the dark world while using it inside. 

The others notice this, especially his new gf Rhida, as well as Ikari and Jomi who hang out nearby and usually interact with Mijo, before he falls too deep. So they work through their own issues and vulnerabilities to try and solve Mijo'a issue why he did this and their own internal conflict about his creation.

Eventually they enter his creation, with Lauvielle in tow, as they see the depravity and the constant barrage of everything that AI has to offer from happy fluff that just has him interact with fictional characters, to hardcore horniness filled with intense and rough battles. They go through it, seeing how they can be affected by their own preferences. Eventually, they enter where Mijo was.

Mijo was dominating his fictional AI, and as the others saw him do the most horrible stuff you can imagine, they tried to stop him, but since they are in his world, he simply traps them into their own AI-made fantasies before they can even realize.

Eventually they break out due to the AI of their worlds being terrible due to the data constantly recycling itself until they finally find Mijo again, now dressed up like a certain Cara. They try to fight him, eventually Jomi gets to him and she is trapped as Mijo puts each of them in cages. As they lose hope again, another Mijo appears out of nowhere as he looks at the dark Mijo.

He stops the dark Mijo, making him still as he frees the others one by one, as he tells them that he was going to disable it but needed more time to do so and only now he got something to destroy it, so he does and they are back outside.

Mijo has a moment, then they express concern as Mijo shakes it off before they go their separate ways. Mijo goes back to his machine and begins reworking it, to be a sort of boss machine that integrates c3s2 stuff to use them in training. Urda and him try it. 

*The end?*

## Idea 20
So, I haven't finalized C5S2 but it's gonna go something like this:
It's hard to write worlds when you're being pulled by your school on all fronts of schoolwork so here's a vague summary and idea of it
(this is after the other Jomi realization)
so after Mijo walks out of the tent he talks to the guards and says he's leaving and he does so as he goes to a nearby forest with his sword and after a while, 

He finds his Jomi so they go to other Jomi and I have 2 ideas, either they fight to the death to see who's going to remain or they're going to merge, either way they're going to be one again, and Jomi is now the leader of the rebels and her kingdom. So, after this, they decide to call it quits and somehow Mijo gets out (?) since Idk i feel like multi-day dark worlds with this mechanic since it's post-S1 dark world shenanigans and maybe he only really meets his friends in the world and it's like a videogame? 

Idk, but the mechanic change is that the lightners are way farther from each other due to the mechanic change, idk how to explain it that's why I am stuck in writing.


Anyways what should happen is he keeps progressing and eventually meets all his old friends back and they band together somehow to beat the queen, since the lightners are still not trusted by the kingdom, however the conflict is that they disagree afterwards and this leads to multiple setbacks and it results in a lot of issues culminating in during the first quarter exam, like a civil war in the revolution, this eventually is resolved and Mijo somehow wins. This transitions to the stuff that happens during quarter 2 like the cool events, maybe another intermission chapter in C6? idk it depends, then C7 is the end of the Dark Pearl Arc with goodbyes and stuff.
