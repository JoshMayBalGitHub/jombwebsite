## Idea 1: Intro to Kultima

I actually want to explore the world, system and governance of Kultima at it's different time periods but I don't have time for that in the story so I'll briefly explain.

There's like a situation of communist monarchy military junta going on right? Where Jomi is the queen of Kultima and Dajovy, but where Anastasia and Sasha are the two right hand women of her, so it's basically just Svetlana but replaced. It's just Jomi is bigger or something.

I just wanna know how it works!!! But it'd be too complicated to actually integrate into any story. I'd ideally want to focus on fantasy magic and like, JJK/Chainsaw Man type character-focused action than like, collective action or something, as yes, that can work but I want to explore characters more and I find it more interesting.
