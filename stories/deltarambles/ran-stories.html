    # U DeltaRambles: Love and War

    Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:
