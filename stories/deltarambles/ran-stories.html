Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:

Leviente dirst

Summary: 

Author's Note: A student kills every darkner in the dark world lol. Also no relation to Canon Mijo btw.

Mijo wakes up after falling into a dark world in the classroom, he sees his student uniform worn down, and only a revolver with around enough ammo to survive for a day or so. 

Mijo said, "Ah shit, I'm screwed. I only have a revolver, at yun lang. Sana makakita ako ng ibang tao..."

So he got up and walked.. At first the darkness was... calming but soon it turned into dread as sound everywhere of something. Then he saw a huge field, filled with computer setups that have cabinets. 

He jumped down there and immediately a monster started attacking him and so he shot it but the monster relented. Mijo was knocked and hit a bunch of the setups, he kept shooting at the monster, but he was eventually knocked down and was about to die until...

Jamise shouted, "Hey! Get away from my Friend!!!" before shooting the monster and the monster decided to chase her instead.

Mijo was so hurt that he began to drift away to unconsciousness until a certain voice called out to him.

Urda said, "Yo, don't die on me Mijo, aalis tayo dito kasama ang lahat, yun yung sinabi ni Jamise sakin.." then she healed him. 

Barely enough that Mijo can walk because her magic was exhausted as well.

Mijo said, "Thanks. Jamise would do that huh, well we should go. Gusto ko din umalis bro.."

So Mijo got up and walked with Urda towards Jamise where she was fighting with the monster.

Jamise shouted, "Mamatay ka!! Putang inang halimaw!" before shooting the monster until it was dead.

'Hey,

"I am staying here. You don't have a clue on
how the Light World works." said Mijo.

"I'm just saying, you can survive the light world right?" said Jomi.

"No. The Light world sucks, it just is." said Mijo.

"Mijo, I'm concerned with what you are thinking about here, isn't the light world fun too?" said Jomi.

"You know, why I'm here, but incase you haven't thought much about it, I AM DONE WITH LIFE ON THE LIGHT WORLD. SCHOOL, hurts. The STRESS AND PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW- I WANNA ENJOY the world here." said Mijo.

"But Mijo, please, just let her go by closing the portal." said Jomi.

"No, NO! She can go off on her own, that's fine, you CAN teach her right? Just let her go then. I will be staying here. For the future." said Mijo.

"Well, Mijo, it will be unfavorable to both of you, if you guys get separated in the worlds, trust me." said Jomi.

"I Guess, but I dont wanna go back out there, where problems are way harder, just staying here is good enough for me." said Mijo.

"I understand, but this isn't your world. You belong there, its like with me but in the light world. You can have as much fun as you want here but you have to go back, don't you have friends to talk to?" said Jomi.

"I... do. But they don't need me. They do fine on their own, i wanna stay here. Even if that means forever locking the lithium room." said Mijo.

"I... can't let you do that, I'm.. you and you are me, you know this isn't right." said Jomi.

"Well, then I will just have to go out myself." said Mijo before drawing his sword.

"Look, i don't wanna fight but if you want to... i can." said Jomi before drawing her sword.

"OK OK LETS DO THIS!!!" said Mijo before attacking.

They fought but eventually Jomi was defeated with a surprise scabbard to the stomach.

"Hah... That was fun. But I have to go, to new areas. Good luck! I know you'll survive, and I'll meet you again!" said Mijo, before walking away, towards the gate that leads to the grass outside.

"Jomi!" shouted Ikari, from the fountain room.

"Are you fine? Are you ok?" said Ikari, worried.

"I'm fine, i have healing powers. Just go after him, before he does something rash." said Jomi pointing to her hand with a green glow.

"UH, are you sure I can take him, I mean you got defeated right here!" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I don't know. Find. Out. I can't really get you out of here without him, so... Good Luck?"
said Jomi, clearly having her fingers crossed.

"Uh, sige, mamatay naman din ako anyway, uh sasama ka ba?" said Ikari.

"Soon. I guess you can fight hanggang makapunta ako." said Jomi.

"Ok... See ya'!" said Ikari before going to the same door that Mijo went.

<!--Attempt at Fight Scene-->
<p id="R4"><md-block># Random DR Fight</md-block></p>

One day, in the Playas Cemetery....

"I... don't know what to say, honestly.." said Mijo.

"Yeah, guess so, but you can get the advice of our dead family over here." said Jomi.

"What? But I have my parents right there!" said Mijo, pointing to his parents.

"Can they even see me?" said Jomi.

"Oh definitely, I just said that you were a friend in school that also went here." said Mijo.

"Right, and they won't notice the... similarities?" said Jomi.

"Think so, i'll just say it's a coincidence, and besides, no one will look that far unless they're my friends..." said Mijo.

"Ok... and they won't notice how I have no parents or where they even are???" said Jomi.

"Relax... We're here to talk about life and.. Her. Don't worry, I gooot this. If I need help, I'll ask you, ok?" said Mijo.

"Alright, alright, I don't trust you, but you are the only one that can do anything about that, anyways, so-" said Jomi,

Before a large dark fountain opened right in the center of the cemetery, Mijo and Jomi quickly rushed to see what was happening, but got sucked into the dark world before seeing the fountain opener. They landed at the part where the fountain was, but it was basically the cemetery but dark, so off they go exploring again.

"Ah shit, didn't got time to-" said Mijo.

"Ok, relax Mijo, it's just a dark world, the only thing we need to do is quickly close it, so nothing significant happens." said Jomi.

"Good point, but if the fountain isn't here then..." said Mijo, thinking then he said, "Maybe..." before getting cut off by Jomi.

"Oh, its right there!" Jomi points to the fountain near where they were just talking in the light world.

"Sweet, it's one of those easy ones." said Mijo.

They quickly rushed to the fountain and as Mijo was closing it, someone blasted Mijo away from the fountain.

"Oof, sino ka!" said Mijo as he gets up.

"Hahaha... What's up!" said someone.

"Wait, you are... Cajo!" said Jomi.

"Who the fuck is Cajo?" said Mijo.

"Let me introduce myself, so you know how those dark fountains open without you? That's me!" said Cajo.

"What? No, that was Doctor G and Cara right?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, and I work with them, I opened those, not them." said Cajo.

"Ok... Who are you, lightner? darkner? Just who are you exactly?" said Mijo.

"Oh, uh... I come from nowhere!" said Cajo.

"Really, you can't even say where you even come from?" said Jomi.

"WHAT? Do you know me?" said Cajo.

"Well actually yes, you are Cajo, the lightner that was dissatisfied... I guess you got broken out by those two..." said Jomi.

"Oh, OH! YOU... You. Ikaw ah... Papatayin ko kita ngayon!!" said Cajo.

"Nope, not on my watch." said Mijo.

"Ok, Mijo. LET'S DANCE!" said Cajo.

<p id="R5"><md-block># C5S2 Scattered Ideas</md-block></p>

Ok so its basically just my ideas and suggestions for dialogues because I can't figure out how to connect these together properly

*Scenario 1: Rhida and Mijo Post-BSBH, during C5S2*

Mijo and Rhida are left alone in the tent, as Jomi says she has to plan and prepare a lot for the future battle. "So, I have to go.. Um, uh.. you two. Stay cool, ok?" Jomi smiles and leaves.

"So.. how has life been?" said Mijo, as he and Rhida are the most far away they can be inside a tent. "It's fine.. you..?" responded Rhida, with a dismissive tone. "It's been.. rough, to be honest. But, I am sure you probably don't want to hear about it.." answered Mijo, as the tent went silent for a while.

"Well.. what do you think of the dark world here..? It's another huge change from the old ones.." asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about her answer. "It's different.. I guess.. But..." answered Rhida, before trailing off and stopped talking.

"But..? But what..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida pondered the question. "But.. I don't feel excited.. nor.. scared. Just.. I literally don't have anything to say about it." continued Rhida, as the tent went silent once again, with only the sound of the lightbulb and electric fan nearby keeping the room from being totally silent.

"I.. don't know either.." said Mijo, as he looks at her, unsure of what to think or say. "When this is all over, we'll go back to before, again. It's the final school year.. of this era.." continued Mijo, reflecting on the past 3 years.

"Before..? I am more afraid of what might change afterwards.. At least, before..." responded Rhida, stopping herself before finishing her words. "I.. get it. *sigh* I just.. have a lot of thoughts.. I've been thinking about the future, and the past a lot these days in the dark world.." said Mijo, as he looked away, a bit worried.

"Nothing to do..? I mean, don't you have a lot of responsibilities here?" questioned Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her question. "Well.. yes.. but, I don't really have a.. choice when I think about it, it's just.. you know a lot of preparation and logistics are needed so, I often drift off looking at the night sky, while waiting for news and stuff.. Mmm.. Even.. nevermind." answered Mijo, before standing up. "That reminds me, we should go to Jomi." said Mijo, more montone as Rhida stood up and they went out of the tent.

*Scenario 2: Rhida and Mijo are paired by Jomi in some random mission using a new device she prepared (for them but they don't know that)*

"So, here's the device, it's my.. all new Chalo! It's a voice-to-text chat log, so just enable it and it should record and put it into text for logging. Good luck!" said Jomi, as she left to do more rebel leader work, giving it to Mijo.

"Hey! Why did.. you.." Mijo tried to call out, but Jomi was already gone. "Well.. we're already here.. right Rhida?"

"Yeah..? But, I don't get it.. She hasn't even told me about that.. So, I assume it's for your eyes..? But.. she did invite me here and left, so.. I can only assume she wanted me to stay here?" Rhida thought out loud, as Mijo was using the device.

"Hmm.. Oh, it has a note on the back of the screen." Mijo noticed a sticky note on the back of the chat log screen, with black ink:

'In case I forget, go to Mijo's tent or something ;)'

"My tent..? What.. oh whatever.. Let's go Rhida." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they headed to Mijo's tent and entered it as they sat down with the machine.

"Activating Protocol Number 69, smug smiley face." said the robotic voice as it starts trapping them in the tent with magic, then starts releasing a small gas payload that quickly fills up the tent.

"W—what.. is this..?" Rhida is a bit hazy, as she feels warm for no reason. "Oh fudge.. What's.. what the fudge is this..?" Mijo feels something rising and it's not just heat.

"Ah.. Um.." Rhida is shaking as she looks at the screen, the robot's message being displayed as well as what she just said. "Wait.. this.. isn't.." Mijo gasped and looked at the screen, displaying a smug smile. "No.. this is.. an aphrodisiac.."

"What..? What?!! Aphrodisiac..? What.. why..? Please explain.." said Rhida, she tried to cool herself down with a nearby electric fan, but she remained bothered by her feelings. "It's.. basically to increase.. a certain arousal.." explained Mijo, as he fiddled with the machine.

"A—arousal?! What?! What did she.. want us to do..? We're still teens.. we haven't done it.. But, it's getting harder and harder.. to resist.. Please.." Rhida says as she attempts to leave but her arousal is too much so she doesn't move much.

Mijo tried to use his electrical magic but due to his haziness he was unable to materialize anything as Rhida tried the same with her ice magic to cool herself down, also failing. "Ok.. Plan B.. Maybe.. just maybe.." Mijo says before Rhida looks at him, wanting. "Yeah? I know what you're thinking.." Rhida approaches Mijo, and their faces are now close to each other, then after looking at each other for a while, they share a passionate kiss.

They pull back, and look at each other again. "First kiss..?" asked Mijo as Rhida shook her head. "No actually.. but.. it's.. good to share it with you, is it.. your first?"

"Well, with anyone outside my family.. Yeah, It's.. I guess, weird hah?" Mijo comments as Rhida caresses his torso. "Not really.." Rhida looks at Mijo, unsure of what to do. "What.. I don't want to do anything you don't want, Rhida.. Even in this.. haze." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at him putting up a smile.

"Thanks.. Let's just.." said Rhida, before Mijo kissed Rhida's forehead, making her gasp. "I am sorry.. I just had to, I'd never—"

"It's fine.. d—don't.. we both know we're very.. vulnerable right now.." interrupted Rhida, looking up at Mijo with a flustered expression. Mijo only looked at Rhida for a short while before kissing Rhida again, but this time even more deeper and passionate. They make out for a while before pulling back.

"That was.. intense." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded while looking at each other, still very flustered. "I wonder.. what It'll take for this moment to.. well.. It doesn't matter.. Let's make this last before we regret anything." continued Mijo, as they made out again.

They pulled back after a while and Rhida said,  "I know we shouldn't.. but.. I am so tempted to have.. sex right now.." Mijo chuckled a bit and told her, "Me too.. But.. as long as we're both consenting.. and have proper protection.." Mijo trailed off, wondering if the dark world had condoms or they just used magic.

"Oh, that.. Mijo.. Let's.. let's at least touch each other, without.." asked Rhida, before stopping herself, unsure if she should continue. "Oh..? I think that'll tempt us.. but.. I do want to see you, so.. if you want to, just say the word." answered Mijo, with a thoughtful expression.

Jomi pops inside the tent. "Hey..! Oh.." Rhida and Mijo are in the middle of undressing each other, and look at Jomi all flustered. "Oh..? I see.. I'm genuinely so sorry about.. everything here.." Jomi looks at the device. "Don't mind me.." Jomi is obviously aroused but somehow she manages to stay composed, and fiddle with the machine. "Oh.. a.. prototype protocol.. Wait, why did it enable.." Jomi uses some internal programs to check the protocol. "Oh.. oh.. Ah.. Haha.. It's.. I am sorry.." Jomi types something and the gas starts to dissipate as they are allowed to leave again. Throughout all of it, the duo had been just looking at Jomi, swirling with emotions.

"I have to explain myself, again.. Gosh, I am so sorry.. It's just a lot to explain." said Jomi, as she is showing a shy smile. "Hey.. at least you didn't have to experience.. lust for an absurdly amount of time!" Mijo pouted, with a smile as Rhida quietly dressed up again. 

"Well, I had my fair share.. Anyways, so.. like, I was testing this Chalo thing right? So, after I did some tests one night, I forgot to turn off this experimental protocol, that mixed my.. magic to create.. this—" Jomi gestures to the current room. "So that.. you know, a girl has to.. let out sometimes, get me Rhida?"

"Y—yeah.. But, I didn't expect you to be the type to create stuff like this, I thought Mijo did that?" said Rhida, with a smug smile. "W—what?! J— A—anyways, yeah. I also agree, you're a rebel leader and the dark princess right? So, how did you get the idea for this?" responded Mijo, a bit embarrassed.

"Old books, et cetera... The usual. Hey! You know my relation to Mijo, it'll only make sense haha." answered Jomi, before she gestured for them to leave with her. "Alright. Let's go. Before it gets more awkward, hehe." The three leave the tent, Jomi bringing the Chalo device with her.

 _Scenario 3: Jomi invites the rest of the Dark Pearl to a party / gathering to have fun but a conversation happens, and things get.. spicy._

The Dark Pearl is hanging out, as Mijo is on his corner, sleeping. As he does so, the others talk near him, notably a certain Jomi and Rhida.

"Hey, how's it been? How's.. how's everything, I mean.. it's been a while since we had these types of events.. In fact, I am quite busy this time of the year due to.. the dual power situation.. But, I got a little time to breathe it seems, so.. we're here! That's my story, how 'bout yours, Rhida?" asked Jomi, as Rhida looked at her thoughtfully.

"I've been.. doing fine.. As well, usual school stuff.. I've been working in that Anti-Drug and Journalism Club Stuff.. The usual.. I mean, it's not bad that it's usual, it's just how it is, I guess. The.. hell week hasn't started.. Nor the important stuff for this grading yet.." said Rhida, as she gazed over Mijo, who was still sleeping. "What's with.. him? He's usually the life of the party.. Well, when he's comfortable or course. But, everyone here is his friend.." 

"Oh, yeah.. I don't know, I haven't asked. He arrived and slept on the nearest couch, though.. he usually doesn't sleep in the dark world.. Hold on, let's go to him." responded Jomi, before they walked over to Mijo. "Hmm.. I'll let you wake him up." said Jomi with a small grin, as Rhida also looked at her with a small chuckle.

"Hey.. babe.. ahem. I mean, love— ah! Uh.. Mijo wake up please." Rhida's voice somehow managed to wake up the sleeping Mijo. "Huh..? What do you want.. luv.." Mijo says groggily not realizing Jomi is also there. "Aww.. ah! I mean, yeah.. I just.. We have a couple of questions, hehe.. You can sleep later, right?" answered Rhida, as Mijo takes in his surroundings.

"Ah.. sure." Mijo stands up, towering over Rhida and matching Jomi's height. "Haha.. Sometimes I forget how tall you are. And how small.. You sure you can take it, Rhida?" Jomi says, with a sly smile and wink. "What do you mean.. uh.. HEY! uh.. his height doesn't mean anything. Hmmph." said Rhida, as she looked away.

"Hah? Hold on.. lemme.. ah! You don't have to assume, don't you.. since—" responded Mijo with a sarcastic tone. "HEY! Stop. Please don't mention that. Ever. Remember, we are both implicated." interrupted by Jomi, Rhida is very confused but moves on, expecting the two to not reveal anything yet. "Haha.. Ah.. First Question!" Rhida tried to move on, but she actually hasn't thought of anything.

"Mijo, answer truthfully. Have you, in your life, ever thought of.. sexual things towards us, any one of us? Rhida, me, Urda, everyone you met?" asked Jomi, as Mijo was shocked and was blushing a bit. "Ah! That— Jomi! Isn't that too much..?" asked Rhida, a bit surprised by Jomi's words.

"Ah.. I agree.. but.. you know.. uh.. Ok, well.. with Jomi, quite a lot actually.. Like every month or so, I often wonder what it would be like if we—" answered Mijo, hesitating. "Too much detail. Please.. just.. move on. I have seen it with my own eyes multiple times." interrupted Jomi, before Mijo continued. "Yeah, as for the others.. My.. my.. ah.. I am.. ashamed to admit.. but.. like.. just... ugh.. the photos we had, I.. fancied it for a while."

Mijo looked away, super embarrassed. "Jomi.. That's enough.." Rhida stepped in, regretting what she just heard. "Oh, sorry.. I am just used to teasing him. If you're feeling uncomfortable, don't be afraid to say it." Jomi smiles, as she takes a step back. "Um.. I guess.. that's just how turbulent we are, huh?" said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo's back.

"Alright, let's move on. Mijo, what's the status update to you two, and Rhida?" asked Jomi, as Mijo turned around to face the two, more composed. "Oh? Ask her." 

"Hey! You do it.. Hmph, you're the one that is being questioned, not me!" responded Rhida sarcastically, her smile being directed at Mijo. "Yeah, I want to hear it straight from you, Mijo. What's your deal with Rhida?" asked Jomi, with a small smile.

"Ah.. Well ever since the new dark world, we uh.. we've been together for 2 months. 'Together' as in speaking about random stuff in between battles and school. It's like.. a couple of minutes, I don't think you can consider that developed yet." Mijo explains, a bit neutral as Rhida started off with a thoughtful look.

"Mijo's.. right. We never get to hang out outside of here.. It's just small glances and stuff, because.. I am always so busy, and.. Mijo's often busy too! Only here, we get to share moments.. I just wish that the next student's night was closer.. so we could hang out again." added Rhida with Mijo also saying, "Hopefully no problems.."

"Haha.. I get you. My life's workload has significantly increased this time.. Mmm.. I should probably consider getting more people.. Ah, forget about it. You two have a lot in mind already." said Jomi, before Rhida asked another question, with questionable intent. "I have a question, how do you deal.. with your dailies Jomi? Me and Mijo are students, right? So, I am genuinely curious.. what do you do everyday? You never told us in detail.."

"Ah.. Well, I can tell you a little.." Jomi stops and looks at their eyes before sitting down. "So, I wake up, cook and eat my food.. Since, huh.. I should get a chef.. Anyway, after that, I shower and get dressed in casual clothes, or a dress.. the battle one. The casual ones, depend actually, mayor wear, and.. whatever I can scrounge up and put into my closet. I do the boring political stuff, you get it.. Then I have lunch, then dinner, and go to bed.. Um, in those like.. times, I can visit.. so.. it's not that I don't have time.. but, uh.. more.. important things to do, haha." answered Jomi, to the amusement of the other two.

"Wow. Just like I expected, yes!" said Mijo, happy about Jomi's routine. "Haha, you know me a lot, Mijo. In fact, you know me as you know yourself." said Jomi with a smirk, as she looked at Mijo's eyes. "I do, huh.." Mijo trails off,  not knowing what to respond next.

"Alright, you know what, you two. I have a *'surprise'* for you. Come with me." said Jomi, confusing the other two. "Jomi, what's this _surprise?_ of yours?" asked Rhida, as Jomi smiled while directly looking at Rhida. "Trust me, you'll both enjoy it." Jomi winks at both of them.

They reluctantly follow Jomi, going up the stairs and going by rooms of unknown occupancy as they arrive at a colored door, yellow and light blue mixed with a wavy pattern. "We're here, now I'd prepare if I was you." said Jomi with sarcastic undertones. Before any of the two could speak, Jomi opened the door and it contained a huge queen-sized bed with small tables on either side packed with cabinets.

"Jomi..? Tell me that I am wrong on what you're thinking, right now." said Mijo, before Jomi grinned at him and left the room. Locking the door behind her with magic. Before the two could react, an aphrodisiac gas suddenly started to fill the room, coming from exhaust pipes on the roof.

"H—hey! Jomi, you wingwoman! Stop forcing us in.. these situations!" said Rhida, as her body heated up. "Y—yeah.. I think we're stuck here until we.. uh.. do the thing." added Mijo, as his body also heated up, his hardness being obvious to Rhida.

"E—eh..? Mijo.." said Rhida, as she noticed his bulge. "It's.. a natural response!" responded Mijo, as he looked away, ashamed and blushing. "I—It's my fault too.. I shouldn't be looking.." said Rhida, as she looked away too, flustered.

Jomi knocks at the door and says, "Ah hold on, I think I left something there." Jomi opens the door and looks at the two flustered lovebirds, then goes to the cabinets. "How are _you_ not affected, Jomi?" asked Mijo, as Jomi went through the cabinets. "Oh? I am, Mijo. I just.. have a certain tolerance now." explained Jomi, as she brought out a purple vibrator. "Hey! Isn't that a—" asked Rhida before Jomi interrupted, "Don't mention it. I was.. using this room before. Both of you understand, no?" Mijo and Rhida nodded. "Well, are you going to turn the gas off?" asked Mijo, as he started to tremble due to the intense arousal. "Sure." Jomi uses her magic to turn the device off but she accidentally transferred a lot of it's essence to the two. "Ah! Oh no.. My bad, uh.. enjoy? It should last a while, but it dissipates. How long it is? That's for you to find out. Tell it to me when you're done, capiche? Ok." Jomi leaves and closes the door.

_Scenario 4: Exams are nearing, and so is the pressure and stress. Mijo is looking out of a balcony, with so many unfinished tasks, he's beginning to lose it_

Mijo is listening to somber melancholic music, as he looks out to the intense rain happening right in front of him.

"I am a failure..." Mijo says, as he looks out, alone with his thoughts. "I can't keep up. I can't. The pressure.. it.. broke me." Mijo continues, as he continues to be alone in his own thoughts.

"I am no longer fit to be any position of power." Mijo says again, repeating his own thoughts. "I should.. listen, and stay dead. The willpower? Gone. That fire? Gone." Mijo continued, tears almost flowing out before he stopped himself.

"No one's here to comfort me. Rhida's busy with research, Kai (Ikari) and Lauv (Lauvielle), they've both gone home. Urda's on some, random stuff.. But, she's still busy. I know that perfectly well." Mijo looks to his right, seeing Urda with some of her other friends. Mijo looks back to the rain, he felt the rain getting more intense, he's not sure if it's his imagination anymore.

"It's lucky.. that we even got a half day today. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do." Mijo looked to his left, he sees JR walking out. But then, Lauvielle appeared and he looked away. "That's probably for research, forget about it. I don't think they need more of.. this." said Mijo, before he picked up his bag and left his spot. 

He went down the stairs, noticing the flooding on his feet. Then he walked slowly through the corridors of the school, passing by people worried for their research. Afterwards, he walked past his old classrooms. "Oh.. these.."  murmured Mijo to himself, as he continued walking. Soon after, he arrived at a waiting area. He noticed Ikari there.

"Kai..?" said Mijo, as he went closer to her. "Yeah, it's me! You're stuck here too? Are you commuting? The rain's really heavy right now..!" said Ikari, as he put down his bags nearby. "Yeah, I am commuting.. I just have to wait for this to end." said Mijo as he watched the rain fall. Ikari noticed his unusual attitude, he was nonchalant, but he's... too calm. But, she didn't push it, she had her own problems anyway.

"Yeah, I am waiting for my dad, which by the way, was supposed to be arriving.. thirty minutes ago!" ranted Ikari, as she also watched the rain. "Oh, that's.. funny.. haha." remarked Mijo, his laugh being a bit more fake than she expected. "Hmph. You're lucky. My dad's arriving after that online quiz is done, plus my bilao painting." joked Ikari, as she waited impatiently for her dad.

"Oh, cool." said Mijo, a bit nonchalant. "Mijo! The water.. it's.. overflowing the drainage, quick! Let's go!" said Ikari, noticing the flooding and another nearby elevated waiting area. Mijo nods and they head there, making their shoes wet but the clothes not so much. They arrive at the other waiting area, catching their breath. "Whew.. it's a good thing this piece of shit plastic envelope didn't fail and my laptop died from one drop of rainwater." commented Ikari, as she washed off the droplets of rain on her envelope.

"Haha.. yeah.." responded Mijo, trying to keep up with the conversation. "Anyways.. This mfer.. is going to take as long as if I walked home, twice!" continued Ikari, as she frantically looked at her phone. "True.." Mijo stops himself, he was going to joke about how he could've also walked home, but he didn't know what Ikari would think. "Well.. I don't fucking know what to do now.." Ikari crossed her arms and was looking at the vehicles on the road as the rain continued to pour.

Mijo looks at their surroundings, he doesn't want to disturb Ikari about his problems, since he knows of her family and school problems, he doesn't want to add on to that. "It's 2:30.." remarked Mijo, before Ikari screamed in frustration. "There he is! Fucking god.." said Ikari, as she points to a tricycle that looked like Ikari's dad. "Well.. see you, Mijo. Bye~~~" said Ikari, as she rushed to the tricycle, leaving Mijo in the waiting area. "I should go. The rain is weakening." said Mijo as he walked in the rain, eventually commuting and going home, not before noticing the argument between Ikari and her father.

_Scenario 5: Mijo after going through the most stressful and crushing two weeks he goes into the dark world, very unstable physically, mentally, and emotionally_

"Hey..! Mijo." said Jomi, as she greets him with a hand wave. "Mhm." Mijo dismissed her and continued walking. "Huh? Mijo.." Jomi walks up to him but he pushes her back. "No. Stay away." Mijo says to Jomi firmly as he continues on his way, his destination unclear. "Mijo..? I.. can't let you be alone, y'know. I gotta at least know." said Jomi, before Mijo glared at her with his lightning magic flaring. He stares at her, his lightning magic all around him before he looks away, turning his back and says, "I'm going to Nuevo León." said Mijo before walking to the portal that took them there.

"Wait! Why..!" shouted Jomi as she ran to Mijo, he already entered the portal so she stopped on the edge of the portal doorway. "What is he doing.." muttered Jomi to herself, as Rhida arrived at the dark world and saw Jomi. "Hey, Jomi? Were you about to go to Nuevo León?" asked Rhida, as Jomi stepped back, a bit surprised but nodded. "Oh, ok. Did you see Mi-mi around here?" asked Jomi, referring to Mijo. "Yeah, he went in. Let's find him, I don't think he's in a good headspace." said Jomi, as they went inside and saw the familiar walls.

"Ok, so.. where could he have gone.. hold on, let me detect his energy." said Jomi, as she does some magical spell. "Wait? You can do that?" asked Rhida, as Jomi awkwardly smiled as she finished the spell. "Uh.. yeah.. I had to.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll teach it later. It involves.. a lot more intimacy that you probably don't want to hear about, don't worry, just follow me, and you'll find your boyfriend, ok?" said Jomi, with a smile as Rhida chuckled and responded, "Alright. You know me. Let's go." Rhida and Jomi walked, Jomi following something invisible to everybody else.

Eventually they arrive at a random part of a huge forest, as they hear fighting. "Hm, I think that's him. Keep your weapons ready, just in case." Jomi summons her ōdachi, while Rhida summons her ice sword. "Ready, Jomi." said Rhida, before they approached the noise. As soon as they arrive, they see Mijo letting loose on some grunts and monsters around the forest, decimating them one-by-one. He's wearing headphones that seem to not go off of him as he slashes and dices the monsters with anger that he seemed to be letting out.

He noticed them, but he doesn't care, he continues his onslaught against the grunts and monsters, as the two looked on, very concerned. "Jomi.. you know how to deal with this..?" whispered Rhida to Jomi. "I.. uh.. I guess you haven't seen much of his darker side, no?" whispered back Jomi. "What.. um.. explain." responded Rhida, before Mijo finished and looked at the two. "You found me, huh? Well, whatever. Let me make it clear," said Mijo, before he pointed his ōdachi and sheath at the two. "don't come for me. Else you'll get my wrath."

The two freeze on the spot, Rhida is frozen, she'd truly never seen him like this before, and she'd not even talked to him for a month or two, so she doesn't know what to make of her boyfriend's new attitude. "Mijo..? I understand needing to be alone, but.. you know this is just inflicting endless pain on others, even if we're their enemies." said Jomi, as Mijo stumbled back a bit before raising his sword again. He falters a bit in his words, "I.. stop. SHUT UP!" Mijo teleports to Jomi, their swords clashing.

Rhida takes a step back, now shaking, as she doesn't know what to do with the two people she considers to be close friends, fighting. "Please, Mijo. You know we can.. alleviate this at least. Please, put the sword down. Let us talk. Rhida's here right? She's your love, and I am your other side, I don't know if we can fix your problems, but.. lashing out like this, isn't the solution." said Jomi, as Mijo's magic falters a bit, the words getting to him. 

"I.. can't take it anymore! Jomi! You know how much I feel every fucking day! I am stuck, in a seat for 7 hours, far away from my friends, my loved ones, you! Just so school can give me a grade I feel hollow for. I feel alone, no matter how much you say, I can't say I am happy for most of the times I live on this fuckin world. Even here, I can't feel anything when I am not angry or crying at the edge of a cliff. So! If you're the true therapist and mature one between the two of us, tell me. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG. WITH ME?!!" responded Mijo to Jomi, as Rhida teared up, seeing herself in him as well as empathy for her lover.

Jomi went silent. Mijo quickly pulled back before summoning slashes against Jomi, forcing her to parry. "I.. want to help you, Mijo.." said Jomi as she kept deflecting and dodging Mijo's continuous attacks. "But.. you're forcing my hand.." said Jomi, as she began to attack as well. "Stop! Please! Mijo, calm down!! Jomi, please find a way to calm him down!" shouted Rhida, as both of the two stopped. "I.. know." said Jomi, as she saw Mijo's lightning flicker a bit. Mijo looked at Rhida, then Jomi, before stabbing himself in the heart. "MIJO!!!" shouted the other two, as the two ran to his body. "I.. don't think he can die. But, he's.. escaping us. I'll try to heal it, but.. I don't think I am welcome in Mijo's mind." said Jomi, as she healed him after pulling the sword out.

"I.. I can try." said Rhida as she looked at Mijo, concerned. "Hmm.. Good point. I'll transport you in there right now, do note that your body here will go limp due to the transfer of consciousness." explained Jomi, as Rhida looked at hands and chest before nodding. "Ok, I acknowledge." said Rhida, before Jomi did a magical spell and Rhida fainted.

"Whew.. I.. guess that's weird.. I wonder if that's how Jomi does it.." said Rhida, before she saw Mijo, in his school clothing. They're at a hallway of their school, near their current classrooms. "Oh, well.. that makes sense." Rhida walks up to Mijo. "Hey.. Mijo?" Mijo turned around, very imposing on Rhida. Mijo's eyes were narrowed before going back to normal. "Oh, Rhida. What are you doing here?" asked Mijo, as he looked behind her. "Um, uh.. I.. just wanted to speak to you. Like before, haha."

"Hm? I thought you didn't go to school today. From what I've heard at least." said Mijo, as Rhida eyes widened. "Oh, really..? Um, well.. I  am here, now." said Rhida, as she realized that in Mijo's dream, she's already gone. "I see." said Mijo as he stared off absent-mindedly behind him. "This is a dream, isn't it?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Yeah. Uh, did you know..?"

 "Well, I was doubtful if this was real. But now you're here, It's a dream." said Mijo, as he looked back at Rhida. Rhida teared up a bit, she didn't know why. "Ah.. um.. I.. I see." said Rhida, looking at a stern Mijo. "You're.. different. I don't think I ever talked to you in my dreams. You even approached me." remarked Mijo, as he looked away. "Because.." Rhida says in-between sobs. "I am Rhida.. The real one, I was brought here by Jomi. She's.. healing you right now."

Mijo doesn't even react, but he stops for a while, before turning to look at Rhida. "Hm. I guess that's expected. But, I didn't know _you_ would be here." said Mijo, as his face remained neutral. "Ah.. well, this is all so new to me anyway. I.. I.." said Rhida before she hugged him. Mijo was initially surprised, but returned the hug, patting her back. "Hey.. hey, what's the problem? I.." asked Mijo before stopping himself. "It's just.. I can't bear seeing you like this, Mijo.. Why didn't you tell me..? We promised to talk to each other without hiding anything, remember?"

Mijo remained silent, as his body stiffened. "Please.. Mijo, you can let it out. We're in a dream.. and, I promise, I won't tell anyone. Not even Jomi— if you don't want to." said Rhida, as Mijo tightened the hug. "Tell her. She deserves to know." responded Mijo, as they both pulled back. 

"Okay. Just so you know, I've.. always felt alone. I don't want to admit it, because.. it's selfish, no? I've been surrounded with people willing to help me, and yet I feel alone? What's this, just talk with them, it's not that hard.." explained Mijo, as Rhida listened intently, calming down. "Yet, I do still feel it... I admit, even with my achievements, and successes, I doubt myself. I can't figure out if I should be confident because I can't find the balance between self-criticism and self-assurance." continued Mijo, as he walked to the balcony in their second floor hallway.

"This.. pressure to stay and maintain scores, quizzes, performance tasks, and my facade of staying obedient to these.. these.. officers. I don't get it anymore, I am losing the battle, and it feels so hard to keep fighting. The teachers' don't help, I understand their comments on the class, but I.. feel like they **try** to understand us, but each individual has different problems, issues that some might help, but others make it worse." continues Mijo, as Rhida moved to his left and looked at him thoughtfully.

"I.. just feel so hopeless. I want to escape, but every time.. It makes things worse, so.. it repeats. I feel worse, so I escape, but that makes things worse, so repeat." Mijo looks at Rhida, disappointed. "The worst part is.. it's inherent in my behavior. I don't think I or Jomi have told you this before, but.. we both came to consensus that both of us have some form of either ADHD or Autism." said Mijo, as Rhida widened her eyes. "Since, you know.. we are **kinda** related—" said Mijo, with a smile and a wink. "—we both have this.. form. So, while she can manage it, due to her prowess and.. well, just being more powerful with her life, she manages it quite well. I asked her about it, some time ago."

Rhida nods, as Mijo continued. "I.. know, this is a monologue, but you came into my dream so.. haha.. Anyways, because of our differences in our situation about our own support systems and control of our lives, I have.. a more rash personality. Even though, yes.. I am better at fighting, she's generally good at magic. Basically my ideal self. I guess.. I have to admit, while I look very masculine, I have an interest in other forms, like Jomi's. Another form of escapism, I guess." Mijo takes a huge breath as he turns to Rhida, his head closer to her head. "I think Jomi's done." Mijo kissed Rhida, as she was initially surprised but quickly returned the long kiss, as Mijo woke up.

The two are in the same bed, with the two cuddling each other, as Jomi watches them, with a grin. As soon as the two returned to their life, the two felt each other and quickly pulled back. "Ah! M—Mijo..?" said Rhida, as Mijo responded, "Rhida..!" as they look at each other, both flustered. "Oh, you two are awake.. I was beginning to think that Mijo was doing more intimate stuff with you." said Jomi, talking to Rhida, the closer one to her.

"H—Hey! I swear.. there'll be a day I'll get back at you.." said Rhida, a bit flustered but smiling. "Wingwoman Jomi, as always." added Mijo, as the other two chuckled a bit. "Alright. Well, let's go. Unless you want me to leave?" asked Jomi, with a grin. "HEY! Jomi, come on girl.." Rhida is blushing more as she gets out of bed. "Well, I feel much better. Let's go, before we run out of free time." said Mijo, smiling for the first time in a while as he got out of bed. "Awww.. Mijo..! Anyways, yeah I agree. Let's go out, I got some errands we can do together, haha!" said Jomi as they both left the tent.

## A Night in Dajovy - jmb draft 1

---

"Thought it will never come to this.." said Mijo as he looked at the room around him, his thoughts swirling around with bouts of hatred, self-loathing and feelings of inadequacy. "Whatever. I just need to do something. Then it'll go away." Mijo goes to his computer and starts writing, losing himself in another fantasy.

As soon as Mijo felt tired, he realized it was late at night again. The cycle was there again, no matter how much he tried, the same cycle of events happened. He decided to look around him, and then his phone. "Ah shit. I haven't even done anything. Just, lost in my own pleasure of AI and whatever chase I can get." Mijo sighs at this comment, he knows he's right and it bothers him.

"What's with me? I don't get it! I feel like, the more I force control on my world, the more I fall back into my habit, my cure to my depression," Mijo looks around him and decides to jump into the dark world inside his backpack, he wasn't taking it, all the control he couldn't get.

_Into the Dark_

Mijo jumps in, feeling the power surge through him. "Wow.. these.. I always forget." Mijo walks until he finds Jomi in her usual routine, talking with government employees about her kingdom, usual princess stuff. "Jomi.." He quickly ran up to her, just as they finished their discussion.

"Oh, um.. Mijo?" asked Jomi, as Mijo hugged her. "Jomi, it's been a while. I've been enjoying my vacation." Jomi and Mijo chuckle as they head into the castle. "So, what's the point here?" asked Jomi as Mijo chuckled. "Honestly, nothing. Just literally on will. Do I have any doubts or issues, that I wanna talk about? Yes, but those have been done to death, pun intended." Mijo says as he stretches his body.

"Done to death? What, is there a limit to how much you can talk about stuff?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, yeah! There is!! I swear I hate talking about how my life sucks! I want to do something cool! But I'm also depressed. So, really I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place." said Mijo as they arrived at Jomi's castle and headed inside, seeing the opulent palace he's used to, Mijo feels a sense of comfort as they head to Jomi's bedroom.

"I'm getting tired of the simple life. The complaining, the whining! Jeez! People really like to say, oh why can't I just forgive and let go, follow their orders, it makes sense to! I DON'T CARE! Seriously, every single fucking time, there's this nagging feeling of what's this person going to think, how about the future? BITCH I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!" Mijo says as he prances around Jomi's room, his electrifying energy, messing up the room a bit.

"Oh, I get it—" Jomi was cut off by Mijo. "I'm getting tired of the same old tired reminders BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE OR CHANGE WHAT THE FUCK!?" said Mijo as he manically punches himself and falls to Jomi's bed. "I'm soo tired of trying so hard, to get STUPID RESPONSES LIKE oh that doesn't matter, you must study, or that writing and gaming are all pointless, if you don't study! LIKE MOTHERFUCKER SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME ENJOY MYSELF BEFORE I STAB YOU WITH THIS SWORD OF JUSTICE AND FUCKING EVISCERATE YOUR PIECE OF SHIT BRAINDEAD DUMBASS!" shouted Mijo as his electricity intensified, and his body transformed into a woman, usual for Jomi and Mijo.

"Oh, um.. you're uh.. agitated.. just.. keep it here okay?" said Jomi as she leaned to the wall, the ever eager listener. "FUCK! I am so horny at the same time! Whenever I wanna do something hard it feels as though I'm basically hurting myself, but if I don't do anything, I also feel like hurting myself, and when I do fun stuff, I am dulling myself until it goes too far, or.. it's an addiction! BITCH IF I DON'T HAVE A GOOD LIFE THEN YES I'M GOING TO GET ADDICTED, DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO HEAL FROM ACCEPTANCE OF DEATH?! IT'S NOT A FUCKING WEEK AND NEITHER IT HELPS IF I STILL HAVE TO FACE SCHOOL DURING AND AFTERWARDS!" shouted Mijo, her screaming voice resembling those metal and rock vocalists.

"I swear, whenever I think and try to say, all they can say is invalidation or some stupid thing that doesn't do anything. I just want to be validated! BUT HOOLLY SHIIT DO PEOPLE JUDGE YOU AND FUCKING BOTHER YOU! I HAVE TO BE AT ALERT, ALWAYS FUCKING ON THE BRIIINK! It feels like ranting doesn't exist anymore, or I can't just be me, because if I'm me, they fucking don't like it." Mijo does a mock finger gun shooting at herself before collapsing at the bed, exhausted.

"I.. will let you rest here, if you want. I promise to always help you whenever you come here.." said Jomi, as Mijo held her hand firmly but lovingly. "Thank you, Jomi.. You're my only hope and.. light in this fucking dark world that somehow is the light, when the exact opposite is true in my opinion." said Mijo as she drifted off to sleep, cuddling Jomi, making her blush but letting Mijo do it because they're close friends.. siblings? Technically? Same person, different forms..

## Transformed Gunz tu da Extrem Draft 1

## Author's Note:

***SEXUAL WARNING LOLOLOLOL SKIP IF NOT INTERESTED***

---

Mijo whimpers as she looks at herself in the mirror, naked. "What.. the fuck am I looking at?" Mijo touches her breasts, tempting her to touch her nipples, sending her spiraling. "No.. the fudge.. ah.. stop.. why.. am I doing this?" Mijo pulls back. "Jeezus.. I'm like.. one step to just.. touching myself right here.. but I can't. My parents are next door.." Mijo pouts in annoyance, and sighs as she goes away from the mirror and sits on her bed.

"You know, I've always wondered what the situation is with.. how I work. Like, okay.. so I got this super secret magic from that previous' student night, I got a potion, makes me able to transform into a girl anytime. Best part? No pregnancy, yes! Mainly because, the bodies from the dark world.. Uh... I haven't asked regular darkners, how do they make children?" asked Mijo to herself, before shaking her head. "Nevermind. I guess.. I don't have to dive In Utero, no Bleach needed. Anyways, enough with the witty obvious references.. Maybe I should.. uh.. do I... no.. does she Smells Like Teen Spirit?" Mijo raises her arms and chuckles to herself.

"Ha! Finally.. Anyway, what should I do? Maybe go into the dark world? Uh.." said Mijo as she picked up a dice and rolled it. "Damn it.. 2? What did I.." Mijo blushed, as she covered herself with her arms. "No.. I have to.. convince Jomi.. to have.. that fun sex time,  uh.. while wearing.." Mijo rolls dice again. "What?! 2?! a.. bunny suit.." Mijo whimpers as she goes to her pile of clothes in her drawer and searches until she finds the bunny suit. "A.. friend..? No, she like.. why did she buy this?!" Mijo tries it out in the mirror. It, in all respects is pretty revealing. "Uhh... I feel weird.. noo... It's like I'm fudgin. begging for sex. jeezus.." 

Mijo sighs as she goes to her backpack and opens it, jumping into the dark world.

_A Dark Arena, to Jomi's Castle_

"Alright! Let's have.. fudge.. I'm just gonna be straight with her.. well no.. Not straight, lesbian." Mijo chuckles before running straight to Jomi's bedroom, trying to block out the darkners and his friends around her. She eventually arrives and hurriedly knocks at Jomi's bedroom. "Let me in!" Mijo exclaimed as Jomi opened, immediately jumping back and blushing due to Mijo's choice of clothing. "Did you.. Are you wearing the bunny costume Rhida got you?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded and hurriedly went inside and closed the door behind her,

"I.. yeah...! Okay, I had to keep it.. I didn't know she would buy it! Much less... collaborate with Urda and Ikari to surprise me with it at the reunion.." Mijo blushes as she shakes Jomi. "Sex..! Please!" Jomi pushes Mijo back, a bit shaken. "Calm down! You're not dying of sex hunger right? You're not a succubi right? So calm down..!" said Jomi, as Mijo sat on the bed, still a bit horny as she whimpered. "Okay.. but like.. you get me.. I.. swear.. if only.. I had my own room.. and.. well.. basically.. hadn't had to contend with a side effect that turns me into a woman for a week.. AHH!!" responded Mijo as she laid on the bed/

"Listen.. I'm... fine.. I'm doing the thing you want me to do, just.. don't expect much okay?" Jomi undresses as she straddles Mijo. "So.. what..?" said Jomi as Mijo rubs their pussies together. "Gah.. what.. come on.." Jomi bites her lip, stifling a moan. "Need it.." Mijo kisses Jomi, with a dominating touch as the friction, pulls them closer to the edge. "Touch.." Mijo started to touch Jomi's breasts, while Jomi does the same, overstimulating them both and bringing them to their high, as their intense orgasm rips through them, the wetness covered their thighs as they collapse on the bed.

"Thanks.. I guess that wasn't much.. But.. I needed it.. mmm.." Mijo says as she cuddles Jomi. "A—again.. just because we can do this doesn't mean you can't just.. do it every time..! But I will allow it for now.. Don't be surprised if I eventually.. ah.." Jomi eases into the touch as Mijo drifts off to sleep. "Ah.. horny ahh.. muddlefudger.. Seriously.. get help.. but.. I.. I'm letting you.. do... this.." Jomi murmurs before falling asleep.

"I don't know what to do again, but I have some idea.." said Mijo to herself, before she realized she is tied up by some tentacles, she was staring off and stuck in her mind. "What.. happened?" asked Mijo, as she tried to get out, but it seems strong. Mijo silently tries to get out but it seemed the tentacles are more like vines and they have pierced Mijo's skin, and have attached itself to her body. "I.. don't remember.. Even what happened.. before I.. came here.." Mijo felt her chest suddenly have something move, she looks down, a camellia flower buried at her chest.

"Did.. huh?" said Mijo, before it started blooming, hurting her. "Gah! What.." exclaimed Mijo, she is struggling to keep her sanity and consciousness. At the corner of her eyes, she sees Jomi, she feels she knows her, but she can't remember what she remembers about Jomi, just the instict. "Mijo..? Mijo!" said Jomi, as she made Mijo look at her, dazed. 

"What.. wait.. it's you.." said Mijo, as she doesn't know what to do, seeing Jomi, in her purple battle dress, with purple pants and undershirt, a witch hat and tiara at her head. "I.. think.. I remember what happened now.." said Mijo, before she tried to break out of her restraints, only hurting her. "Help.." said Mijo, as Jomi responded. "I.. I'm taking you to your.. room." answered Jomi, as Mijo smiles.

"Voices.. they.. say.. I killed everyone.. I.. raped everyone.. Can't... stop.. them.. stop.." said Mijo, as a wave of pain surges through her making her scream again. "Body hurts.. everywhere.. Dajovy.. safe?" asked Mijo, taking all her strength to look at Jomi. "Yes. I was actually out there.. The city is safe.. There's small damage, and a few people injured, but it's fine. You don't have to worry." answered Jomi, reassuringly. 

"Ah.. okay.. I think.. I recognize you.. saw you.. restrain me.. These vines.. they're mine aren't they?" asked Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Yes. I do not know the exact details, but your friends.. well.. they said that you lost control of your powers after.. I think it was school related stuff?" recounted Jomi, as Mijo chuckled. "Of course.." said Mijo, before a tentacle slithered and went close to Jomi, holding a flower. "A flower.. that camellia.. have it.." said Mijo, before she went unconscious.

_A haze in my mind.. Why can't I remember anything?_

Mijo woke up, as she looked around her room. It seemed that Jomi has enabled her calming and soothing mode of the room to help her recover. "I.. this is.." said Mijo, as she felt her body relax. "Wow.. she works wonders.." commented Mijo, before laying down at her bed. "My transformations.. the vines.. they.. represent my.. power.. but.. my own.. emotions." said Mijo, before she sat up. She saw one of her vines move to her hand, like a tentacle from herself.

"I.. will always have more.. power as a girl." said Mijo, as she transformed to a boy, his original form. "I.. hate being like this." continued Mijo, as he looked around him, his anger being dampened by the room. "Dependent on her.. everyday.." said Mijo, standing up as he felt a headache get worse. "I.." said Mijo, as he switches back to his girl form. "Get out.." said Mijo, as her magic started to burn away her clothes, with vines sprouting out from her body, sprawling about. "Can't.. breathe..." murmured Mijo, as she felt her headache only get worse.

"This only happens if.." trailed off Mijo, before she fainted, unable to keep her anger from affecting her, causing the room to increase it's mode, calming Mijo off to sleep, preventing her from falling to a catatonic state,

_I.. need.. Jomi.. Everything.. I need her.. My.. seed of fate.._

Mijo is walking around the city, wearing a simple baggy band tee and pants. This makes it clear she's a lightner to everyone around her, wearing a mix of medieval-like winter clothes. Her flowy hair fluttered in the breeze, there's no snow yet, but Mijo and everyone around her can feel the cold.

"*Seed of fate..*" murmured Mijo, as she walked around, her heels clicking, she actually doesn't wear heels that much, but she impulsively decided on it. "What do I do with you..?" asked Mijo to herself, as she sees Jomi in the distance, talking to the populace. "Fit for an abyss queen.. and the princess of the dark. Also now, the leader of the world of.. what did she call it? Yes, Kultima." Mijo smiled as she ran up to Jomi.

"Oh? Mijo, enjoying the festive spirit?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded and smiled. "Yes! Of course I am. With you and my friends, I'll almost be certainly happy." said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and put her hand on her shoulder. "Just enjoy this time, filled with stories.. and battles of interesting value, to you." said Jomi, as Mijo felt safe and reassured just by her presence. "Oh I almost will certainly will! *Seed of fate..*" responded Mijo before giggling.

"Oh? Where did you get that new nickname? *Seed of fate?* Sounds.." commented Jomi, before blushing slightly. "Ahem.. anyways, I'll allow it." said Jomi, before she is bothered by a guard on some random government tech issue. "Oh.. okay.. Mijo, I have to go do governing stuff, we can meet at the castle later, okay?" said Jomi, as Mijo nods, her smile fading. "Uhuh, I get it, go ahead then.." said Mijo, as Jomi bids goodbye. Mijo sighs as she looks at Jomi walking away.

"Jomi.. I will always want you.. my *seed of fate..* You're the only one in my life that I feel real with.. I have offered everything for you, and you have accepted it, and for that, I will always.. love.. you." said Mijo, as she turns around and continues her walk. "Love..?" Mijo laughs. "Obssession..!" exclaimed Mijo, as she combed her hair and continued her walk of the bustling city.

_Why? Why?! These memories.. I can't.. take it! Why do I have them?!_

Mijo is looking at the city from atop a hill nearby, the sky still clear enough to see the buildings, and the massive castle at the right of her. "WHY?!" shouted Mijo, as her vines wrapped around her, already beginning to grow more and restrain her. "I—I don't care about this past!" added Mijo, as her camellia flower on her chest burst out and bloomed, burning away her clothes.

"Stop.. non.. noo.." murmured Mijo, as her tentacles slither around her, aching to be used. "What do you want from me?" asked Mijo to herself. "Am I just.. stuck on depending on Jomi for everything?" questioned Mijo, as her tentacles snap and slap on the ground nearby, Her sword is summoned as another tentacle presents her weapon, the culmination of her power. 

"I.. need power.. Everything I've ever done.. myself, I just.. want someone to care.. but I don't feel.. as good when someone does it. Only her, my beloved *seed of fate.* I need her, everyday.." said Mijo, as her outburst subsides, as she distracts herself with thoughts of Jomi, and all the things they could do. 

"Oh so pathetic Mijo, you do know that this is not forever?" a voice rang out in her head. "What? I.. don't care.. I know that, and.. I think I would die first, before that ever happens." retorted Mijo, as the voice laughed. "How about your memories, don't you have to face them to be.. what do other people call it, 'normal'?" asked the voice, as Mijo shaked her head. "I.. do I have to?" asked Mijo, the words hanging in the air.

"Please.. I.. don't remember what.. you are talking about.. and.. I feel as though.. it's almost freeing if I don't.. face it.." said Mijo, as the voice laughed again. "You know you're lying. Everyone has told you, face it or **die.**" responded the voice, as Mijo's headache got worse, the camellia flower on her chest blooming.

"I.. ah.." said Mijo, as she is given her sword by her tentacles and stands up and walks to a nearby abyss corrupted zone, filled to the brim with monsters. "I would rather die." said Mijo, as she smiled and started expertly slashing through the monsters, at first, simply using her sword to summon slashes and the Iaiijutsu style of swift and precise draws and strikes with her sword, named 'Reddosupuringu', inspired from a videogame she loves to play often, and due to her unique nature, this is a completely new sword, as her old one, the 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' is at her room, gathering dust.

"*Don't run~ Keep the dance going!*" said Mijo, before transforming herself and her sword to purely use vines. Then as her camellia flower bloomed, she immediately set herself to the middle of the monster horde to burst the flower to the monsters with her vines wrapping around her arms and attaching to the flower to decimate around her. Mijo is maniacally laughing as she spins around to damage the other monsters spawning with her vines, her insticts taking over, and making her able to do a lot of stunts she stumbled at before.

"*Struggle harder~ Entertain me!*" said Mijo, as her burst of power shot up again, her vines feeding off the decimation of the monsters around her. Mijo pretty much danced her way through, the vines catching every single monster on her way. "Ahaha!! *Feed my blossoms~ Self-decievers!*" said Mijo to the monsters, as once again she transforms to her sword form. She immediately started her expert swordplay, knocking monsters into the air then smashing them to the floor.

Her power remained strong as she feeds off the monsters being destroyed, more sources making her more manic and power-hungry. "Yes! These flowers will bloom with the remnants of worthless minions..!" said Mijo as she finishes the last monster spawning, the abyss corruption receeding around her. As soon as the vegetation returned, around her camellia flowers bloomed. 

"Ah.. so.. precious.. battle.. my favorite.." said Mijo, as Jomi appeared behind her. "Wow.. I was going to look at the castle, but.. you weren't there so.. I figured you were off doing some abyss cleansing, and here you are, haha." said Jomi, as Mijo smiled and turned around. "Oh! I guess it was time for our meeting, silly me.. I must've forgotten, but you're here now." said Mijo, as she picked out a camellia and presented it to Jomi. "A flower.. I made. Like it?" asked Mijo, expectant of Jomi. "Uh.. mmm.." responded Jomi, as she took the flower and inspected it, her magic glowing.

"What? Is there something special? Tell me!" said Mijo, staring at Jomi's eyes focused at the flower. "It's.. good as always, but.. I think we should let this flower remain here, to bloom and to wilt." said Jomi, as she planted back the flower. "Oh.. haha.. right. I.. totally forgot." said Mijo, before Jomi looked her in the eyes and continued, "Hmm.. How about we go and.. clear out more abyss corruption? I'll be right by your side." Mijo's eyes glowed in happiness and excitement as she nodded. "Of course! Anything you want, I want too! Come on! I sense something there!" said Mijo, as she dragged Jomi with her to another abyss corruption zone.

"Lady Caj.. Interesting name.." said Mijo, as she walked around the unknown domain. Her clothes were ripped, and her vines surged around her. She carried her sword at her sheath, tied to her dress that barely held it, due to the already ruined fabric of her clothes. "Is this who I was.. or who this.. body was?" asked Mijo to herself, before a vision appeared right in front of her, seemingly, it's her looking out somewhere.

"I.. am.. not well.. Jomi, oh where is she..? She disappeared like a blip.. No one knows where she is.. or at least who they call the princess of the dark." said Lady Caj, as she walks. "Oh? Lady Caj— I've met her before. It seems the princess is truly an interesting individual." said Mijo to herself before continuing to walk around.

"I just hope I can find her.. before I arrive at that place again.. filled with.. nevermind. If I try to remember, I'll lose control again, and this time, she isn't here to.. stop me." said Lady Caj, before fading away. "Oh..? It seems that she is headed to.. a familiar place, hmm.. I'll see what it is." said Mijo, before entering a portal to a city, with a house in front of her, while any other way is blocked by vines. She tries to go any other way, but as soon as she tries to clear out the path, her head starts hurting so she pulls back and looks at the house again.

A younger Lady Caj appared in front of her, her clothes in a normal house clothing, crying. "Please..! Just understand.. I don't want to—" said Lady Caj, before she stops, seemingly listening to an unheard voice. "N—no..? You are saying that.. I.. have to..? To.. go to that institution.. and.. and.." responded Lady Caj, before crying more. "Leave me alone! Please—" Lady Caj looks like she is avoiding hands that seem to come out of nowhere. "PLEASE!!" said Lady Caj, as she accidently hit the hands, the hands quickly pulling back and disappearing. Lady Caj gasped and pulled back, a wall appearing behind her. "I'm sorry.. dad.." muttered Lady Caj before falling to the floor, her back firmly pressed on the wall behind her, as she hid her head and her hands were over her head, as she sobbed quietly. 

As the Lady Caj vision fades, Mijo narrows her eyes and looks away, clearly thinking about what she just saw. "What did I see? And why do I suddenly feel sad or.. even in the verge of tears..?" said Mijo, as she looks around her, the unfamiliar emotions getting to her head. "I don't remember this. But, that Lady Caj.. clearly, it's me. But, what's.. what happened? Why don't I use that name anymore? Or.. what made her.." trailed off Mijo, before shaking her head as another portal opens. "Whatever. I know my Jomi is still somewhere in this domain, and she's going to fix everything to prevent this rift from corrupting this world." said Mijo, reassuring herself before going to the portal and going inside.

Mijo appeared out of the portal, as Lady Caj was talking to someone unseen. "Jomi? D—did you.. what happened.. why.. Oh, you.. split yourself? But.. huh? Where are you going? Don't leave me! Please!!" said Lady Caj to an unseen figure before crying and fading away. The environment around Mijo is a field of flowers, with red camellias illuminating a path to a far-off place. "Hm. Is this.. the point where Jomi and Cara existed? And.. huh, I seem to be a bit sentimental.. pssh. Not that far off from me now, haha! But I've learned. Wait, does it count if I wiped my own memories? Oh well.." commented Mijo, before walking again.

Then a younger Lady Caj appeared wearing a school uniform, once again crying. "I just.. I didn't want to be here.. and now..? No, I didn't.. I had no.. I had no hope! Where should I've gone? Other than where my sister went. But.. it's pretty clear why I saw her struggle.. What about me? I'm less smart, less disciplined, and less sane! My situation only got worse! Everyone's always directing me, reminding me of my issues.. Why can't I stop it?! I.. please.. just leave me alone.." said Lady Caj, talking to someone unseen before the hands appeared out of nowhere and started touching her, almost trying to be lovely, but Lady Caj was not having it and slapped one of them, pushing them all back. "N—no.. not again.. I'm.. sorry.. mom.. I know you won't accept it anyway.." said Lady Caj, before sliding down to the floor, her eyes closing.

"Is that.. another memory..? Jeez, a lot of traumatic memories wiped from me? It's.. fortunate that I don't have them. Jomi is definitely going to be concerned if I told her of what I just saw, but.." said Mijo, as she looked at a camellia beneath her. "I have a feeling it would've been let out some way." added Mijo, before continuing her walk. She continued to walk, the sky cloudy with a red mist flowing throughout the sky, making Mijo smile at the red-colored cloud-covered sky.

Another Lady Caj vision emerged, as Mijo looks on, interested. This time Lady Caj, is doing something and speaking to herself. "She's been gone for a while.. My beloved *Jomi..* I need to find a way to.. get rid of these stupid memories, and prevent them from making me lose control. She's going to appear again, I know that. It's going to happen. I just.. don't know if I'll be alive.. or.. even be myself." said Lady Caj before disappearing and another Lady Caj appearing, this time, walking to an unseen device. "That's it. I'll meet her soon enough, but I can't live with these memories, the school one.. the home one.. the.. many.. more.. This.. will work, I hope when that day comes, the day that my beloved Jomi comes back.. Maybe I should leave a name behind, *Mijo.* A name fit for this new age." said Lady Caj, before disappearing.

"Is that when I decided I would wipe my own memories?" asked Mijo to herself, before another vision appeared this time, a boy and Lady Caj, sprawled out on the floor. "If Jomi split herself, then I shall combine instead. This.. person, a kindred being, I see his potential. Same past, same desires.. I want him to be me, after all.. whatever the past may be.. We are one." said Lady Caj, before disappearing.

Mijo was silent as she looked at the empty area where the vision used to be. "So.. that's why I remember a different past. As a non-magical boy living a not so happy childhood and teenhood.. She.. that's why." said Mijo, as she looked at herself, seeing that boy's school uniform, the home clothes, it feels as though, she remembers two version of the same exact events. "Interesting." said Mijo, before continuing to walk.

"Mijo.. Lady Caj.. these distinctions don't matter." said Lady Caj as she talks directly to Mijo. "Oh? And why is that, Lady Caj?" asked Mijo, as Lady Caj phased through her and looked at her smiling. "Because, now that you know our backstory, it doesn't matter what you choose as your true past, because you're both. I remember that boy that used to be, he was like me in a lot of ways. I'm sure you've remembered by now. A traumatic childhood and teenhood, a sister.. our obession with someone.. A Jomi if you will." said Lady Caj, as she approached Mijo smiling. "Mijo.. no.. Lady Caj, you are free now. Leave the past behind. We'll always have Jomi, and.. no one will stop us, powerful.." said Lady Caj as Mijo started to repeat her lines as well.

"A new self.. I'm not a loser anymore.. I'll prove it. Fate has led us together, Jomi.. No matter what form, corruption.. So, this.. is my show, and I'll complete it." said Mijo/Lady Caj, combining as she faces off a large abyss monster, the core of the rift affecting the environment, with Jomi beside her.

"Is that when I decided I would wipe my own memories?" asked Mijo to herself, before another vision appeared this time, Lady Caj, sprawled out on the floor. "I'm not as strong as beloved Jomi.. I can't split myself.. but.. I can wipe my own memories.. starting fresh! *Lady Caj*.. is out! *Mijo..* wake up." said Lady Caj, before falling asleep.

"Oh.. well.. I guess even Lady Caj wanted herself to disappear. At least.. by changing her name.. by changing my name.. I broke the shackles of my past." said Mijo, before continuing to walk, ending up at a final destination, overlooking the flowers, and the mist.

"All this talk of.. freedom.. Yet, what good is that freedom if you're powerless, a loser~" said Lady Caj, now directly talking to Mijo. "Shut up.." responded Mijo, as Lady Caj teleported behind her. "How pathetic, you do know that.. eventually, the past will come back. Then forgotten, so what is the point?" questioned Lady Caj, as she disappears, her more red aura transferring over to Mijo.

"Forget and be forgotten.. So what? I.. have traveled.. a lot of worlds. I have been everywhere, but one thing has been true. Everything changes, pulsates with growth when I met you, Jomi. You were always a princess, but I changed. From the most poor to the highest of luxury, I've always met you. My instincts, I trust them until the end, and with that, fate.. fate always brings me to you.." said Mijo, as she suddenly saw a large abyss monster, with Jomi nearby.

"You'll see me, at every end. Now.. let's crush this corrupted core!" said Mijo, as she readied her sword and vines with Jomi.

## Fan-Spinnin' Paper Draft 1

## Author's Note:

Take me home.. I wanna be alone. 

"Why don't you want to sleep?" "I wanna be alone."

—jmb

---

"Why..?" asked Mijo to herself as she looked at her surroundings. "The minutes tick by and.. I feel no sense of.. urgency to fulfill an obligation to rest for school tomorrow." said Mijo to herself, as she goes to a mirror and takes a good look at herself. She sees herself, then her boy form flickering before her eyes, before looking at her true self again. "I suddenly feel that.. no matter.. the events, the things I do.." said Mijo as previous instances of herself flash through her eyes like a video, from her beginning as a fresh out of online class highschool boy to a burned out, depressed and heavily anxious girl that she percieved herself as.

"Leading to the same outcomes, no matter how cool the reward, the feelings.. they all are buried beneath mountains of masks, and silence." continued Mijo, as she realized that she was near a balcony. She was up on a castle balcony, overlooking Dajovy City. "If I were to jump.. how would I feel? Acceptance? Remorse? Regret? Restlessness? or.. Numb?" asked Mijo as she laid on the railings and looked down, the older she got, the more she didn't fear heights, and preferred higher and higher, so if she wanted, her actions would work without interruption and problem.

Her dress fluttered in the wind, her hair swaying, she didn't bother to try and keep it down, she was alone for the night. "Do I.. really want to be… a different person? As in.. as a girl, a battle witch and princess, or as a rockstar.. or even as a professional programmer..? Already, the paths laid out for me look grim but.. I see.. my life is as stressful as it has been before. I genuinely wish that.. I didn't have to follow anyone." Mijo shaked her head. "No. More like.. I just.. don't trust anyone.. my parents? Do I feel.. love?" Mijo sighs, she doesn't want to keep confronting her pain, but in her mind, she had to, but.. it had to be alone, any interruption.. would be disastrous.

A message buzzed on her phone, she walked over to read it, but it's just her mother reminding her to fall asleep for the next day, but.. she couldn't stop. If she did, she would go more.. erratic, and disastrous. She knows that the only reason she hasn't been forced to is because as a child she hated it, and would kick and scream every time. Sometimes even faking to sleep, even though she was awake, and would be aware of her surroundings.

"I hate... my life." said Mijo, almost regretting saying something she feels is undeserving of her as a somewhat well off kid that got a lot of stuff she wanted, a computer, a lot of toys, heck.. even had time to worry about stuff that isn't food or shelter, but.. as these thoughts flooded her mind she wondered if there was any true happiness to get anywhere. "If I'm poor.. I won't have food.. If I'm working-class.. I have food, but have to navigate a system that has shown it prioritizes rigidness and comformity more than humanity.. If I'm rich, I'm part of that system, and have to contend with the pressure to conform, and to further the pursuit of wealth. But.. I know it doesn't have to be this way, and no matter what accepting I do, there's no denying it has hurt me." said Mijo, as she looked at her hands, the hands that held a sword to fight monsters, but also the hands that have typed away for hours, mindlessly doing school work like a robot.

But, these hands have also written diaries of her adventures, her moments in magic and the rare leisure of school activities. She would note about how her friends always had fascination with videogames, or how this boy managed to secure a girlfriend.. Any typical high school stuff, she thinks, but it's those things that make up how you would perceive it, years back. "I remember a lot of things that made me genuinely happy. None of those feature anything about academics or military-related things that have been propped up in school." commented Mijo, as she picked up her written diary, a backup if the digital age collapsed and all data in her devices go unreadable.

She flipped through it, seeing the random writings she had about random writing types, random songs, random translations, random language facts, anything she wanted to physically write about, it was there. But then, she flipped more, she found the things that were also important to her core. The photos containing images of former and current friends flashed before her eyes, like she can feel how she felt when she interacted with them. Then, the writings.. The writings that she dreaded to see, she could not feel anything but horrible and dread when she sees it, it displays her raw emotions, no sugar coating, no hiding.. just what she felt and had to write.

"This is when.. I was listening to the teacher about grades, after the grading sheet was shown the day before that, I was.. dissapointed to say the least. It just confirmed my worst fears, and exasperated my worsening self-confidence and anxiety. I felt.. like I was failing to fulfill not just everyone's expectations, but also myself. I felt that.. it was a repeat of last year, where I didn't get the 'honors' that the school gives out to people who went above 90.." explained Mijo, disassociated from the event, as she looks back upon it.

She flipped another page, this time, it was about the one thing that prevented her from truly living her life. "Citizen's Army Training. Or whatever the fuck they call it now." This is the first time she felt cursing was valid to use when all it took for her mask to break and never be repaired was when a military club was forced upon the students like a cancer that is noticed but never treated. "This.. The words I say aren't enough to say how much my mental health has gone down to the pits of fiery hell due to a single program that I couldn't escape, I couldn't do anything about. The pain never went away, even as old failed tasks go to the wind.. This one institution built upon militaristic duties to a science high school is what further led me to realize that everything I see that people defend had flaws that were sweeped under the rug." continued Mijo, as she felt a headache start to appear, but she had to continue, for if she doesn't address it, she would only to continue to hurt herself more than she already had done.

"These pages of.. hatred and vitriol.. are in the same line as.. accepting death of suicide due to the failure to pass due to the club being mandatory." said Mijo as she felt her headache throb more, but she couldn't stop, the feeling was going to go away, but the trauma won't. "My writings.. they show how I felt isolated, ignored, and unheard as I consciously knew that by rejecting the assignment that they assigned for that quarter, this would lead me to fail the school year. I know of hardships in getting the entire batch to sign these so-called 'officer' signature. Yet, no one has cared. No one had called out this injustice. In fact, it seemed to only invade and permeate the academic side." explained Mijo, as her headache made her hazy and unfocused as she closed the notebook and put it back on the table. She sat on a comfy chair nearby, looking around her as the headache worsened.

"I.. don't want to stop.. but my brain.. my brain wants me to stop..  I'll probably fall asleep due to this.. It won't even stop me from not going to school, it'll magically heal and I would not have any choice in that matter." muttered Mijo, as she stared off to the view of the balcony and sighing. "No matter who I am.. A boy, a girl.. a rockstar... a programmer.. an artist.. a succubi even.. my personality and backstory will remain the same if.. if.. my real life problems don't stop." said Mijo, as she picked up a paper fan, with the design of her favorite videogame anime characters.

She rigorously used it on herself as she felt heat permeate her body, but to no avail. She eventually got tired and put it down, as her whole body begins to stop responding to her movements. "I hate tommorrow.. I hate my past.. But, I guess.. I'm truly just going to have to suffer.. my life.. ending.. like no other.. God.. help me.." murmured Mijo, before closing her eyes, letting the haze of overwhelming pain take her to a darkness she craved.

Mijo goes to a balcony he seems so familiar with, all these moments, all the months of reflecting, they all happened here. "Tackling these issues without a true purpose.." said Mijo to herself, as she sighed and picked up her old glasses, an old remnant of a Mijo long gone.

"I.. can't breathe. I feel.. as if my life is built against me, and.. I'm starting to understand why." said Mijo, as she looked at her glasses, little dust and faint scratches remained, she was itching to fix it, but then she would have to get the eyeglass cleaner, which would take a long time, so she didn't. She simply placed it back down.

"No restrictions." said Mijo to herself, as she let her hair loose, it fluttering in the air along with the dress she wore, the wind was howling this night. "Looking back, I've always thought that.. well my parents were.. fine. Not excellent. Not great. Just.. okay. It's like.. you know how you can take care of a dog, feed it and do all of it's basic necessities, but to really accomodate it, you must devote a lot of time?" asked Mijo, as she grabbed some orange-flavored soft drink RoyalCo to drink.

"I think I was let loose before, when I had no.. well, small obligations in life as a child. Then afterwards in school elementary.. I don't remember much now.. But, if childhood trauma were to have happened, it would've been there.. But of course, as the person experienceing a complex post traumatic stress disorder, I wouldn't remember it all that well, would I?" continued Mijo, drinking more RoyalCo. "At this point, it just feels as though, I need to.. just.. rest.. and don't put as much pressure on myself, but.. you can never just.. I don't know if I ever had self-confidence." 

Mijo sighs. "All my life, or.. as far as I can remember, I feel as if I lived as an impostor, always.. hiding my true self, or.. doing something that I know won't do well, but does anyway.. It's just.. It was worsened by high school.. And I don't know how to express it. Asking an autistic, inattentive, and traumatized person to talk about their issues, is like asking a magikarp to jump over the waterfall and become Gyrados. Sure, it's possible, but.. it rarely happens and is hard to do." said Mijo, summoning a pen to chew on.

"I don't know why I remain like this.. trapped in my own mind. I need to break out of it, to at least listen to what other people.. no. I think that'll make me worse. The trauma from just.. being forced to do something, I think is a key thing in a lot of stuff that has permanently been scarred on my life. Elementary? Probably some discipline or comformist schtick that I internalized and took to high school. Once there, I felt.. isolated again. Like, seriously. Sure, over time I developed a friendship in a group setting, but it feels as though, somehow or someway they preferred not talking to me." continued Mijo, stretching her arms and legs.

"Then.. the lectures followed, the usual things about stuff.. Well, it's like this, sometimes, I feel as though some event affects me more than it should have. For example, last year.. and in a lot of group settings, even now.. I feel as if I'm not actually important to the group. I did not belong, and I knew it was true. Gosh, just talking about these stuff without hurting my head is not going to happen huh? I already feel the haze." said Mijo, drinking more RoyalCo, and brushing her hair.

"My main problem.. At least, right now.. Is the self-contradiction that I have been presented with, I'm supposed to dissociate from my perspective. As a suspected trans woman.. Well, I can switch forms any time I want, I just prefer the girl version.. Hating on a trans athlete while literally being the trans person is.. head dizzying. I can't even build passion because I feel tired. I feel that it will fail me anyway due to the stuff I did consequentially. Like, there's literally no way to stop a cycle that starts and ends without an interruption to the things that power the cycle. Like, very sleepy Mijo.. is because no sleep today, means crashout night next time." Mijo drinks more, soothing her ever growing problems.

"I should go back here tommorrow.. I need some rest, and.. I still need to finish something." said Mijo, before leaving the balcony.

_One day later, at night again_

"So.. I'm here. One day from this.. incident. I don't know. I feel uncomfortable being here. It's as if my most traumatic memories come back, due to me coping here a lot." said Mijo, as she looked around her, looking up to the sky, only to see clouds, and only a lonely star shining. "I'm guessing that's the equivalent of the venus star on the light world here.  I should ask Jomi, but.. I don't.. want to exasperate my.. dysphoria of things." said Mijo, her eyes already wanting to close. "I.. see that I am still.. myself." continued Mijo, as she combed her hair using her hands.

"I.. realize. I.. just.. had unprocessed trauma and fight mode on during that day. The one that triggered my panic attack and mental breakdown. Yes, I had a headache, but it was a combination of a lot of factors, mainly my mental issues that made me less sleepy. I don't think I had the ability to force myself to not sleep until I stayed off the night, my mind completely broken." said Mijo, as she shuddered, the cold wind feeling colder to her.

"Jomi. She.. she's great. But, sometimes..  I truly need myself to really change. I accept her help, I need it even. But, in these.. memories, I can't adequately express how lost I am, like I need someone to dive in with me, and protect me from harm from myself, and resassure me, fight all the demons. But, that.. usually requires sealing magic which I haven't learnt or even asked if it exists. Probably does, no one has used it yet though." said Mijo, before shaking her head. "Oh gosh.. Getting distracted again, and I wonder why I feel stupid, no one ever validated my observations of myself for 2 years about **autism** and **inattentive adhd..**" commented Mijo, before sighing again, she expects she would do it like that.

"Times like these.. you wonder if they even exist anymore. Life is filled with so much distractions.. Especially with my condition. I mean, not even just the fact I might have a chronic so-called disorder, but also the trauma. Like okay, so imagine you're already predisposed to not be always an attentive person.. then you also have trauma working with the thing you are going to do. You're screwed. right? You literally can't help if something gets on your nerves, it's just people learn to hide it or embrace it, depending on who they're talking to. The problem is, I've been internalizing pain for so long I've broken that. Like either I just get that emotion right now and express it, usually more family or friends. But if it's someone I don't know well, it just.. builds up until you find someone you're familiar with that can take your outburst." explained Mijo, as she drank some iced coffee float nearby.

"Mijo? I know you said you needed some space, but it's getting late.. I know.. I know how much you hate getting reminded, but.. I'm just concerned." said Jomi, behind Mijo, surprsing her a bit. "Concerned? I know you are. Why wouldn't you be? If you weren't concerned then I'd reconsider our entire relationship." Mijo says boldly, she has no filter this time, even if it hurts her to say it directly. "I.." said Jomi, taken aback a bit. Mijo immediately regretted what she said, but she couldn't take the words back and so sighed and turned away, already feeling the thoughts of shame and guilt creeping in. "So.. you know I'd be concerned with you, but.. why.. go that far?" asked Jomi, as Mijo's tears swelled up again. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, **Jomi**. I just.. don't.. I can't manage my emotions anymore.. I feel like I snap at everyone, so I don't approach **Rhida** anymore. I hide myself into a mask with **Ikari** and **Urda**. Then, I burst! I need help.. but I'm not sure if I just.. need time alone, or.. or.. someone else helps me, it's just I don't know what they **can** do." said Mijo, stuttering and mumbling in-between her words, her hands on her eyes.

**Jomi** is silent as she approaches Mijo leaning on the railings, with tears in her eyes. "Please. I.. am so sorry, but please.. *leave*." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "*Got it.* You're not done with exams just yet though. I'll help you there, but for now.. I'll let you be, my Mijo." said Jomi, before Mijo watches her leave. 

"I.. need time. I just meed time with myself. But.. it's just so hard.. to.. be.. so.. it's like, when you're in a state, for example, my school brain is completely hot wired differently to my actual brain. I am often the shy introvert one, but in my inner circle, I'm the explosive, impulsive, and destructive one. Cognitiive dissonance, dissociation, whatever you call it, it's having two completely.. different persona you have to keep up. I am fine doing it outside of my alone or house. But.. really, it's when you interrupt me in my private moments that I get overtly irrational and emotional. It's like interrupting someone from nailing that last coffin, or someone drawing a really good anime frame. You're going to feel bummed out right? What if you were dealing with yourself, as in past, present and future thoughts? What if someone just decides to walk in and start talking.. And even worse if you're not comfortable with sharing, or just can't! It's like.. ugh. I would say something curse word with an angry tone, but just thinking of when I did that, gives me a more intense headache than I already get." continued Mijo, as she looked around her, still paranoid Jomi was listening.

"Still.. I need to do something. I feel my heart is still heavy at making Jomi leave. Do I regret it? No. But, I just wished I didn't need it." added Mijo, as she still felt eyes looking at her, she feels this overwhelming paranoia and dread. "Oh right. I remember where my backpack that hosts.. this world. Often, I would just rest, and think about stuff when one of the two.. adults I tolerate, and tolerate me, head to remind and **'nag'.** I feel myself dissociating from them like I am not their child. I still don't know if I love them." said Mijo, as she sighs and looks at her phone. "Would ya look at that, dad and mom want me to go back and have a chat. Yeah screw that. I've faced enough trauma for today, I'm going to sleep. I've already reviewed some key points, and then I can wake up, continue that. Okay, settled." added Mijo, before leaving the balcony again.

_Next night_

"I.. have nothing to talk about. At least, none that I have talked about before." said Mijo, as she played with her hair, her finger twirling to make a lock. "Well.. Either way, I have to study, then continue exams tomorrow. I feel like I have poured my heart out in here for the last couple of days to end up here. I think.. I deserve this break." continued Mijo, as she smiled, her hair and dress fluttering through the wind, immersing her in the cold embrace of the night.

Mijo chills there, letting her mind wander for a while before sighing. "Welp. Time to go back, let's do this. One more day, then recovery. Then next week.. Next week, we shall see." said Mijo, as she brushes her hair and leaves the balcony.

_Another night_

"Well.. it appears I have something to talk about. At least before I.. uh.. well.. I'm writing these in the diary notebook thing, and I kinda want to move on. The thing is, I just *feel* that I am either blocking the trauma, or feel a lot of misery and anguish in one moment that it leads to an outburst or collapse. Honestly depends on how it appeared. But anyway, I'm ending it off here. There's more bad things that are going to happen soon, and I just want to move on with my life. My life isn't good. But, after all.. There's not much I can do to stem the inevitable destruction of the islands due to climate change, or the poverty that'll follow." said Mijo, as she sighed and closed her eyes, feeling the wind breeze. "I.. I'll continue. At least the hardest parts are over. For now..." continued Mijo, before going to sit down on a chair and letting her head rest, as the wind blows through the night.

_The End?_
