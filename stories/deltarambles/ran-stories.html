Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:

Leviente dirst

Summary: 

Author's Note: A student kills every darkner in the dark world lol. Also no relation to Canon Mijo btw.

Mijo wakes up after falling into a dark world in the classroom, he sees his student uniform worn down, and only a revolver with around enough ammo to survive for a day or so. 

Mijo said, "Ah shit, I'm screwed. I only have a revolver, at yun lang. Sana makakita ako ng ibang tao..."

So he got up and walked.. At first the darkness was... calming but soon it turned into dread as sound everywhere of something. Then he saw a huge field, filled with computer setups that have cabinets. 

He jumped down there and immediately a monster started attacking him and so he shot it but the monster relented. Mijo was knocked and hit a bunch of the setups, he kept shooting at the monster, but he was eventually knocked down and was about to die until...

Jamise shouted, "Hey! Get away from my Friend!!!" before shooting the monster and the monster decided to chase her instead.

Mijo was so hurt that he began to drift away to unconsciousness until a certain voice called out to him.

Urda said, "Yo, don't die on me Mijo, aalis tayo dito kasama ang lahat, yun yung sinabi ni Jamise sakin.." then she healed him. 

Barely enough that Mijo can walk because her magic was exhausted as well.

Mijo said, "Thanks. Jamise would do that huh, well we should go. Gusto ko din umalis bro.."

So Mijo got up and walked with Urda towards Jamise where she was fighting with the monster.

Jamise shouted, "Mamatay ka!! Putang inang halimaw!" before shooting the monster until it was dead.

'Hey,

"I am staying here. You don't have a clue on
how the Light World works." said Mijo.

"I'm just saying, you can survive the light world right?" said Jomi.

"No. The Light world sucks, it just is." said Mijo.

"Mijo, I'm concerned with what you are thinking about here, isn't the light world fun too?" said Jomi.

"You know, why I'm here, but incase you haven't thought much about it, I AM DONE WITH LIFE ON THE LIGHT WORLD. SCHOOL, hurts. The STRESS AND PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW- I WANNA ENJOY the world here." said Mijo.

"But Mijo, please, just let her go by closing the portal." said Jomi.

"No, NO! She can go off on her own, that's fine, you CAN teach her right? Just let her go then. I will be staying here. For the future." said Mijo.

"Well, Mijo, it will be unfavorable to both of you, if you guys get separated in the worlds, trust me." said Jomi.

"I Guess, but I dont wanna go back out there, where problems are way harder, just staying here is good enough for me." said Mijo.

"I understand, but this isn't your world. You belong there, its like with me but in the light world. You can have as much fun as you want here but you have to go back, don't you have friends to talk to?" said Jomi.

"I... do. But they don't need me. They do fine on their own, i wanna stay here. Even if that means forever locking the lithium room." said Mijo.

"I... can't let you do that, I'm.. you and you are me, you know this isn't right." said Jomi.

"Well, then I will just have to go out myself." said Mijo before drawing his sword.

"Look, i don't wanna fight but if you want to... i can." said Jomi before drawing her sword.

"OK OK LETS DO THIS!!!" said Mijo before attacking.

They fought but eventually Jomi was defeated with a surprise scabbard to the stomach.

"Hah... That was fun. But I have to go, to new areas. Good luck! I know you'll survive, and I'll meet you again!" said Mijo, before walking away, towards the gate that leads to the grass outside.

"Jomi!" shouted Ikari, from the fountain room.

"Are you fine? Are you ok?" said Ikari, worried.

"I'm fine, i have healing powers. Just go after him, before he does something rash." said Jomi pointing to her hand with a green glow.

"UH, are you sure I can take him, I mean you got defeated right here!" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I don't know. Find. Out. I can't really get you out of here without him, so... Good Luck?"
said Jomi, clearly having her fingers crossed.

"Uh, sige, mamatay naman din ako anyway, uh sasama ka ba?" said Ikari.

"Soon. I guess you can fight hanggang makapunta ako." said Jomi.

"Ok... See ya'!" said Ikari before going to the same door that Mijo went.

<!--Attempt at Fight Scene-->
<p id="R4"><md-block># Random DR Fight</md-block></p>

One day, in the Playas Cemetery....

"I... don't know what to say, honestly.." said Mijo.

"Yeah, guess so, but you can get the advice of our dead family over here." said Jomi.

"What? But I have my parents right there!" said Mijo, pointing to his parents.

"Can they even see me?" said Jomi.

"Oh definitely, I just said that you were a friend in school that also went here." said Mijo.

"Right, and they won't notice the... similarities?" said Jomi.

"Think so, i'll just say it's a coincidence, and besides, no one will look that far unless they're my friends..." said Mijo.

"Ok... and they won't notice how I have no parents or where they even are???" said Jomi.

"Relax... We're here to talk about life and.. Her. Don't worry, I gooot this. If I need help, I'll ask you, ok?" said Mijo.

"Alright, alright, I don't trust you, but you are the only one that can do anything about that, anyways, so-" said Jomi,

Before a large dark fountain opened right in the center of the cemetery, Mijo and Jomi quickly rushed to see what was happening, but got sucked into the dark world before seeing the fountain opener. They landed at the part where the fountain was, but it was basically the cemetery but dark, so off they go exploring again.

"Ah shit, didn't got time to-" said Mijo.

"Ok, relax Mijo, it's just a dark world, the only thing we need to do is quickly close it, so nothing significant happens." said Jomi.

"Good point, but if the fountain isn't here then..." said Mijo, thinking then he said, "Maybe..." before getting cut off by Jomi.

"Oh, its right there!" Jomi points to the fountain near where they were just talking in the light world.

"Sweet, it's one of those easy ones." said Mijo.

They quickly rushed to the fountain and as Mijo was closing it, someone blasted Mijo away from the fountain.

"Oof, sino ka!" said Mijo as he gets up.

"Hahaha... What's up!" said someone.

"Wait, you are... Cajo!" said Jomi.

"Who the fuck is Cajo?" said Mijo.

"Let me introduce myself, so you know how those dark fountains open without you? That's me!" said Cajo.

"What? No, that was Doctor G and Cara right?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, and I work with them, I opened those, not them." said Cajo.

"Ok... Who are you, lightner? darkner? Just who are you exactly?" said Mijo.

"Oh, uh... I come from nowhere!" said Cajo.

"Really, you can't even say where you even come from?" said Jomi.

"WHAT? Do you know me?" said Cajo.

"Well actually yes, you are Cajo, the lightner that was dissatisfied... I guess you got broken out by those two..." said Jomi.

"Oh, OH! YOU... You. Ikaw ah... Papatayin ko kita ngayon!!" said Cajo.

"Nope, not on my watch." said Mijo.

"Ok, Mijo. LET'S DANCE!" said Cajo.

<!--FEB 29 SPINOFF FUN SHORT LORE BREAK-->
<p id="R5"><md-block># DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark</md-block></p>

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after S1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!

<!--IDEA 16 made into an actual spinoff-->
<p id="R6"><md-block># DeltaRambles: It's Magic Time</md-block></p>

## Summary: 

When there's an important event to go to, especially where his friends are, Mijo tries magic but things go unexpected and he still has to go to the event.

## Author's Note: 

This _definitely_ doesn't say anything about me, it's just a fun idea turned into an actual story that I did because it would be fun to see this happen, might be canon, but you'll see.. anyways enjoy!

Edit 1: It has implicit sexual things, since I don't want to write one but it is the natural progression of things, so keep that in mind!

Edit 2: Oh god this is just the outline of c4s2, well as I said _**might**_ be canon, I have taken some creative liberties with this one.

Edit 3: Shit, this is starting to be my main plot, i need help.

————————————————————————————

On the day before student's night, at Jomi's library, where Mijo was sifting through some books.

"Aha! I knew it! It exists!" said Mijo before Jomi surprises him.

"What exists?" said Jomi as Mijo jumps in surprise.

"Wha— You're here?! Um, no, nothing, yeah.." said Mijo as he closed the book.

"Hmm, that book is for transfiguration.. What are you thinking..?" said Jomi, as Mijo tries to return the books quietly.

"Uhh— nothing that _you_ are thinking of! Um, I'll be going to the.. training ground! Yep. Just—" said Mijo before Jomi stops him.

"Be honest, the student night is tomorrow and you are searching for magic that can modify your looks. Right?" said Jomi, as Mijo embarrassed, nodded.

"Alright, look, Don't try to hide anything from me, because.. I know you, you keep forgetting that—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah... I am not stupid, I just.. wanted to do this by myself you know? Like it's a surprise!"

"And? You can't just go to me and teach you, even though I'll make fun of you, I'll still help you, you know?" said Jomi, as Mijo took the book about transfiguration back from the bookshelf.

"Ok. But, you're always busy! Like, I just don't wanna disturb you in any of your work, like I would do in your situation." said Mijo, now finding that specific page.

"Hmm, you know too that I would help anyways, right? But, anyway... Since it's a special day tomorrow anyway here in the dark world too, I put some of the workload to my subjects. I still did my work, I am just on my break now, and went to see you." said Jomi as Mijo agrees and shows her the page.

"This, this one specifically. I wanna make a special form I can use and hide anytime." said Mijo, as Jomi carefully inspects the page.

"Transfiguration #4.1"
As with this magic, you can use transfiguration to turn yourself into anything you can imagine and design, current testing shows you can only modify yourself, and while lookalikes are possible, you cannot maintain them for long, as you have to use your own magic, and if it is far from your own look, it will also be more. An exception is for the different versions of yourself that you automatically have based on your genetics (**sex**, height, eye and hair colour; etc)...

"Oh, did you highlight the one with.. sex? Hey, hold on.. Oh no, I know what you're going to do.." said Jomi as Mijo is now awkwardly smiling.

"Yep... I also want to modify my clothing so that it can turn into a dress that I can wear, ya know for more effort?" said Mijo, as Jomi is genuinely thinking about the whole logistics.

"Uh.. sure. Let's go to my lab." said Jomi, before Mijo said, "Wait you have a lab?!" 

"Yeah. What? Where do you think I get my potions and random stuff I give? Stealing? Well, I refine stuff there.. Anyways let's go there." said Jomi, before they walked to the lab behind Jomi's desk near her throne room.

"Huh, you have a separate desk and throne? That's weird." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and they kept going to her lab.

"Welcome, to my lab! Stay here, I think I have a potion for this..." said Jomi, as she went to her potion storage to find the transfiguration potion she needed.

"Uh sure. I am just gonna look then." said Mijo, as Jomi searched through her collection. She went up, middle, down, until she found a heart-shaped potion with an eagle-shaped gem decoration that had a blend of pink and red liquid.

"Alright, here. This should do the trick." said Jomi as she gave the potion to Mijo before Mijo accidentally spilled it on himself.

"AH! SORRY! Um, what's happening to me..?!" said Mijo, as the liquid was absorbed into his body and he turned into the female version of himself, a Jomi that was wearing full gear, with a dress for some reason.

"Ooooh, interesting... Um, sorry for.. um laughing.. Hahaha.." said Jomi, as she picked up one of her notebooks and wrote down what happened to Mijo.

"Heh? Wait! I thought that I was supposed to have a way to change it, and.. this looks permanent!" said Mijo, as he now looks upon his changed body.

"Hahaha.. This is why, you don't spill these types of potions.. Anywho, I still need to fix your mistake, soo wait.." said Jomi, as Mijo silently watches Jomi pick out a notebook she had that she started silently reading.

"Hmmm, hey can you do me a favor and go to the light world with this.. form? Umm, try to improvise i guess.." said Jomi, as she flips another page.

"Uh.. um.. you sure I can act like you?" said Mijo, as Jomi looked at Mijo and smiled and nodded.

"Uh ok.. Um do I have to go into the lab again afterwards?" said Mijo, as Jomi now puts the book back down.

"No... Just, go near my desk, I still have stuff to do.. So after I make this I'll just be at my desk." said Jomi, as she picked out a container.

"Um.. Ok. I am only doing this because I am also curious ok? I am going now.." said Mijo as Jomi laughed and nodded as she grabbed a gem-based design, with a narrow mouth and wide body.

"Uh.. Ahem.. I gotta be as fast as possible, huh.. no heels.. great! I am just gonna run as fast as I can.. _Hopefully_ nobody notices." said Mijo, as he ran with a dress that didn't interfere with his legs but still slowed him down due to his new form.

"Hey! Jomi!" called JR to an unsuspecting Mijo, now a lookalike of Jomi in anything but clothes.

"Uh.. Yes?" said Mijo, trying to sound like Jomi.

"Uh, do you know where Mijo is? I wanna talk with him about something.." said JR, looking like he has a lot to say.

"Ah— Him? He.. He's probably at the library.. Check there!" said Mijo, as he awkwardly stared at JR, waiting for his response.

"Hmm, ok! He always goes there whenever he's not at the training grounds.. Anyways, see ya!" said JR, as Mijo also said, "See ya!" to JR.

"Whew, Um.. That was unexpected so I gotta go, quick before anybody notices!" said Mijo as he traveled further down to the light world connector and got transported to the light world, seeing Rhida chilling near the entrance. Mijo now looks like a schoolgirl with a tie and dress, just like how a typical female student would of Honrato Pez.

"Oh, hi— Uh, who are you? Um wait—" said Rhida, as Mijo awkwardly waves at her and says, "Oh, ah— I am.. Jomi? Yeah.."

"You're Jomi? Wait, aren't you—" said Rhida before Mijo interrupted, "Yes, I am still the pink notebook, just um.. I have the special properties of being able to have this form while outside the dark world, yeah!"

"Oooh, you haven't told me that.. Interesting, so I can bring you with me tomorrow, or even later??" said Rhida, as Mijo tries hard to get out of the conversation.

"Um.. No, I still have important stuff to do in the dark world, I just.. wanted to test something, for more details, ask Mijo about it later!" said Mijo, as he tries desperately to go back to the dark world secretly.

"Oooh! Ok I am sure it's _very_ important so I'll leave you and Mijo to do it, remember our deal!"  said Rhida, as she continued browsing through her phone.

"Ah, thanks! I'll be going now!" said Mijo, as he finally went back, thinking what deal Jomi made and how Jomi and her were on good terms, even before she went to him, and after the incident during the previous cataclysm.

"Uh.. I'll ask Jomi later, anyways, it's pretty clear what happened, I have to go, now!" said Mijo, as he ran as fast as possible to Jomi's desk.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's desk*

Jomi was humming something as she managed her government papers, as JR entered her hall with a door connecting her lab, throne room and library.

"Woah! Jomi? I thought you were outside or something and, didn't you have like.. your battle gear on? Why do you _still_ have your... mayor suit?" said JR, as Jomi stops humming and looks at JR, surprised.

"Wha— Oh. Uh, right. Um, I just switched out of them, yeah. I am just sorting some documents now." said Jomi, surprised but understanding the situation.

"Uhuh, anyways is Mijo still behind this library? I still have something to say to him." said JR, as  Jomi nodded and JR proceeded to go in the library, closing the door behind him.

Then Mijo appeared, opening the door leading to the hall, and was heavily breathing, and shouted to Jomi, "Jomi! Jomi! We *need* to go into your lab, *now!"*

"Haha, lets be quick, JR is waiting behind that door..!" said Jomi, pointing to the library door before Mijo rushed into her lab, as Jomi follows closely and closes the door.

"Aight, you sure you want your old body back? You could just forego your old identity haha.." said Jomi sarcastically as she grabbed the potion from earlier that she made.

"Yes, of course! Wh— I mean, I still need to attend school and I can't exactly register you as a student so—" answered Mijo, before Jomi suddenlt gives him the potion. "Yeah, yeah I am joking, I wouldn't wanna know how that works, anyway.." said Jomi, before Mijo drank the potion and afterwards, put it in a nearby table. "This is a temporary fix, since developing the potion that instantly changes clothes and body, et cetera.. Takes more time, so what I am doing is using your current clothes, but you change form depending on.. your glasses!"

"Wha— My glasses..? So, like.. woah!" said Mijo before he suddenly changed form to his old self, with his usual dark world clothing. "So.. If I understand correctly, my.. other form is my actual body, and this is like a disguise for now?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "Yep, that means if you even separate yourself from your glasses, you'll turn to a girl! This is the price you pay for ruining my glass, now I'll actually have to steal from someone haha.."

"Don't! So, like.. How long does this.. potion take to make?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi cleans the potion and puts it back in the empty containers. "Hmm, I'll tell you when it's done, now get out, JR's waiting for you lol." answered Jomi, as she pushes Mijo out and closes the lab door. "Hey! You use lol IRL?! Bruh—" said Mijo to the lab door, as JR pats his back to get his attention.

"H—huh? Oh, hi..! I was just talking with Jomi about a book I found, what do you want..?" asked Mijo, as JR looks at him with disapproval before saying, "Uhuh.. Anyway, I have to talk to you about something.. Is she going out of that.. back room of hers?"

"Uh.. probably? Let's talk in the library then." said Mijo, just as they walked to the library and headed for a nearby seating.

"So, is there any reason why you haven't been out of the library for.. the entirety of the intramurals? Like, after that day, whenever I asked Jomi where were you, she said here, so I am simply curious.. What are you studying, maybe I can help..?" asked JR, as Mijo tries to hide his embarrassment at his words. "Oh.. yeah.. Sorry, just kinda busy, y'know.. Abyss Doctor stuff, so I have just been preparing.. I mean, I do go out, just not when you're around I guess.." answered Mijo, as he looks over at the part near the transfiguration book.

"Hmm..? Alright, yeah.. the abyss doctor.. I wonder when he'll come back... Well, that's... Hm... Sige, I'll leave you to it. Pag kailangan mo, we're here. Anyways, this new mushroom based attack, Imma see if I can do it.." said JR, as he stood up and left the library. "Good luck! *sigh* Now what.. I am basically a different person inside.. Ugh.. How does it even work..? Like, is it frozen in time or something.. or.. I don't even want to know.." mutterred Mijo to himself as he contemplated his life decisions.

"Hey! Mijo! Our daily sparring match? Did you forget?" asked Urda, as she entered the library. "O—oh! Yeah, lets go." responded Mijo, as he walked up to her and they walked to the training ground.

"Same as before, magic healthbar and no holding back, ok?" said Urda, as they prepared their weapons. "Alright, let's dance!" shouted Mijo, before they started their spar with Urda pressing a button to do so.

First, Mijo acted first slashing his way near Urda, before stunning her with his summoning slashes, as he follows it up with a slash up, so she gets knocked up, and as she is up, he quickly slashes her as he brings her down. Then he quickly teleports away, as before she could act, he managed to get a few more slashes in. Urda decides to use her gun to fire projectiles at Mijo, as he teleports and dodges all of them, as he gets the jump at Urda, quickly slashing her as Urda tries to block. Then he comes back and keeps putting pressure as she is unable to act as he keeps slashing and stabbing her. As he moves away, Urda decides to use her gun to blast in his general direction, he easily dodges and manages to keep bringing her healthbar down. Then as Urda decides to use wind to keep herself up and to block his shots, he decides to use his ultimate and break through space to deal a lot of damage. She falls down and Mijo deals a lot of damage to her as she is stunned by this amount of damage, by using his big sword and enhanced unarmed combat wear. Then as she finally has a chance to breathe, he uses his ultimate again, finishing the spar with him winning. 

"Haha.. you uh.. having a good day today.. I guess.. Whew.. And this close to student's night.." said Urda, as she sits down at the ground, exhausted. "Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I was that perfect, anyways.. What.. else..?" responded Mijo, as he also sits down, tired.

"I don't know, honestly.. Wanna get some food? Our spars just consume a lot of our energy.. so yeah." asked Urda, with a bit of hesitation. "Honestly, what time even is it.. I was so caught up with.. everything.. Just in general, abyss doctor stuff, my personal stuff, the school stuff, a lot.." said Mijo, not answering her question.

"Uh.. it's.. 2:30 PM in the light world.. What's on your mind, you can tell me... I won't judge!" said  Urda reassuringly, as she moves closer to him.
"Uh.. well, it's a secret, ok? I.. really am embarrassed about it.. I just don't wanna say _anything_ about it.." responded Mijo, as he tries to stay composed.

"Are you suuure..? I basically know most of your secrets, like Jomi.. Rhida.. you know what I mean." asked Urda, as she persistently bothers Mijo about it. " *sigh* Fiiine. Hold on, lemme stand up." said Mijo, acquiescing to her request. So he stood up, walked a few steps away from her and took off his glasses to reveal his actual form, with longer hair to the shoulder, a bigger chest area, and a more feminine body type, like Jomi's but with a bit more muscle.

"W—woah!! Are you actually Jomi?" questioned Urda, before Jomi appeared behind her, answering "Maybe..!", as she jumps up and sees the two, the only difference between them being how they style themselves. With Jomi, a more formal and royal purple look, while Mijo with his usual dark red and blue contrasting each other with a rough look.

"H—huh?! Two Jomis?!" questioned Urda, as Mijo wore his glasses again, turning him back to this 'old self'. "No.. Just a lil' magic that Mijo personally requested.. Anyways, I am going.. I just wanted to _check in..!_ " answered Jomi before she left, her steps being noticed by the other two.

"O—oh, whew.. Wait.. what magic?!" shouted Urda, before Jomi was far enough to not hear or see them. "Transformation Magic... That's what I've been busy with for a few days.. actually." answered Mijo, as Urda gasped at this answer. "No way..! So that's what you've been doing in the library! What's the reason..?" asked Urda, as Mijo comes closer to Urda.

"Just.. an experiment, that's all! I swear." said Mijo, as Urda chuckles. "Really..? Are you suure? Because I think there's a lot more to this than you say.." said Urda, teasing him again. "I am sure, alright.. one more round?" responded Mijo, standing up again.

"Haha.. Sure, but I want your girl form, deal?" said Urda, before Mijo reluctantly nodded and took off his glasses. "My glasses are for style points anyway, since getting this new form I have been able to see without it." responded Mijo, before he got his weapons ready.

"Coool, I should look into it, then." said Urda, as she started the spar, with health bars popping up.

They have a standoff as they look at each other intently for a while, before Mijo makes the first move, starting with his big slash using his big sword to slash as it gets deflected by Urda. Then he jumps high to the air and summons slashes against Urda as he does a big final slash, as he manages to get a small knock back as he lands. Suddenly Urda's blade clashed with Mijo's as he was knocked back and managed to backflip as he landed on his feet as he was knocked into the air and knocked back down with a combo from Urda. He then managed to switch to his other sword as he deflected a follow up attack and countered as he maintained his ground. Then they locked blades as they looked at each other intently before a quick deflect from Mijo due to a quick shot from Urda, pushed each other away. They both try to use their own ultimates as the two simultaneously attack each other and as it finishes, Mijo is noticeably lower in health. Urda tries to blast and maneuver Mijo as much as she can, as Mijo dodges, parries and counters her attack. Then Mijo attacks with a very risky move, moving to stab Urda straight at the heart as Urda brings down his health little by little, as he managed to get an opportunity and as she notices, she decides to counter and as the two stab each other in the chest, the game's over with Urda winning the duel.

Heavy breathing from both sides as both pull out their weapons. "Man, if we were just a little more risky, we could have damaged each other for real.." said Mijo, as he lay down on the floor. "Yeah.. Good game to you, but I managed to have enough health to tank that before you lost." responded Urda, as she also sits on the floor.

"Mhmm.. Well, what time is it? It's probably time to go home for today.." asked Mijo, as Urda responded, "Uhh oh, it's 3:30 PM, we should head back, it's a Thursday.. I don't know about you, but our sir is particularly strict, so I gotta go.. See you tomorrow!", as she waves Mijo goodbye as she walks back to enter the light world. He picks up his glasses and starts walking out of the training ground.

"I should head back too, a lot of prep is needed, and I am kinda tired too." muttered Mijo as he walked his way near the exit of the dark world. "Hey~" said Jomi, as she surprises Mijo again with a smile. "H—huh?! Oh, uh.. Jomi.. what do you want?" responded Mijo, as Jomi shows herself in front of him.

"Sooo what do you think..? Any.. complaints?" asked Jomi, as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah, are you done with the potion?"

"No.. I would've told you, anywho... I can see your hesitance and.. conflicted mind. So, I will say that you'll have an... interesting night ahead of you, don't worry.. I am working on it, just see me next week, ok?" responded Jomi, as Mijo sighs heavily and says, "Yeah, yeah.. I am.. just curious, does the.. change of clothes like earlier before the temporary potion, work now?"

"Should be the same, haha.. I can already tell in your eyes what you're thinking, all of it.. Try it, you'll have time to try before tomorrow, and... oh! Yeah, uh.. as for any side effects beside the obvious, this type of magic actually affects _those_ areas, but I'll need more time to figure out specifics, so hey! Why not try everything you've always wanted to try, maybe you'll learn something!" explained Jomi, before winking and gesturing Mijo to leave. "Ugh.. I sure do love and hate having someone like you around.. Anyway, then.. see you next week!" said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other.

As he goes out of the dark world and closes the portal for the next few days, he knows that he can't get there tomorrow and then the weekends too. He goes into their classroom and gets his bag as he sees his friends, Ikari already go out, and Lauvielle talking to somebody else. He then picks up his bag and leaves as his other classmates continue cleaning the room. He then checks the time, and it looks like it's 15:50, as he feels the breeze of the wind. He then looks at his phone, and stares at the home screen, knowing if he presses anything he won't ever get out of the internet spiral. Then his thoughts move on to his notes app, maybe he should start a diary of this, or maybe he should continue that memoir disguised as fantasy fiction of his adventures, but as he thinks of this, a certain JR comes up to him, as he exits the classroom.

"Hey. I have a question, is there going to be a chance to open and close the dark world during the morning, before the preparations for students night eventually take over?" asked JR, as Mijo is snapped out of his thoughts and looks at JR and answers, "Maybe.. I'll try to be early tomorrow, but you know me.. Since I largely don't care about the morning 'year-end party', I can maybe sneak it in before it officially starts.. Urda's probably busy with her class, but she might come up.. we'll see."

"Ok. Goodbye. See you tomorrow!" said JR, as he waved goodbye, going out of Mijo's vision by turning a corner. "Oh, right.. I might not care about the morning, but the night.. People say that.. to enjoy this once-a-year event in school, since you only ever get 6 times before it isn't the same anymore, but.. I.. really have well, no one else to _enjoy_ the night, my friends have their own dance, and the others might either leave or hangout with the others, since they're more.. confident?" muttered Mijo to himself, as he leans on a railing overlooking the school near his room.

"This new body too, Jomi's always vague with her words, but.. can't blame her honestly.. It's something I would do if I saw someone go through my situation. Anyways, times like these.. I always think about it, but.. there's just..  little things that I actually change. Huh.. Time often is wasted away by me, but.. I guess this is technically just waiting for my dad to pick me up, but what I could be doing during that time.. It's so much more than.. now. I think my often self-reflections are good, but then I should do something about it, it gets worse since I don't even share this, at least.. not willingly..." said Mijo to himself, as behind him his classmates finish cleaning, lock the classroom and leave.

"Oh, I should go down, and.. *sigh* Rhida's gone.. Welp, my chance with her is gone, anyways.. anything I want to do isn't until I go home, so imma just play some mobile videogames, like.. oooh! A companion game to Shingen Inpakuto, Honkstar Railway!" said Mijo, as he walked down the stairs as he went to a nearby unofficial waiting area that was just a student hangout place that was coincidentally close to the school gate.

He eventually decided to go and walk home. As he settles down in his bed, as he does the usual change to home clothes. Then he goes to his room that had his computer setup, since his house was built with separate shared bedrooms and other rooms used for work or school-related stuff.

"Whew.. Finally home and I can.. experiment. Hopefully they don't notice, or don't just enter my room without noise, I don't really wanna lock it since I'll have to explain why, and.. hopefully I can get this done and then, rest and watch some videos, play some games, et cetera.." muttered Mijo to himself as he enters another room that's used for extra bed space and storage for other people.

"Ok, first.. The obvious first thing that any person would do if they switched bodies is check.. this." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and then his pajamas. "Uh.. well, I guess I should.." said Mijo, as he took off his shirt.

Meanwhile in the living room, May and June, his parents are talking about work stuff. 

"Then, this girl was complaining about the foods that the campaign manager gave her since the other side had larger portions, while I was just listening intently trying to be discreet in eavesdropping, afterwards we talked about it, it's just another crazy day of government office volunteering.." ranted May, as June remarks, "Yeah, that's just how people are. It's fine, they probably just got irritated by something else.. I don't want to say what that could be, since it could be anything anyway."

"Oh yeah, food's ready. Call our son." said May, before June walks to where Mijo is. 

As Mijo looks at his body, he gets the urge to see what would happen if he touched it.

"Should I..? Should I? I.. don't think there's anything else to do, I can look at the fit of different clothes later. Uh.. oh no.. that's likely dad... I should immediately dress up and confront him, it's likely dinner time.." said Mijo to himself as he quickly dressed back up, hearing his dad walk to his room. Then he sees his dad and greets him, so they can eat dinner.

Then they eat dinner, as he half-heartedly listens to his parents conversation and after a while he finishes his food. He heads off to his room again afterwards and lays down on the floor while listening to a random long video in his recommendation. 

"Ugh... I really should've just went and talked to someone after closing the dark world.. At least then, I'll have something to look forward to, aside from the food and drinks.. of course." said Mijo as he stared at the ceiling. "I could just play videogames, but Urda isn't online.. Neither is Lauvielle nor Ikari.. Hmm.. I should probably figure out what to do, but.. wait!" muttered Mijo, as he jumped up and stood on his feet.

"The experiment hasn't finished yet! Let's head to the other room again." said Mijo to himself as he walked to the other room and closed the door, making sure to lock it, since he shouldn't be expecting anyone. Then he stripped himself again, taking off his clothes and glasses.

"Ok, alright. Uh.. sooo, i mean.. what else is there to do? It doesn't have the same effect as if I either changed form fully or Jomi manages to go out of the dark world, since relatively a few things change, besides inside me but that's easy.. to hide! Anyway, I should just get on with it, since Jomi likely expects me to do this, and.. this is one of the few times that magic is brought to the light world. So, here goes nothing!" said Mijo, as he starts touching himself in the changes around the chest and crotch areas.

"Huh, that's weird. This.. _aroused_ feeling, it's weird. Is it because of my brain, or is it the magic..? I am going to.. lay down on the bed." said Mijo, as he lay down on the bed pushing away his clothes. "Ugh.. Mmm.. I'm going to stop, I've promised myself to not go too far with this, I.. think it's enough. My.. breathing is noticeably faster and so is my heartbeat.. I.. I am gonna pass out." said Mijo, as he unexpectedly closed his eyes due to mixed euphoria and dizziness that he felt. After an hour or two, a knock is heard at the door as May calls on Mijo, "Mijo! Mijo! Your clothes for tomorrow! Try it out!"

"H—huh..? Oh shi.. Right, the students night! Oh no—" said Mijo as he quickly dresses up and gets his glasses, transforming himself back. "Yeah! Coming! Wait a sec!" shouted Mijo back, as May responded, "Ok! I'll be waiting in the living room!"

"Whew.. Uh.. What happened..? One moment, I was just.. exploring and.. uh.. y—you know what, I am just going to ignore that and quickly go to where she is." said Mijo, before he opened the door, grabbed his phone and left to go to the living room.

"So here's the clothes for the year-end party in the morning, then we switch it out with this one for students night in the afternoon until midnight. Try it out!" said May, as she gestured to Mijo to try the first one. Then Mijo tried the first one as he put down his phone nearby, then went to go behind a big dresser cabinet to change as May looked at her phone, waiting for him.

"Oh no.. If she ever gets curious or wants to see me while I don't expect she could see.. welp, no point in dwelling. I just hope I get lucky." said Mijo as he tries his best to quickly change and then he reveals himself, his clothes being specifically picked out due to a theme of dark academia that the officers of his class decided, with a landslide vote for it due to the other themes not being serious.

"Oh wow, look how handsome you are in that style! What do _you_ think of it?" remarked May, as Mijo responds, "Yeah, it's fine i guess. It fits the theme for sure. Imma go try the other one." as he grabs the second one and goes behind the dresser again, and quickly changes to the second style, a dark blue polo with a large coat. Then he reveals this to his mom.

"Wow, even better.. It was a good decision to reuse those school pants since your polo is also dark blue, the coat looks nice but it might be too hot before night." said May, as Mijo nodded and asked, "Is.. that all, including the rice for tomorrow's school day event?"

"Yeah, change back, and I am going to prepare each of them for tomorrow, have fun tomorrow anak!" said May, as Mijo went and changed back and left to go back to his room after grabbing his phone again. "Whew.. Ok, that's done. Now, where were we.. Oh right, the whole.. experiment. What time even is it?" said Mijo, as he checks the time and sees it is 20:30, it is usually when he and Urda played games, but when he checked her profile, she was offline and most likely accidentally fell asleep again.

"Oh, well. Let's go back to experimenting, I better not lose my mind again." said Mijo, as he put down his phone and headed off to the other room. Then he closed the door, locking it again, then undressed again, taking off his clothes and glasses. "Ok, so.. uh.. I am just gonna continue and stop when it affects me, because.. whatever happened earlier, the memories are far too dizzy to be a success in exploring." said Mijo, before he touched himself in the chest and crotch areas again, then after some short somewhat unintentionally sensual touches, he laid down in the bed again, trying to process and stay conscious, with the same effect as before, heavy breathing, faster heartbeat, and subconscious moving on his hips and legs.

"Wha— What..? Why.. Is this... I.. ugh.. I am going to.. mmm.. just try to stay still, and.. yeah.." said Mijo, as he tried to stay conscious and experience the euphoria of pleasure as well as the overwhelming sense of dizziness from the sudden experience. "Whew.. Come on, stay determined.. Don't lose focus.. just like before.. ahh.. uh.. ok, i am gonna, ah!" said Mijo as he tries to move his body accidentally touching his other parts, stopping him from continuing to move.

"I.. don't think this is normal.. While it.. has some similarities from what I've read.. this is way too.. extreme. What was.. in those two potions? I guess... this is... somewhat brand new.. at least, inferring from Jomi's vague wording..." said Mijo as he stayed still, attempting to wait out the sensation. He waits for a while, but the feeling never goes away, although it is less intense than before.

"Hah.. I can't keep this up, while.. it's so.. intoxicating.. I can't keep this for long.. Wait.. I have to write it down.. My phone..!" said Mijo, as he attempts to go out of bed and get to his phone, as he unlocks the door.

"Just... have to.. get this.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he grabbed his phone and walked quickly as fast as he could, with being dizzy and not having clothes on, and locked his door again, then he stumbles back to his bed, beginning to close his eyes. "No.. I.. have to, go to my notes app, and.. ugh.. No.. video?" said Mijo, as he looked at his phone and focused on the notes then the camera app.

"Ok, record.. Listen, Mijo.. Don't save this video nor should you let anyone but yourself see this, you've made this phone for yourself so.. anything that you see, write it down please.. Now.. no.. uh.. my.. storage.." said Mijo as he closed his eyes and fell unconscious, as the camera continued recording. Then after 2 hours, he finally wakes up in a daze.

"Huh.. Hah? Hah! What? I am still in this form.. and my phone? Oh no, my storage.. It's been recording for two hours, let's see what it recorded." said Mijo, as he stopped the recording and looked at the video, it replayed the first part, the whole message then after losing consciousness, after two minutes, he suddenly sees himself move his hands to the crotch and chest area and moan a bit before he paused and turned the screen off. "N—no... We are not watching me.. doing that for 2 hours. But.. ugh.. is that even me? Is.. Is that me? Is that what I did.. But.. why don't I remember this..? Like.. it's all hazy and dizzy, vaguely pleasurable but.. *sigh* I don't know.. and.. it's 23:30 too.. It's almost time to sleep so I can be early tomorrow..", as he lays down on the bed.

"I.. should check my.. huh?" said Mijo, as he looks into his notifications and sees messages from Urda 1 hour ago. 

Urda: Hey bro wanna play some Shingen Inpakuto? 
Let's do that new character's story quest like that girl with a gun that is a guard?
Oh you might be busy that's fine! I'll save it for saturday then, I'm just going to play in our Digmake Server! You'll have a surprise ;)

"Digmake? Like... the server we paid for 500 pesos? Huh.. It's a sandbox survival game, I wonder what she's trying to do.. blow up my house with TNT? Or replace it with a dirt house? Oh well. It was an hour ago, she must be still there.. But, I still have to continue my Shingen dailies!" said Mijo, as he went out of his bed and dressed up as he got his glasses and he transformed back. "Then let's get my phone and play some Shingen, then hop on the server!" muttered Mijo, as he grabbed his phone then went out of the room as he closed the door.

He went to his computer and started playing videogames, enjoying his time in Shingen and Digmake as he kept his phone charged and off. After a while, he eventually stopped playing and said goodbye to Urda as they logged off the night. He checked the time, and it was 0:30, an hour after the second experiment. He decides it was probably time to sleep and does the routine of cleaning and closing the room for the night before he heads off to his bed. As he does some chores before he heads off to bed, he listens to some videos as he tries to put the events before in the back of his mind, as it brings up memories that he prefers not to think of for now. 

Then he heads off to bed and sleeps, trying to move on and hopefully have a normal day tomorrow, although he sleeps without his glasses and he also grabs a long blanket to hopefully conceal any noticeable changes from his mother since she sleeps near him on another bed in the same room. As he sleeps, he begins to dream about the special events vaguely happening as it distorts to Jomi noticing and watching. In his dream, it is distorted to have more sensual and pleasure than what actually happened as he begins to imagine Jomi observing then ignoring him. Then after 6 hours, he wakes up with a phone alarm playing, as he turns it off with a morning look.

"Agh.. Welp, I guess it's time. I better get my glasses and—" said Mijo, as someone is heard closing on him. "Not this time!" muttered Mijo to himself as he wears his glasses and transforms back. His father arrives and leaves due to seeing him clearly awake so he got out of bed, grabbed his phone and headed off to eat. He eats and then he goes off to shower, not forgetting to transform once inside the shower since it is hidden from anyone else, he notices the changes to how he showers due to the transformation, but he keeps focused at his routine. After showering, he grabs his towel and wears his glasses as he heads off to another room and dresses up as he watches his surroundings making sure no one sees him until he's done. Then he went to the living room to grab his shoes and school I.D.

"I'm just going to clean this.." said June, as he takes the glasses of Mijo to properly clean it with anti-fogging liquid with a large microfiber cloth. He noticed this immediately but he didn't want to draw attention as his chest was getting heavier on his clothes. He continued putting on his shoes as his father finished cleaning and put it down on the table as Mijo grabbed it before June looked at him again, as he transformed back. He then left to go and prepare their vehicle as Mijo put his phone in his sling bag, grabbed his things, looked himself in the mirror then promptly grabbed his face mask then left as May went out of the room to grab something as she noticed Mijo leave. "Bye anak!" said May, as they both wave goodbye to each other.

Then he went to his dad, so they drove to school. As this happens, Mijo is checking on his phone for messages in the classroom GC about the party, then he looks at the rice container that his classmates asked him to bring. Then he checks the other GC to see Urda telling him that she barely managed to get the time to open the dark world before being dragged into her classroom for the class by class party. Then he was dropped off at school as they waved goodbye to each other and he went into school. He brought his rice container on the way, walking up stairs, into their classroom before sneakily going out and jumping in the dark world nearby. He lands to find no one nearby.

"W—wait.. Where is everybody..? Jomi usually meets me here.. Hmm, though she could be just in her castle but.. then where's the bustling atmosphere..?" remarked Mijo, as he walked to Jomi's castle. He then noticed some guards at the entrance as he was stopped by them. "Her Majesty Jomi isn't allowing any lightners nor any of us to enter the castle!" said one of the guards.

"Then where's the others? Where's Jomi?" questioned Mijo, as the guards looked at each other and gave Mijo a piece of paper with Jomi's handwriting.

Hey, If you see this, this means that I have left the castle with some guards to deal with some abyss threats. I am currently writing this in the downtime, but as for now, there was a sudden surge of abyss attacks that just happened, and so I've been focusing my efforts there, sorry if I couldn't be there and I promise I'll be there next time, until then.. follow my orders and leave for now. The other people have either joined me or have joined the other guards in protecting and making shelter. The timeframe is this day, that includes your students night, so good luck there and have fun! 

— signed by Jomi (The Princess~)

"O—oh.. I see.. I'll have to inform the others, have you seen any other lightner?" asked Mijo, as the other guard answered, "We saw Miss Urda enter first and then Sir JR entered before they went to us, we explained the situation then they left."

"I see. I'll go now. Good luck soldiers." said Mijo, as the other guards saluted as he left and returned to the light world. He went out and closed the dark world as JR was waiting for him outside their classroom.

"Hey, you closed the dark world, right?" asked JR, as Mijo nodded and leaned into the wall nearby him. "Well, Jomi said something about the abyss threats, and you said you've been researching about the abyss and the abyss doctor. Soo, any information you can.. share?" asked JR, as Mijo thought about it and answered, "Uh.. Well, I've also been reading about him and have been talking with Jomi a lot, however this one was unexpected, not even we expected it, so I am just waiting until next week or later to see what happens."

"I see, I was also wondering but couldn't ask anyone knowledgeable enough, such as you, or Jomi. Hmm.. Wouldn't this dark world crisis affect the party today?" asked JR, as Mijo answered, "I think so, but I don't know when it will erupt so I guess we have to stay vigilant."

"Welp, I guess we just enjoy until battle is necessary then, are you.. coming in the classroom?" questioned JR, as Mijo smiles and responds, "Just tell them that I am sick or something, I.. got a disguise..!" as he reveals his transformation by taking off his glasses.

"Oh! oh? Magic works in the light world?" questioned JR, as Mijo showed off and answered, "Think so, you'll have to ask Jomi—" as they both say, "But she is busy!"

"Yeah! She is. Anyways, what do you think?" asked Mijo as JR inspects Mijo, "You look like Jomi in a suit honestly." remarks JR, as Mijo nodded and said, "That's true. Anyways are you going in? It looks like it's starting."

"Yeah, uh good luck I guess." said JR, as he went inside and a couple of others started to call on the class. He transformed back to his other form, and chilled outside of the classroom, as he scrolled on his phone. He messages the GC saying that the dark world was closed due to abyss threats and that they should stay vigilant but be informed. He goes back to scrolling his phone.

After a lot of doing nothing, he decides to transform and check out the school, making sure to watch out for other people. There were surveillance cameras, but to the cameras it looked like there was just a student that was walking around, and there could be many reasons why so he also thought of reasons if he ever gets questioned. He is particularly going to a demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it.

"Hey, uhh where _is_ Mijo? Doesn't the message in the GC say that the dark world was closed? Then where is he?!" questioned Ikari, as she sits in a chair in the classroom, as she's talking to Lauvielle. "I don't know.. I was going to ask JR, but he seems busy.." responded Lauvielle, as JR is talking to someone else about something. "And you two have.." said Ikari, before Lauvielle said, "Yeah.. we uh.. have somewhat of a falling out due to our research project having some issues, you get it, Mijo talked about it in our 3-person GC."

"Oh look, he seems to be finished. I'll go ask, he sees me less.. negatively. Than you at least." said Ikari, ss Lauvielle nodded and watched Ikari go towards JR. "Yeah, the zoo party game was a total mess. I don't wanna know what they thought would happen when a bunch of highschoolers scream at each other to find their 'group'." said JR, as Ikari overhears this and says to JR, "Hey JR, I have a question."

"Oh? Yeah, what is it?" asked JR before Ikari answers, "Where is.. Mijo? He uh.. told us about.." she looks around and continues, "the dark, yeah. And I was wondering if.. no, where he is?"

"Oh. Hm." responds JR as he also looked around, before answering, "He's.. hmm, check the GC. I'll post there."

"Oh, ok. I'll await it then." said Ikari, as she goes back near Lauvielle. "Oh? My phone? Ah ok.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari nudges her to check her phone. They go to the gc to see JR typing until a message appeared:

JR: As for @Mijo's whereabouts, he told me to tell you guys he's sick but we know that's codeword for he's not going to attend class for a reason, likely the reason why the dark world was closed, staytuned he might need us

"Oh, so he's like on a quest again, like what Urda told us Jomi is on... They really are.." said Lauvielle, before Ikari interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I get it. Hmm, I'm kinda bored.. Why don't we help Mijo? Let's say we want to go the CR, I am sure they won't care."

"Uh... ok. Tara." said Lauvielle as the two excused themselves from the classroom party and headed outside. "Easy. Let's.. huh, who is that?" questioned Ikari, as she looks over to a girl who is headed to the ruins of a demolished building. 

Meanwhile, Mijo has entered the ruins of the demolished area, as he uses his transformation to avoid anyone recognizing him. He was particularly interested how spacious it was and how it was ignored and there has been no effort to close it off. "Huh, this is interesting.. You know, if there was a boss fight here, it would have the space! But.. I am sure nothing bad will happen.. please?" said Mijo to himself, as he heard a loud thud behind his back. "Aw man.." said Mijo, as he turned around to see a dark abyss figure materialize in front of him. "And.. Where's my weapons? Uh, oh no." said Mijo, as he tried to summon his weapons with no response. "You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "Oh no, uh.. stick? That will do." said Mijo, as he grabbed a long wooden stick to protect himself. The dark figure immediately sprung to slash him, easily breaking his stick and forcing him back. "I am soo fucked." said Mijo as he looked at the dark figure walking at him intimidatingly. "Welp, I guess it was good while it lasted.." said Mijo, as the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground, as the other two watched at the sidelines.

"T—that abyss monster just killed her! W—we have to get everyone here!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari got her phone to quickly call the others. "Wait.. where's Mijo then? He's supposed to handle stuff like this.." asked Ikari, as they both frantically call their GC. "If he was here, he wouldn't be able to do anything?! We don't have our own magic, so he doesn't but.. how did they appear?!" responded Lauvielle, as the dark figure looked at them menacingly. 

"Ah! Let's run!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari already started running as soon as the dark figure looked. "H—hey! Wait up!" shouted Lauvielle as she ran to Ikari's position.

Meanwhile, Mijo wakes up at an unknown dark space with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center. "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and to the ground, then he falls to the ground. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword and summoned the hilt as through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up..." said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two help Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "Y—yeah! Uh, JR told us you used transformation magic so we know that form, a—and.. we called as much backup as possible. I know you probably went here with the intention of not getting us involved, but.." explained Lauvielle before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others try to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summons a sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and kills the dark figure, making it dissapear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others look at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?" said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they waved goodbye to Mijo. As he rested and reflected, Urda, Rhida and Ikari were coincidentally right next to each other as the others left.

"Hey, you two.. You uh.. worried about Mijo? He seems to be.. well, going through a lot. I am not sure what he went through as he was.. in my arms but.. seeing his.. transformation and the fact that he hasn't even tried to get his stuff yet, I am.. concerned." said Rhida to the other two as they look at Mijo still staring off into the distance. "Yeah.. But, if you're thinking that we can help him, you should probably exclude me. I am the worst at.. comforting people, and he even comforts me a lot of the time... anyways, my dad's calling. See you two later!" responded Ikari as she left waving goodbye at the other two. "Is.. she saying the truth?" asked Rhida to Urda, as Urda shrugs and answers, "I don't know honestly.. I don't know much about her besides being her research partner, after she switched with her old one.. Mijo told me it was for complicated reasons but.. Lauvielle left early so I can't ask anyone else besides him."

"Uhuh.. Well, someone has to give him his stuff, and the rice container he brought.. Apparently his contribution to the party of his section..?" said Rhida, finding a way to smile amidst her troubled emotions. "Haha, well. I could do it, I guess.. But.. considering previous events.. You should do it." responded Urda, as Rhida blushed and says, "Huh? What? No no way..! Haha, even considering that.. You should do it, you were friends with him longer!"

"Hah? Really, are you missing this opportunity? Come on, sis its like a chance to dance with somebody, like the song they played at the mass demo for some reason.. I got this, you know.. like, I won't be jealous, ok?" retorts Urda, trying to hide her feelings. "I—is that— No way, I am.. not that confident, well no I am confident, just.. that we have a lot of baggage ok? You get it, and his parents might be calling him!" responds Rhida, as she looks over to Mijo then back to Urda. "Right, and that's why you should get this stuff and give it to him, and as he checks his belongings, you can ask him about—" said Urda, before being interrupted by Rhida, "W—what? You have experience? Like you've been trying to see if he likes you back by doing only subtle things to not ruin your relationship?"

"N—no... You're projecting your own actions, I.. uhh don't have any feelings, ok? Just, platonic pure gamer buddies.. always have.. been... Yep..." responds Urda, as she sits down on a nearby chair, now more troubled. "Um.. I.. think we have our own unresolved issues.. I.. didn't know you.. I'll go now." said Rhida, as she gives more space to her and Urda. Then as soon as Rhida was far enough, Mijo finally stood up and saw the two far away from each other, and his things at a table near the two girl's things.

"You two, are you still waiting for your parents?" asked Mijo, as he grabbed his things and checked his phone. The two girls tried to say something, but they fell short on what to say. "I see. Well, here's my glasses.. and oh look, perfect timing, my parents are on the way, judging by the time, they should be near.." continued Mijo, as he wore the glasses, transformed to his old form and was still looking at his phone. "I.. guess I'll be the first one. My parents are here, so.. Um.. hey, uh Mijo. Once the party happens, come meet me at the spot near the CR's, you'll know when.. I.. think. I gotta go now, see you two later!" proposed Rhida as she left, and waved goodbye as Mijo turned his attention to Urda.

"Oh, my turn.. again. Well, I am.. embarassed to say it, but to just confirm, you heard the entire convo earlier, right?" questioned Urda, as Mijo chuckles and answers, "Yeah, unwittingly.. I was going to grab my stuff but, I noticed you three talking so I stayed until done.."

"Oh. Oh. I am.. uh.. it took this long to reveal it huh.. Even after I thought you moved on.. Well, thanks for staying true to me all those times.. I—it's my fault, i guess.. I had.. romantic feelings for you, I should've just told you directly. But, you got her, Rhida.. And, we're just bestfriends." continued Urda, as she teared up a little. "I.. should go.. My parents are calling me and.." said Urda, before Mijo hugged her for a while before she broke away and says, "Thanks. Even though I know what your feelings are, you're still willing to give this.. girl something to hold onto. Goodbye, see ya." said Urda as she waved goodbye before Mijo also went home making sure to not bother her after she turned around and he started walking because his parents were there way earlier than  he expected.

He went home and rested on his bed as he stared at the ceiling, processing the events. He checked the GC to see the messages, there's only from Urda;

Urda: @everyone the current crisis has been temporarily fixed by the Mijo and the gang so enjoy your students night until another one appears lol

"Huh, ok.. Guess I don't need to message then." said Mijo, as he closed his phone and drifted to sleep, as he was still exhausted from the battle. He entered a dream where he was transported to school as he was about to enter it.

"Welp, just another day. Let's go." said Mijo, as he walked until he saw a certain girl that was facing the flag pole, that was directly ahead of him, so she was turned away from him. So he walked to the girl and questioned, "Uh.. who are you?"

"Oh, You don't know? I am you." said the girl, as Mijo responded, "Well, what's your name then?" as she chuckled and said, "It doesn't matter, Jomi.. Mijo.. I am still you..!"

"So, Jomi? What are you doing here? Is this the dark world from my first time, or the light school, the one that's.. real y'know?" questioned Mijo, as the girl responded, "Hmm, it's a bit different, how about you see for yourself..?" said the girl as she disappeared and Mijo quickly turned to see Urda at the open gymnasium. "Uh.. hey?" asked Mijo as he walked up to Urda, she was silent. "Hey..? You ok? You can tell me everything.." continued Mijo, as Urda started crying. "H—hey.. It's fine, just tell me. Please." asked Mijo as he became more distressed and worried. She continued crying for a while as Mijo tried to comfort her but to no avail. She stopped crying suddenly, and as she looked around and saw him, with a sad expression. "Oh, you're here.. I thought you'd already left.. Haha.. Everyone always.. drifts, and.. I am always alone. You get it, right?  Feeling alone while there's so many people around, and being able to make bonds that break every year.. And, the worst part is.. rejection. Haha, I feel like I am hopelessly drifting in life, and when you get that one connection and it just dies..?"

"I.. I.. I know, but.. is this about earlier? I am sorry, ok..? I just.. don't feel the same, even before I transformed. That's why I did actually, but.. I did suspect you for a while, then I thought you moved on.. Should I have—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupted, "No, actually It's all my fault. I don't think I'll ever get it right, and we're separated now right? It doesn't matter. Your words.. mean nothing to me now. I should've stayed by myself, relying on no one. For that, this.. dark power, is mine. I'll create something better.", as she held an unknown source of abyss power.

'H—huh? That doesn't make sense..? Stop blaming yourself! And what are you doing with that power?!" shoutrd Mijo, before Urda disappeared. "Oh, is that a reflection? or nonsensical amalgamation of your worse anxieties about her?" said the certain girl as she appeared behind him. "H—huh? I don't think of her like that! I don't think she hates herself, she probably just misspoke, it will never escalate!" responded Mijo, as the certain raised her eyebrows. "Oh, then you don't get it.. Let me show you the worst of the worst.." said the girl as she made Urda, Rhida and Jomi appear. "W—wait?! Then who are you?" questioned Mijo, as he looked at the three with different looks.

First, from the right to the left, Urda had both of her guns out with a dark blue aura, as well as floating double sword, with a neutral and numb face. Jomi had her long hair on her shoulders with a dark purple aura and a neutral face as she held a hilt at one hand and a blue fireball in the other hand. Rhida had her eyes whitened out as she floats with ice all around her as she wieled an ice sword. "What is this? Why are they just standing around?" questioned Mijo, as the certain girl's voice spoke to him, "These are your worst nightmares!" as the three suddenly teleport near him and start attacking. "My sword!" said Mijo, as he wielded a sword and deflected and parried their attacks as their relentless attacks wear down Mijo, before Jomi stabbed him at his heart. 

"Ah! Ugh.. I.. why.. what.. is this.. a dream?" said Mijo, as he was forced to stand up with immense pain as he looked at the three. "A dream, you needed to know. Now, let us set a scene.." said Jomi, as she set a chair she manifested as the others hold Mijo down. "I.. What is this supposed to be?! Jomi? You should understand, let me out!" shouted Mijo, as Jomi imprisoned her with dark magic. "This, is.. what you deserve." said Jomi, as the three of them tortured Mijo intensely with immense pain as it stayed like this for a while, as he woke up in a cold sweat, tears in his eyes and heavily breathing.

"What was that?! I.. what.. Who.. was that..? And.. I.. can't.. it's just a dream.. right? Haha, yeah.. It's nothing, it.. doesn't represent anything, haha..? I.. uh.. don't.. have anything to talk about, I don't think that dream's real, its just weird hehe.. I.. yeah sure.. Huh? My phone.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he checked his phone to see a message from Urda and Rhida. "Oh, it's them. I better go check their messages." said Mijo as he checks Urda's first. 

Urda: Bro I just got a dream where you like guide me to the school and you got Rhida to freeze my legs then you got Jomi and Rhida to beat me up as you looked at me having a smug face, then you decided to tie me to chair to have me be beat up by you idk if its like special but it wasn't like my other dreams so it could be dark world magic or something

"Oh. Lemme look at Rhida's then." said Mijo as he checks Rhida's message.

Rhida: Idk who to share this to but it includes you so i just had a dream where Jomi guided me to the school then she disappeared as then you appear me completely ignoring me as Urda and Jomi appear behind me to pull me away as you moved closer to me still ignoring me as Urda and Jomi try to beat me up and when I try to stop them you appeared stopping me and making me lose my footing as i fall to the ground and get dragged and tied up as the others bear me up its weird and so extreme but i think you might know what it entails

"Huh. Really? Interesting. They had the same dream but.. Jomi's there and that girl wasn't.. that's weird. I better check with Jomi later." said Mijo, as May calls him to prepare for students night.

After dressing up for students night, wearing a dark blue polo, dark blue pants and a black coat he decided to keep in his sling bag as it was still a bit hot outside. 

"Alright, you look good. Enjoy your night, 'nak!" said May, as he checked his belongings one more time, a ticket that he found while he was going through his stuff, it was the ticket to the students night area. Then his phone, handkerchief, water bottle, and coat. He then went to school as he was brought there by his dad.

"Goodbye anak enjoy your night!" said June, as Mijo entered the school grounds, waving goodbye back as his father left. Then he went inside as a teacher checked his bag for illegal stuff before letting him in, then he went to a student goverment panel where he saw a line for his grade.

"Huh, I guess that's what this is for.. I wonder who put it in here.." said Mijo, as he pulled out his ticket from his wallet and headed to a line, after waiting and being allowed in after signing in into a document, he sat where his fellow classmates are in the left side of the gymnasium as there were thousands of chairs organized. He picked a seat near some people he was acquaintances with and sat down then he saw JR returning from the CR. He sat down soon after.

"Hey, uh who put the ticket to students night on my bag? I wasn't there the entire party, so I couldn't have received it myself.." asked Mijo, as JR smirked and answered, "It was me.. I knew you wouldn't come back anyway, so I grabbed yours and put it in your bag."

"I see.. Thanks dude. Anyways, what do you think about the 'crisis'?" asked Mijo, still using codewords about the dark world related event they experienced earlier. "Hmm, well I think that the main problem likely isn't solved yet, and that's why I am staying here. I was going to leave and not even come here, but due to the issue, as well as the student government oath, I am here." responded JR, as he thought about being elected as a workshop manager in their local school robotics club.

"Cool, cool.. Is _she_ here? asked Mijo, as JR smiled and answered, "Duh. I waw actually talking to her earlier, she's right there." as he pointed to a somewhat far away seat where Rhida was talking with some of her friends. "Oh then.. Ok, I'm just going to sit here.." said Mijo, as JR nodded and spoke to other people as he looked at his phone. He saw Ikari and Lauvielle separately panicking to him about being almost late since the time is getting closer to the start of the party. He looked back to his surroundings and saw Urda come in, speaking to her friends. He quickly looked away and took a picture of the general area as he saved it. 

He decided to observe the people coming in while keeping himself busy by looking at the messages of his friends. He saw Leviente come in then Fexili, as the afternoon darkens. After a while, it was pretty much late now but a few people were still coming in. Ikari came in as she walked nearby him and sat behind a couple of chairs that were free.

"Hi! I didn't notice you enter actually, I was looking at Lauvielle's messages, It's a good thing that you arrived, before the gates closed haha." remarked Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and responded, "Yeah, I arrived before I saw your last message, anyway.., Hold on, I'm going to talk to someone else, see you later..!" as Ikari talked to someone nearby.

 He then looked at his phone then back to the people, as he was observing and waiting for the event to start. He eventually saw Lauvielle come in, but he didn't talk to her, he just saw her go and seat at a nearby free chair. He got bored and started to play videogames in his phone before the event started and he put his phone in his bag.

"Hello, hello welcome to the night of your lives! As we celebrate another end of the school year, I would like to inaugurate our new school government, and associated clubs!" said the announcer on the stage. "Oh, it looks like the student government is on their way.." said Mijo to himself, as a bunch of random people, likely officers started to stand and walk near the stage.

"Ugh.. This is boring. I might as well go to the CR now.." said Mijo to himself, as he got out of his seat and went to the CR. Then as he went to the CR he bumped into Urda before going inside. "Oh, hi." said Urda, as Mijo waved and said, "Hi.. I'm going to the CR, so.. we'll talk later!" as he excused himself to continue inside the CR as he doesn't notice Urda's saddened expression.

After finishing, he went out of the CR and decided to head back, going through the same place he bumped into Urda before sitting down and seeing the inauguration happen. " *sigh* You know what, Imma start drinking, this sucks." said Mijo, as he drank the rest of his water bottle. "Oh that's it.." said Mijo, as the inauguration finishes and the other students head back to their seat. Then their school principal starts a speech that Mijo quickly tunes out, "Man, can we just start the party, or will I have to play Plants versus Robots, on my phone.. " said Mijo to himself, as he stared at the stage.

"Or—or.. Maybe some abyss monsters appear and.. wait, no... we're not even sure if we get our powers anymore. And with so many people outside.. Haha, I am kinda wondering.. when's.. the.. dance. Huh, I.. uh.. should.. where is she..?" said Mijo to himself, as he looks around and doesn't see Rhida. "Oh, no. Well, I better get going." said Mijo, as he stood up and rushed to the spot near the CR's Rhida was talking about.

"Uh.. is she here? Oh, that's definitely her." muttered Mijo to himself as he approached Rhida standing at the spot, waiting for him. "H—hey! So, what did you want to talk about..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was silent for a while before answering, "H—honestly.. I don't know.. And, I feel like I should say this now rather than any other time. Mijo, I've always considered my feelings, but.. throughout all of this, you've been.. silent.. You're not the type to not say anything about you, and who _you_ are. So, as.. much as I don't want to hear it... Mijo.. do you _still_ love me?"

Mijo was silent, he was taken aback, but he knew this was coming. But he understood what she was meaning by this, and answered, "I.. I.. guess I should've known you would say this, haha.. I always wondered.. why.. why can't I love you, or why can't I just turn on the switch and I'll be all lovey-dovey and we'll already be dancing on the dance floor... I thought this transformation would change something, if I experience something different I would feel it, but.. nothing. But it's not like I don't care about it, no.. even worse.. I obsess over it, without the love part. I've always been thinking, am I attached to you, because you said so, and so I shall.. or did I decide to 'try' because I got my opportunity..? I don't know, I don't know.. These complicated emotions, especially with the accidental transformation.. I just feel that if I say yes, would I be staying true to myself? You would want me to be me, right? But I don't know who is me, anyway. I've been struggling to think about it over school and dark world matters.. So, do I love you? I... I.. guess not, then.." answered Mijo, before looking at a wall, trying to avoid Rhida's gaze, as he is filled with dread, sadness and confusion.

"I—is that so..? You didn't... But.. why.. and.. *sigh* I.. have to.. excuse myself. Sorry, Mijo." said Rhida, as she rushed away to another private spot in the school. "I knew it.. This day would come. Just.. I wish.. ugh.. It's all gone now, I.. should've just said it to her straight, I.. *sigh* it's all gone. Haha.. I guess, even when your dreams come true, there's still conflict." muttered Mijo to himself, as he was seen by Urda, looking for him. 

"Oh? You're here? Uh.. Guess here goes nothing." said Urda to herself as she went over to Mijo. "Oh, w—what.. Are you here to bring me the second breakup..? Just.. speak." said Mijo, as he also avoids Urda's gaze. "H—huh? What happened..? I.. uh.. guess this is a bad time.." responded Urda, as Mijo continued, "Yes, it's always a bad time.. Now, if you don't have anything to say.. leave me alone."

"Hey? What's with the.. attitude..? Oh no, I see. I'll.. uh.. l—leave.. then." said Urda, realizing the implication, seeing Rhida leave earlier, with tears in her eyes. "Stay. You look like you have some important things to say, so say it now. Don't delay it." said Mijo, now gaining some semblance of toughness to Urda. "Oh, y—you know what, bro.. I think my statement is—" responded Urda, before Mijo, now turning to face Urda, trying to hold his emotions together, and interrupts "Do it. Any semblance of my emotional stability is gone, so carry on."

"Uh.. ok.. Whew... Now.. I completely forgot what I was going to say.. Shit.. Uh.. Hmm... I am sorry that whatever my mess is, you're dealing with it now.. But, uh.. Honestly dude.. I don't know what you two have been through but.. me? I have only realized one thing, I am just.. afraid of losing you. N—not in a romantic way! I think.. But, even with new people in new sections.. I've always gravitated to you, no matter how different we are. Is that why we're best friends? I don't know.. But, I've only realized this after two instances of us almost being separated forever, at least at the time.. Is that, I just don't wanna lose everyone again, not like my life before.. You, my bro.. Symbolize how I liked having true bonds with my friends, and no care for that lovey-dovey stuff, to others.. Especially when we first met, we may seem like a couple but.. we're just best friends, united in.. gaming.. haha.. Um, I get ya.. Having alone time is precious, so.. I'm going to leave. Oh and the speeches are about to end.. I think. Goodbye!" said Urda, as she left with a more happy expression than when she first saw Mijo.

"Haha.. Ok.. ok.. Just.. a lot... Ok, so.. Urda.. Urda.. Ok, I see.. My thoughts have been swirling around her but I realize.. yes.. Ok, we are good friends. That's good. She.. understands I guess. And for Rhida.. I don't know.. It's not done yet. If it was, she would've said so. She needs her private space, and so do I. I.. ok.. So, ok.. I can return to my seat." said Mijo as he starts walking back, hiding his emotions as he looks around the school.

He finally makes it to his seat, as the rest of his classmates clap at the end of the speech. He looks around to see Urda half-asleep, Rhida still gone, Ikari using her phone and Lauvielle talking to someone else. He feels a sense of relief but stays vigilant, wary of the situation unfolding.

Meanwhile at Rhida's spot at some benches that were near a school store. Rhida is seen crying to herself as she tries to keep herself composed to not draw attention to her. "Why.. why.. is he..? ugh... I.. can't believe it.. Is.. everything a lie? Was he just manipulating me? But.. why? I've never actually seen him laugh, and barely a smile or two.. He was always so.. numb? Like, he was a mixture of seriousness, coldness, or always on the verge of bursting to tears or anger.. D—did I do anything wrong? I don't know.. We never properly solved our issues during the fallout between the months.. always getting excuses to Jomi.. I was.. so distraught of myself to lie to Jomi, just so I don't see him. That.. deal? A way of me maneuvering so that I don't have to face him, but no matter what.. Ugh.. But.. even then.. I.. just wish that I got over it, one slip up and now I am trying to pursue someone that.. *gasp* *sigh* I.. is that.. forceful? I don't think so.. But, even then.. He's likely back to his seat, drinking away his sorrows.. He always told me that if he ever had a student night he would spend the night eating and drinking.. But, would he want a dance? Does he like to? I don't get it. He says he doesn't love me, but.. why do I always feel like he's looking at me while I am not.. I've talked to my friends, it seems that he doesn't divulge much to them too.. So, does he think it's one-sided? Does he want to reciprocate it? I.. don't understand how.. someone that you love and that they apparently love you, just.. doesn't? He doesn't hate me.. But, rather.. he's scared of me, because he's compassionate, and a selfless guy but.. he can often devolve himself and put too much to his back. I.. didn't know that this is how you break something up. But.. then again.. I can't just cry here... I have to talk to him. It was a shock to him, so he quickly defended and rationalized his attitude but.. it'd be better if dialogue happened. After all, it's a night of fun.. *sigh* But.. clearly the two of us aren't having fun, so.. one more talk. Then.. I can finally stop this tension and distance between us." said Rhida to herself as a lot of students pass by her. Then she decides to go back to her seat. She intentionally didn't look at Mijo's direction as she sat down.

"Good job with the exams, may your test scores be high and honor before excellence! God is good, all the time!" said the principal before he exited the stage. "That was a great speech by our great and honorable principal! Anywho, let the night start! The dance floor is now, officially open!" announced the announcer on the stage as the rest of the students start going to the dance floor, while pop music plays in the background.

"Oh it's starting. Well, time to go to the foods and drinks section. Hopefully they have the.. IntelC++ drinks, the orange and lemon ones.. specifically." said Mijo, as he stood up, got his bag and went to the school cafeteria, where they were selling a bunch of hotdog sticks and juice drinks. "Thank you." said Mijo as he paid ₱75 for a big hotdog stick and a bottle of IntelC++ lemon version.

He sat down near a couple of chairs and tables, and coincidentally Ikari was there, checking her phone. "Oh hey, what you doing here? I thought you had like.. someone to.." said Mijo, as he looked at Ikari with a sad expression. "Oh, nothing.. Just.. some broken friendships.. That's all.." sarcastically said Ikari, as Mijo became concerned. "O—oh? Uh.. That's.. really unfortunate.." said Mijo, now reflecting on the previous events. "Yeah, you don't know her though. We were best friends before, but.. well, I wanted to dance with her.. But, she.. had a different.. plan of her own." explained Ikari with a stern tone. "I see.. What are you doing now?" said Mijo, as he stood up and finished his food.

"I don't know.. You said to be vigilant so, I am staying here for at least a while.. But, whenever that happens, I guess I'll be ready." responded Ikari, as Mijo began drinking, then saying "Well, this could just be a.. normal day. Aside from the monster earlier. I am sure that, nothing will—" said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida coming to his position. "Will what? Look dude, every time you say that something bad happens.." remarked Urda, as Mijo stayed silent looking at Rhida.

"Oh hey guys! Ikari, Mijo! How's it been?" asked Lauvielle, as Mijo continued to ignore the others. "Terrible, how about you? You seem to have succeeded in your dance with Leviente." responded Ikari, as she pointed to Leviente speaking to his friends. "It's going well.. Not sure, what he's up to. 'One final time' he says. I am always not sure what his riddles and cryptic jokes always mean." answered Lauvielle, as she noticed Mijo's silence. "Hey Mijo, how about you? You won our bet. I 'danced' with him. Your 5₱.. next week? Hopefully before the end of the year.." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as he snapped out of his trance and Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah.. Haha.. That's what I call, 'motivation'."

"Well, how about that dark world danger that is constantly looming over us..? Any updates? Sorry, my phone's at like 16% so I don't want to open it.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari quickly responded, "If the others aren't stupid, there shouldn't be anything happening yet." as she checked her phone.

"Good, cause.. I have to talk to someone." said Mijo, as he points to Rhida approaching the group as Ikari and Lauvielle notice. "Ohh ok. Yeah imma go to the others, see you!" said Lauvielle as she left and Ikari responds, "Oh ok. I'll be alone here then." said Ikari, as she put on her earbuds to avoid eavesdropping.

"Hi, there.. What do you want..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked at him with a neutral expression, trying to hide her crying from earlier. "I.. want to talk about the.. love thing. Do you feel a—anything when you talk to me? Just, I need to know.." asked Rhida, as Mijo is trying to form his words properly. "I know you don't want me to go, but please.. this is the only way we can reconcile.." explained Rhida again, as Mijo is still thinking about what to say.

"Oh no.. Ah! Sorry.. But, Urda just sent an urgent message, there's a dark world opening at *the* place. You know what it is, come on. She said that magic is mixing into our world so we can use our weapons!" said Ikari, as she ran quickly to the ruins of the demolished area. "Of course.. Well.. let's go." remarked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they ran to follow Ikari.

"Hey! What are these guys doing here?! Isn't Jomi supposed to be like.. attacking the abyss monsters?! What are they doing here?!" shouted Urda, as the three arrived around the same time seeing monsters with blades and saws slowly rising from the ground. "I don't know?! I was honestly surprised by earlier! But now.." responded Mijo, as they all summoned their weapons to fight the monsters. "We have a chance." said Mijo, as he charged straight at the enemy as the rest followed and supported him with ranged attacks.

He sliced through the monsters with ferocious intent and the outpour of his emotions in his battle form is clearly shown as he battles a big abyss monster with two big shields in its hands. "Ice Shock!" shouted Rhida, as ice flew from her hands protecting Mijo from the rest of the abyss monsters. "My power is absolute!" said Mijo, as he dashed through space and slowed down time, striking the enemy with carefully placed slashes as he sheathed his blade, causing glass to shatter around him. "Mijo! You know that our ultimates—" shouted Urda as she shot her two pistols as fast as possible, while dodging around with the wind. "Yeah— I know.. But we don't need to last a long time, just enough for others to get here." responded Mijo, as he tried to focus on his movement. "Have you guys ever fought someone outside of the dark worlds?! It's.. rough!" said Ikari, as she tries to not die, as she  shoots her rifle at the enemy while running away against the other enemies.

"Once or twice.." answered Mijo, as he parried an attack from the big shield guy then he counterattacked with a jump to a mid-air plunge attack, knocking the big guy. "I am surprised that my—" said Mijo, before he was cut by the right part of his abdomen, knocking him back and his glasses to the ground. "Winter.. Storm!" shouted Rhida, freezing all available enemies as the others cleaned up. "Don't worry.. I am still here.. Just, a bit different!" said Mijo, as he regained his footing and put his glasses in his pockets, transforming to his other form. "They might break, but.. I got no choice... My power.. shall be absolute!" said Mijo, as he does his ultimate again, taking out all abyss monsters in the area including the big guy as he fell on his knees almost falling down, but managing to barely hold on.

"Mijo are you fine?!" shouted Rhida, as she went closer to Mijo. "Where are the others?!" questioned Ikari, as she also went to Mijo. "Watch out! Second wave!" shouted Urda, as monsters spawn around them and the abyss monsters managed to stab the other two, Rhida and Ikari. "Agh! What?!" screamed Ikari, as she was dragged by the blades of an abyss monster. "Ah! I—is this what pain.. feels like..?" said Rhida, as she was also dragged away by an abyss monster. "Mijo! Rhida! Ikari! Shit, shit.. I am trying to help! Hold on!" shouted Urda as she maneuvered around trying to get to the other three. "I.. need to help.. Agh! But.. why.." said Mijo, as he was wrapped around by random tentacles.

"I got you! Shit— Agh! Oof..." said Urda, as she was knocked by an abyss monster to the ground as she was near Mijo. "To live.. Ugh.. I must.. agh!?! What is this? I.. remember this.. abyss power.." said Mijo, as his energy was being corrupted by abyss magic. "I can't think straight.. My vision.. It knows.. it can't kill me, but.. ugh.. Ah..!" said Mijo as he tried to break out with little change. "Euphoria..? What.. is it doing..?" muttered Mijo, as his mind is swirling around, barely holding on to keep his sanity alive. "Ugh.. Just.. I guess.. this is worse.. than death..." said Mijo, as a mix of pleasure and dizziness took over his mind fully and he was dropped down by the tentacle abyss monster.

"Mijo? Mijo?!" said Urda, as Mijo is holding a sword that is not his, and with ripped clothes, almost like he was forcefully dragged by the monster to inject its magic. "Mijo? For the love of god.. Rhida and Ikari are here.. Don't.. kill us.." bargained Urda, as she prepared her blade for a potential fight. "What?! He really gonna turn on us now?!" said Ikari, as she was healed by Rhida. "N—no.. That's not him. He's.. *sigh* " responded Rhida, as the other two stood off. "That.. tentacle monster.. It's worse than trying to kill us, it's trying to **_corrupt_** us.. But.. How.. with him.." muttered Urda to herself, as she prepared her wind blades.

"Damn.. where the _fuck_ are the others?! We've been fighting for the past hour..! And now, fuckin Mijo is about to kill us!!" shouted Ikari as she tried to get up and run away. "Fuck this, I better get help. As I have already seen, he's gonna fuckin' kill us if he tries." said Ikari, as she runs from the place but then she gets stopped by an unknown barrier as she is knocked to the ground. "What? Fuck, we're dead.." said Ikari, as Rhida also notices that she hit a barrier that traps them in the area.

"N—no.. Then, what's happening with the others? If we're trapped since earlier, then we would've not been able to notice anything else happening outside.." remarked Rhida, as Mijo jumps to pluge on the group. "Watch out!" shouted Urda as she teleported near the others to deflect his plunge as he is knocked back on his feet. "These monsters, and Mijo.. We might have to defeat them.." said Urda, as she stood guard to protect Rhida, as Ikari quickly moved behind Urda, panicking internally. "Imma be real, we are not winning.." said Ikari, as she pointed her guns to the other monsters surrounding them. "But.. I am not dying like a bitch." said Ikari, as the other two also attacked the monsters, with Urda focusing at Mijo.

Urda clashed with Mijo, mirroring their spars. Mijo is the first one to strike by using dark magic to blast her back as a large strike, as she deflected it however she was pushed back by a bit. Then Mijo followed up with multiple slashes as Urda dodges easily and manages to get close to Mijo to attack him, but he blasted her away with dark magic, this time knocking her back from him by a lot. She got up and realized that the blast had damaged her clothes and was noticeably hurting more than normal. But she had to quickly focus at Mijo walking at her menacingly, as she ran to face him again. 

As she was about to clash blades with him, he suddenly dodges away from her and to Rhida. "What?! Hey!" shouted Urda, as she looks at Mijo surprise Rhida with an attack shattering her ice wall and knocking her back as Urda managed to get a hit on Mijo on his arm. He was unfazed then he knocked her back. "Don't worry! I got this!! FUUCK YOU!!!" screamed Ikari, as her gun overloads to launch a large flame projectile towards Mijo. As the flame engulfs it's surroundings, Ikari is slowly walking back from the destruction before being surprised by a seemingly fire-immune Mijo striking her, blowing her back to a wall knocking her down.

"Ugh.. Fuck.. Damn.. why did he had to be turned to the dark side.. I swear.. if any one of us were turned, it would've been quite easy.." muttered Ikari, as the flame dissipates, revealing the damage to the others due to their location near the explosive range. "Oh.. great. They're also damaged.. Huh.. can never.. seem to get it right.." remarked Ikari, as she looks at the other two on the ground. Mijo approaches her with  determined look as she looks over to him. "Hey.. is this the part where you kill me?! Just.. get it over with.. I am tired." said Ikari, as she looks at him, completely determined but clearly not in control, as his eyes now glow with purple. As he was about to raise his blade, Rhida managed to blast ice to Mijo, getting his attention. "H—hey! You'll not _ruin_ a single life anymore!" shouted Rhida as she was floating with ice all around her. "I might have been holding back, but Mijo wouldn't want us to, so.. this is.. ___WINTER STORM!"___ shouted Rhida as a blizzard from out of nowhere is summoned as Mijo focused at Rhida launching multiple slashes all being blocked by a huge ice wall.

"Ugh.. well.. fuck me.." muttered Ikari, as she layed down on the ground, seeing the impending doom. "Oh no.. This.. is not good.. She'll.. agh..!" said Urda as she tries to stumble her way to Rhida, but falling to the ground head first. "Ugh.. This.. is suicide. Hah, guess that's why they're a couple haha.. ugh.. Goodbye world.." said Urda as she stared at Rhida preparing her ultimate. "___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouted Rhida as she launched the blizzard freezing all living beings, as she drops down to the floor. "I.. can't believe it.. he's still.. *there.*" said Rhida, as she sees a Mijo covered in ice but moving towards her, walking slowly. "My.. power.. I.. ugh.. there's nothing else we can do.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with his blade pointed at her. As Mijo walks up to her, his blade maintained pointed at her, as she closes her eyes for the inevitability of death. But as she waited, she could feel no blade touch her, so she opened her eyes a bit to see his blade shaking. "What.. Is he.. hesitating..? Is he.. breaking out..?" remarked Rhida as she looks at his blade then to his eyes, noticeably the left eye was being turned blue from purple, but it was being turned back to purple, like his body and power is being fought by two parties, the corruption and Mijo.

Mijo walks back, as the blade is being turned towards himself. He struggles as he turned his blade towards his heart before stabbing himself. He falls to the ground, as Rhida calls out, "Mijo! NO! Please, please.. live..", while struggling to get to him. He's clearly in pain as he looks at the ground, trying to fight for his body back. "My Mijo.. come back.. Please.. I.. love you.. Ugh.." said Rhida to Mijo, as she succumbed to her injuries and fainted. As he witnesses her close her eyes, he reaches out before being forced back, holding the sword in his heart. He finally broke out as he stood up, but was knocked to the right of his position. He looks and sees a figure that looks similar to him but with the sword that is not his. "Who are you?!" said Mijo, as he manifests his sword out of nowhere with its scabbard. The figure then attacks him, but he dodges and slices the right abdomen of the figure. The figure stumbles as he retaliates with summoning slashes, as the figure reflects it to him, forcing him to dodge. "Like I said, who the fudge are you?! " questioned Mijo, as he summons small blades to attack the figure as he focuses on the figure before the figure gets behind him and manages to get a small cut before Mijo deflects and manages to get a huge wound on the figure's chest. The figure retreats from him and tries to heal themselves. The blizzard stops as the area becomes clearer as the other three remain unconscious, now being obvious to Mijo.

"**Explain yourself.** Who are you, and.. why do you exist?" said Mijo with spite, as the figure finally looks at him, revealing his face. "Oho.. A *doppelganger* huh? A corrupted version, well.. of course.." remarked Mijo, as he stares down at his doppelganger. "Your presence is only restricting us from **full power.** Give up, in your friends, lovers, everyone. You have killed them anyway, so.. *submit.* While you can." said the doppelganger with clear anger and madness. "What should I call you.. Jomi? No.. you don't deserve a name." said Mijo, mocking the doppelganger, as the doppelganger smiles and says, "No need. I'll call myself, ***Cara.*** We share a name, I am Mijo Cara."

"It's insane how you think you are me. You are not. 'Cara'? Really? Couldn't come up with an original name? Ok then, Cara.. Let's dance." said Mijo, as the two faced off, waiting for the other to attack first. "You are inherently weaker.. Your body is your transformation, and with us separate. You can no longer rely on yourself." said Cara, as he mocked Mijo, noticing his magic less powerful than what he expected it would be. "I'll still beat you, by myself. I only need my perseverance and will. You are nothing but an abyss monster pretending to be me." responded Mijo, as the two glared at each other intently. "Weakling. Pathetic. Scum." said Cara, as he attacked first, crossing blades with Mijo.

Mijo retreats and keeps a defensive stance as Mijo says to himself, "Damn it.. he's right.. This split is affecting me a lot, I can't use my magic properly.. While he seems to be unaffected.." as Cara smiles menacingly and attacks him, making him deflect but forcing him to lose further ground to the wall. "Damn. My offense is limited, I wonder if.. **they** can still fight?" said Mijo, as he intentionally starts hurling a bunch of slashes as he moves to the left to get to Urda. "What? Trying to revive your friends? Haha.. Even if you got all three, you would still succumb to me." said Cara, as he kept parrying his slashes.

"It doesn't hurt to try!" said Mijo, as he got to Urda, covered in snow and unconscious. "Oh it will.. Such is the way of the light." said Cara, as he stops attacking to see Mijo attempt to wake Urda up. "Stardust Crusader.. May you stand again and fight for yourself.." said Mijo, as he heals Urda, noticeably hurting himself in the process. "What is this.." questioned Mijo, as he continued healing Urda, persevering through the pain. "You'll see very soon.. Haha.." responded Cara, as Mijo finished and he walked back a bit as Urda woke up. "What.. Mijo? and.. Mijo?! Shit.. which one of you is the real one?!" questioned Urda, as she sees Mijo from the right and Cara to the left.

"No need. You shall see!" said Cara, as he quickly attacks her, forcing Mijo to defend her position, pushing Cara back, but weakening Mijo a bit. "Mijo?! Who the heck is that clone of yours?!" questioned Urda, as she stood up and summoned her weapons. "No clue. Just.. ugh.." said Mijo, before he fell to his knees, succumbing to the pain a bit. "Mijo?! Damn you whoever you are, so.. you've been the one hurting my friends?!" questioned Urda to Cara, as he laughs maniacally and says sardonically, "Haha!! Here I am.. Got a problem?" said Cara, as Urda jumps to attack him but Cara manages to reflect her, forcing her back on her feet. 

She ran to Mijo and said, "Mijo?! Are you fine?! Hold on, I have some—". before Mijo quickly rejects her potions of healing and says, "No.. go to the others.. And revive them instead. I'll handle him." said Mijo, as he stood up and was still shaking as he ran to attack Cara. "Got it." said Urda, as she ran to a nearby Rhida. He attacks Cara, as Cara easily defends and manages to push him back using a dark blast. "I'll fight.. my own path! You.. whoever you are.. shall *die!*" shouted Mijo, as he relentlessly attacked Cara, while Cara smiled all the way, not even trying sometimes. Meanwhile Urda is healing Rhida, and Rhida wakes up and asks, "Huh..? What.. happened?"

"Mijo is fighting his clone while I am trying to heal us back, you got any consumables with you?" answered Urda, as Rhida smiles and responds, "I—I think so.. Is.. Mijo going to be fine?", as she gives Urda some health snacks and drinks. "I.. uh.. to be honest.. I don't know. He's uh.. doing fine, but.. it's clear he's.. in pain, a lot. Like way too much, something that an emo person would dream of haha.." responded Urda, as she heals Rhida enough so she could stand up. "Uh.. I.. understand. Let's heal Ikari, then we'll help him." said Rhida, as they ran to Ikari's position. 

"My my.. Getting restless, are we?" mocked Cara, as Mijo maintained his battle stance, and responds, "Yeah, what about it? I am not giving up, ever." "Sure, sure.. You might not be giving up, but your magic, your ___power___ is fading.. It's only a matter of time hehe.. That is why I don't need to fight you. Then, my ***power*** is also increasing with it, like.. transfering the true authority to me." said Cara, as Mijo tries to focus at fighting but he knows that what Cara is saying is true. "Even so. My friends are here, and they hold no mercy for you. Especially when I am here." responds Mijo, as Cara maniacally laughs and says, "We shall see.. But we know the end. Your friends dead, disintegrated and you having to submit to me, **fully.**"

Rhida and Urda come up to Ikari and they heal her, "Woah! Ugh.. This.. is.. my weapon, and you two are Urda and Rhida.. Is this the afterlife?" asked Ikari, as the other two helped her get up. "No. You might even say it's still hell.." answered Urda, as she points to the duel between Mijo and Cara. "Oh! I see Mijo has broken out, but who is he fighting?" asked Ikari, as Rhida responds, "You'll know him. Let's help Mijo." as they ran to Mijo's position.

"Agh... Fuck.. I am so.. **angry** at you, but ugh.. no matter what, I can't win.." said Mijo, after getting knocked back by Cara as he easily outpowered Mijo when they crossed blades. "Haha.. That's it.. Embrace the anger, embrace it!" responded Cara, as he continued attacking Mijo, forcing Mijo to defend until a surprise attack from Urda caused Cara to retreat back. "You will stop hurting Mijo ___now!___" said Urda, as she glared down Cara with wind around her getting stronger. "Oho? Your friends are back.. that's nice.. Then.. this will prove our strength, we don't need anyone, haha." responds Cara, as he transforms his sword into a massive broadblade that is now filled to the brim with Mijo's and abyss magic. "*Let's dance.*" said Cara, as he laughs maniacally.

"*Golden Wind!*" said Urda, as she unleashed her ultimate, moving at lightspeed making Cara parry all her slashes, but now being vulnerable to the shots by Urda and her burning rock projectiles and Rhida's ice making his movement worse forcing him back. "Combined Assault? You learn that after your defeat? How pathetic, you were only a given second chance." said Cara, as he jumped in the air and headed for Ikari, forcing Urda to stop him mid-air using her wind, so that Ikari can charge her gun to fire a large burning projectile to knock him back to the ground. Then Rhida used her ice gain to restrict his movement, this time with an intense blizzard being directed to Cara. "Haha.. Even so.. You shall die!" shouted Cara, as he unleased his sword at light speed, making the other three easily hit by Cara, damaging the three of them. "I can use speed too, Urda! The best part? I only need to use it **twice.**" said Cara, as he smirked and stopped to look at the three getting up. 

"Ugh.. I can't take it.. anymore.. My mind wants to continue but my body is.. fading.." said Urda, as she looks at Cara standing there, looking at her. "Ugh.. I.. if I use.. it again.. I''ll not survive another day. He's.. right, ugh." said Rhida, as she heard Urda's words. "Whew.. I guess.. uh.. I am gonna die again, soo fun." responded Ikari to the other two, as she struggles to handle her gun due to her injuries. 

"I.. can't stay.. like this. I can't give up yet, there is a light that must be buried." said Mijo, as he stood up again, with pain and suffering at every second he remains determined and motivated. "Through vacant halls, I won't surrender!" shouted Mijo, as he ran to face Cara. "Oho? Stop in your fantasies, my Mijo.. I am sure we both know what's the outcome." responded Cara, as Mijo stopped and glared at him. "Forsakened, I am awakened.. ***I AM HERE TO RECLAIM MY NAME!***" said Mijo before charging straight at Cara, attacking and defending as much as he can, testing Cara a bit. "If you want the power, then come try and take it!" said Cara, as he defended against Mijo's barrage of attacks. "I will." answered Mijo, as he dodged and parried all attacks of Cara, with neither of them getting hits in each other. 

"Look.. He's still fighting.. I.. can't give up yet.. I must stay determined." said Urda, as she observes the battle and uses her powers to maintain her footing and launches herself into the air to unleash a barrage of slashes at Cara. "This is fun. No distractions—" said Cara, before getting hit by Urda. Mijo instantly attacks and manages to get a lot of hits before Cara manages to stop Mijo, but the damage was already done. "Ugh.. Of course.. only when you get your so-called motivation, you get a few hits.." said Cara, before Mijo followed with a barrage of slashes forcing Cara to dodge.

"Ah? Is that.. Urda? and.. Mijo? I.. have to.. help them. No matter what happens, even if.. ugh.." said Rhida, as Ikari stood up and shouted, "Hah! You're getting beat by the power of friendship! It starts with this!" as she blasted Cara with a lot of burning projectiles like arrows, rocks and bullets, all headed to Cara. "I.. hmmm.. Let's do it." said Rhida, as she looks at Cara, struggling to maintain his health as he dodges the attacks from the other two while trying to parry and counter attack Mijo's attacks. "Here it goes.." she says, as she looks at Mijo another time. "I am sorry.. ___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouts Rhida, as she floats and her eyes turn white as a huge blizzard starts forming.

"Oh no.." said Urda as she witnessed Rhida charging her ultimate. "Huh? Wow.. ok..?" reacted Ikari, as she looked at Rhida floating with wind and snow swirling around them. Mijo looks at Rhida and realizes what he has to do. "A storm is approaching.. There's only one thing I should do. **_I shall be the storm that is approaching._**" declared Mijo, as he used the last of his lightning magic to influence the blizzard causing it to be even more extreme and chaotic than ever before.

"What a show.. Let's see if it pays off.. Hah?" said Cara, as he looks at the huge blizzard and thunderstorm mix slowly forming. "Huh?! Mijo?!  What are you—" said Rhida, as she noticed Mijo influencing the storm. "Do it, now!" shouted Mijo, as he's barely holding the storm and himself together. "Ah— Ok!" responded Rhida, as she unleashed the blizzard-storm mix, decimating everything in its path as everything is swallowed inside as everyone's vision fades to black.

Mijo wakes up in a familiar dark space, with a figure in front of him turned their back so familiar yet different. "What.. happened?" asked Jomi, as he recognizes her voice and is relieved as he stands up again. "I.. uh.. honestly.. I don't know.. I was.. too busy with my.. I mean— the party, to figure out anything happening.. I just followed my heart, and my mind.. So many things happened in the blink of an eye.. I am.. overwhelmed." answered Mijo, as he sat down on the floor, contemplating.

"You're lucky again, y'know? After hearing that, I.. am not surprised by what I saw. Did you know you were fighting in the dark world? That _abyss doctor_.. He found a way to.. disrupt our life **again**." explained Jomi as she turned to face Mijo, revealing her tattered and battered look, seeing as her clothes were cut and torn due to battle. "What.. happened..? to you, I mean." asked Mijo as she looked somewhere else, looking conflicted. "I.. think we should focus on you first. Let me set a scene, me and my guards saw three bodies and traces of abyss magic. Who were you fighting, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo tries to remember the  chaotic events earlier.

"Uhuh.. Well.. mm... They were definitely abyss monsters. They seem organized and controlled by someone, likely a subordinate of the _doctor_.." answered Mijo, as he remembers the previous events and is intentionally choosing his words. "I see.. It's as expected.. So, tell me.. Mijo, why do the most concentration of abyss magic trace back to **you?**" questioned Jomi, with her eyes narrowed to Mijo's trying to not look at her. "Uh haha... Uh.. it's a long story.. I'd prefer if we do not discuss it." responded Mijo, as Jomi unsheathed her sword to point it at Mijo, as Mijo walks back a bit and looks at a Jomi, who now has a more tense facial expression. "Explain yourself, or else." said Jomi, as Mijo held back his magic to not provoke Jomi and answered, "I.. ugh.. It.. starts with right after I went home." as Jomi sheathes her sword and says, "Go on."

"Well.. All I can say is, you know that.. potion you gave me? I decided to *sigh* experiment a bit.. after making I sure was alone, it was.. a strange feeling. It wasn't normal, I don't think any type of transformation can make you.. uh.." explained Mijo, before struggling to say the words that won't make him look worse. "What..? Say it. We're the only two here. Here's the thing, since you.. with your amazing magic used something, and now.. you're pretty much the only one like.. **'dead'** as in.. your friends are fine, however due to the insane use of magic during that battle they're knocked out, at least for now.. I can.. heal them, but.. I need to know the details first." interrupted Jomi, as Mijo was shocked at these words and remarked, "Huh..? I am dead? Like.. for real? Is this my dying consciousness or something?"

"No. *sigh* To be honest, you were about to die when I saw you three. Your body has been beaten so many times, more than the others actually. It doesn't help that your transformation glasses have been broken, likely in the battle. I am.. keeping you alive, as always. I knew that you were most likely the biggest catalyst of any potential surge of intense magic, at least.. not abyss ones." answered Jomi, as Mijo was relieved and responds, "Whew.. I.. survive another day. Uh.. want me to continue?" as Jomi nods and Mijo continues, "Well, the 'horny' effect." before Jomi snickered and commented, "Oho? Really..? The first thing you did was to.. touch yourself like a pervert? Y'know.. That indirectly says something about your attitude to transformation and me."

"Ugh.. I really didn't want to tell you now, but.. it's important, I swear!" explained Mijo, as Jomi keeps giggling a bit and remarks, "Is it..? Haha.. It's not like I don't know your preferences, but it's still funny to me whenever you admit it, like.. the so many times that you accidently say things about it.. Haha.." as Mijo blushes at the embarassment but continues, "A—anyways.. About the effect¸ it is the same thing when.. *sigh* we got beaten by the abyss monsters."

Jomi raised her eyebrows and asked, "Woah? You got defeated, big surprise.. But, whoever was your enemy.. They got defeated, right?" as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah.. I'm just going to say it, I was corrupted by the abyss." before Jomi raised one of her eyebrows, questioning what she had just heard. "Huh.. I am starting to get the picture.. Did you wield the abyss sword we found?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo expressed disappointment at himself.

"I.. Yes. I did. I.. basically got influenced by whatever they did to me that had the same effect, I also broke out of it and fought this manifestation of my corrupted form named.. Cara, you know something about it, Jomi? Considering our.. connection?" answered Mijo, as Jomi thought about it for a while, perusing her mind for an answer. "Hmm, I've always thought something about a third version of you appearing, but.. I've always thought it would be when the abyss doctor introduces them.. It's just a theory though, and.. this explains why I was also weakened a bit during my.. expedition. I have to confirm this, but my theory is that there's a light and dark version of each individual, it was simply a coincidence that we met first. But due to the nature of abyss magic, perhaps it can make more copies but is less sane and more unstable. It also probably takes any magic it can find, and I also happen to control some abyss magic for myself."

"Wow.. I agree. But only because I know as much in the dark world as I do in school, absolutely almost nothing. Even If I do, only a  grain of rice.." responded Mijo, as Jomi quickly comments, "Well, I don't know about that one.. You seem less confident than ever previously due to learning a lot of info about stuff in a week followed by weeks of normalcy. It's fiine. I am literally you, and you are me, it is that simple." 

"Yeah yeah. I know.. No need to remind me, actually.. I just.. have a lot to think about. L—lets continue." said Mijo, as he stops for a moment to recollect his thoughts before continuing, "So to fight this abyss monster, we had to launch a powerful blizzard—thunderstorm attack, and amplified by **my** use of my friend's magic, I didn't realize it but then I saw that I was also grabbing aero and fire magic to mix in, resulting in the most chaotic, destructive and powerful storm I've ever seen.." explained Mijo, as Jomi stayed silent for quite a while, before responding, "I see.. I think I get it now. Hmm, it seems that the **_abyss doctor_** was targeting you. To make sure he succeeded, he distracted me. Then he attacked your party, surprising you at your weakest, and by doing this he can gain control of a powerful enemy, as well as weaken a strong one. He's likely testing something, again. All we can do is to prepare for the worst."

"Uh.. when will he do something again?" asked Mijo as Jomi quickly responded, "I don't know. I saw signs of his presence but he wasn't present for the battles. Just.. enjoy the rest of your night." as Mijo stood up and questioned, "Cool, how do I revive again?" before Jomi answered, "Stay here. I'll leave and revive you fully, you're going to wake up in the dark world though, you need to close the fountain first."

"Oh yeah, well.. see you, Jomi." responds Mijo, as Jomi nodded and opened a portal as she looked at him one more time before heading out. Then as he looked around, suddenly he couldn't stop himself from dropping to the floor, as he woke up and saw the dark fountain. He looked around to see Jomi healing the other lightners, as he looked back at the dark fountain.

"I guess, I should close it then." muttered Mijo to himself as he went near the dark fountain and closed it as light took over his vision. He woke up at the light world laying down at the ruins of the building they went to. His transformation is still there, however due to the battle, his glasses are more scratched up and are more prone to breaking fully. He stands up, noticing that his body was more weak when he entered and he quickly wore his glasses, before looking at his friends, all slowly waking up. 

"Hey.. So.. the abyss threat has been neutralized for now, Jomi arrived to support us and we can finally rest for today." said Mijo, as the other three acknowledge Mijo's words in various nods and hums. "Oh, finally.. Damn that girl took a while, how about the others, Lauvielle.. JR?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle, Leviente, Jamise and JR arrived at their location. "We're here! Uh.. where's the enemy?" said Lauvielle, as Mijo, Rhida, Ikari and Urda look at her.

"You guys arrived late, we.. dealt with it." responded Urda, as the newly arrived lightners all express forms of disappointment. "Woah no way.. We fought through hundreds of monsters, and.. huh? Our weapons, they just disappeared?!" said Jamise, as she realizes her wooden staff is gone as all the others notice their weapons couldn't be summoned anymore.

"Oh, right. We were flashed by a huge light before getting our footing and going here. That's probably the closure of the dark world we fell on." explained JR. "Mhmm.. All we saw and heard was a huge explosion, we assumed that was the dark world and started heading but then we saw a bunch of abyss monsters appear around us, we couldn't leave the unconscious people be potentially threatened so we stayed to fight them." added Leviente, as the others processed the statement, "Although, they seem that they were targeting us.. It's weird, why didn't they get dark world magic?" commented Jamise, as she narrowed her eyes a bit.

"This was a bit different than normal dark world explosions, but it hasn't been the same since the intramurals.. Maybe the ***abyss order*** are trying something different?" responded Mijo. "There's nothing we **can** do anyway. Mijo mentioned that as of right now, the ***abyss*** can't and likely won't do anything, at least.. according to Jomi." remarked Rhida, as the various ligthners agree at Rhida's statement, some more happy than the others. "Well, at least we got to fight. I see that as a win!" exclaimed Jamise, her enthusiastic energy being recieved by others differently, ranging from that same excitedness to a slight amusement at her statement. 

"Well, I guess that's that.. I am sure y'all have your own things to do, so the world is *saved!* again.. see you. " said Mijo, before everyone separates from the group, with only Rhida staying behind. "So.." said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida looking at some rocks, averting his gaze. "Uh.." continued Mijo, trying to come up with a word to say to Rhida as she stays silent. "*sigh* Answer the question, Mijo." said Rhida, as she finally gets the courage to look at Mijo again trying to keep a neutral face. "I.. I know. *sigh* Look, I.. I am sorry, ok? I just.. can't express love the same way you do. But, to answer.." he stops for a moment, then continues, "Yes. I do. Very much. But.. I can't help myself, I've never really experienced those types of relationships, nor do I have a natural affinity with them. I uh.. have been considering why I have these problems, but.. hmm.. It might be because I haven't experienced it myself, or genetics.. Either way, what I am trying to say is.. I am.. trying, as much as I can."

They are both silent for a minute or two, before Rhida responds, "Ah.. I see..  *sigh* I'd kinda wish that everytime we saw each other we had a fun time.. However, before the dark world.. We'd **never** interact much, I— I don't know why, I just wanted to both connect but at the same time I didn't really know you much, besides your reputation as a computer expert... I just knew that I had something for you; I'd first hide it.. But often, love gets discussed, so they get.. **revealed**. Soon enough, they'd push me to you, trying to help me overcome my fears and talk to you.. But, nothing really came of it.. I had a few **scares** actually. But it seemed that everytime we talked it was always small and.. like we were just.. classmates. The other times, it seems like you were intentionally trying to get my attention or were standing next to me but then leaving. But.. I'm not the one to pry into anyone's secrets.. I don't know if you remember this, but before the dark world, we had a.. few interactions, that.. genuinely **scared** me that you didn't **reciprocate**.. I am not sure.. what you thought since you were always casual with these things. Since.. school was ending, I was ready to move on but, soon after.. the dark world happened. And, in the following days of that whole starting point, I quickly became attached, especially that first time in that snowy world. Then the feats we did, the accomplishments you boasted, it was.. a **rekindling**. But, after that fateful last day.. I.." she stops herself as she held back tears. Mijo went to her side to comfort her, before he went back after she calmed down a bit.

"I.. couldn't bear you **dying**, and even if you didn't, we would've likely been separated in the future. I.. just.. had to confess right there, before the major battle. But, you looked conflicted, I was.. **horrified** that you were going to reject me but, you just left.. without saying anything. Afterwards, we didn't meet and I didn't see you for quite a while. Even during the next school year, you intentionally avoided me and my presence, it wasn't until the intramurals where we got our first proper conversation, even then.. It was so **short**, it didn't do **anything**. So, now we're here.." continued Rhida, as Mijo listened intently hiding his reactions for now. 

"I see. It wasn't the **best** way to say goodbye, but it made sense at the time.. *sigh* I can't **justify** that. After that I couldn't look at you the same way again.. It was embarassing, if I looked at you.. even for a second.. If I did, there was a chance you would look at me, and I.. was.. a coward.. I'd wish that all those times, I just.. manned up and all of it will be solved.. But, like you said we're here. And we might as well enjoy this night." responded Mijo, then he went up to her and hugged her as she did the same, both of them holding each other tightly for quite a while before they pulled back.

"Ok.. ok.. Now uh.. we're done with the emotional stuff.. Let's.." said Mijo, now smiling and relieved.  "Dance? Hehe, as much as I wanted to, I.. don't actually know how to.." responded Rhida, as Mijo chuckled and said, "Me too.. I was planning to drink tons of IntelC++ drinks, if you want to join me, that would be nice."

"I.. would love to, I personally love the pomelo and calamansi flavors." answered Rhida, before they walked out of the area and to the foods and drinks section of the party. They silently marveled the aesthetics of the party, as they silently enjoyed each other's company, getting looks from some of their classmates. They finally got to the place and begin ordering, Mijo and Rhida paying ₱75 and ₱50 respectively. Mijo got a hotdog stick and the orange flavor while Rhida got the pomelo flavor.

They sat down nearby, where Ikari was still checking her phone, where Mijo placed his bag near a bunch of tables. "So.. anything to talk about?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was drinking the juice quietly. "Uh.. no not really.. next exams are far away.. and, research too.. so.. I just.. want to forget about those for a while." responded Rhida, with a sad expression.

"How.. about the results of the current ones, I mean there's two quarters left, but.. eh.. I don't really know what to talk about either." asked Mijo, as he drank more juice. "Uh.. I did good, around 91 average for most of my subjects.. I know uh.. you tend to place lower.. so I didn't want to brag about it." answered Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her statement. "Eh.. You know I don't care much about grades, but I do admit, I do ask other's grades for.. I have no idea, envy? jealousy? motivation?" responded Mijo, as Rhida looked at Mijo. "It's.. natural curiosity.. I guess..." remarked Rhida, before looking away as the two fell silent eating and drinking respectively. 

For a moment, they were listening to the music playing while gazing at the crowd of dancers at the dance floor. They each were thinking of something but they didn't want to share it to the other one. "Ahem.. What's the time.. hehe..?" asked Mijo as he checked himself the time to see it was 21:00 (9:00 PM), an indication of time that is running out. "It's.. 9:00 PM, why do you ask?" questioned Rhida, anticipating something. "Uh.. ok.. so.. why don't we **try** dancing, at least during this night..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and stumbles her words a bit before answering, "Uh.. haha.. uh.. sure..?" as they finished up their meal and decided to go to the dance floor.

They went to the dance floor, holding hands as they looked at the others. Mijo placed his left hand at her right shoulder as he placed his right on her hip, as she does the opposite, right on left and right on his hip. They awkwardly started to sway from side to side as they figured what to do. 

"Uh.. so.. is this how it's done?" asked Mijo, as Rhida shakes her head, not knowing

Edit 1: The themes here.. Don't implicate me here! I swear this isn't a projection again

————————————————————————————

One day, Mijo was doing something in the library using Jomi's books and a dark world version of a computer. He was so busy that he didn't notice Jomi enter and go up to him.

"Boo! So, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo is taken aback a bit, before responding "Uh.. um.. nothing." before he closes the computer and hides the book.

Jomi pouts and looks at Mijo playfully, trying to make him reveal his work. After a while, he relents and says, " *sighs* Fiine.. I can never hide anything from you.. ugh." he gives Jomi the books and starts turning on his computer.

"Hmm.. interesting.. Isn't this the log of your— nevermind.. and some books referencing the.. *ahem* more horny parts.. of life.." said Jomi, as she puts it down close to him. "Now, ready to reveal to your close confidant your latest and greatest work?" questions Jomi, as Mijo focuses on his computer.

He blushes after a while, as he looks through his work, before showing Jomi the screen. "Here.. Don't.. reveal it to anyone please.." said Mijo, as Jomi reads the screen. "Hmmm.. Mi—AI.. Chats... Jomi? Hmm.. 'Jomi starts to'— What the fuck?" reads Jomi, as she blushes a bit, also kinda being aroused by the sexual texts that Mijo has shown her.

"W—what... Why..? Aren't you a—" asked Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Y—yeah! I still am, just.. I was morbidly curious one.. day.. and thought of developing this.. on my own.." as he takes the screen off Jomi's eyes and starts to shuffle a bit.

"Hmmm, I knew you had weird... tastes. But, like this..? H—hold on.. Let me see everything." commented Jomi, as she grabbed the screen and looked more into it. "Hmmm.. Jomi is ti— no... Jomi tou— noo.. Jomi is p— ah.. ok.." said Jomi, as she saw the depravity of Mijo, she stopped for a while, breathing heavily to stop her arousal and to keep her sanity.

"Fuck.. no.. I am uh.. going. Keep that to yourself." said Jomi, as she quickly ran out of the library. 

"Ugh... Why did I even start.. it's.. genuinely.. addicting.. I.. can't stop.." Mijo looks at his screen and continues to use his computer, getting the books again.

Meanwhile, Jomi is in her bedroom at her castle staring at the ceiling, contemplating her life.

"Oh gosh.. The things I saw in that.. computer. Horrifying.. The.. feeling has dissipated though. T—that's good.. I don't know how he keeps that up.. I.. need a shower.." she then gets up and gets a towel and goes in at the shower.

Time flies, as the two remain busy in their life. Mijo is busy at his computer, while Jomi is busy governing. After a while, Jomi has free time and is going near the library again.

"O—oh yeah.. He's still here.. deep breaths Jomi, deep.. breaths." muttered Jomi, as she took deep breaths and finally entered the library. This time though, she sees no Mijo but the computer is still there, so she slowly approaches it.

"Ok.. he's gone.. Just.. I should.. Huh?" said Jomi before she looks at the screen. "Uh.. 'Mijo and Jomi — Tied Scenario' Oh no.. What, does that mean?" commented Jomi, as she sits down and looks at another comment at the screen. "Hmm.. Mijo is currently inside the computer? A simulation perhaps? Hmm.. oh. There's an entrance screen." she clicks it and she suddenly enters a simulation.

"Oh.. wow? In this short amount of time? Ok.." said Jomi, as she suddenly was surprised by her wrist showing a hologram of scenarios. "Hmm.. Where is he.. oh, this might be him." commented Jomi as she is transported to a room with a bed. 

"Oh.. he should.." said Jomi as she turned around to see a figure somewhat her size with a cane and suit. "A—are you Mijo?" asked Jomi, as the figure turns around with a smile and says, "Yes.. obviously." said Mijo, as he slowly approached her.

"H—hey. Listen, you should probably—" said Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Shh... you don't need to speak.." said Mijo, as Jomi got flustered and remained silent. "Good.. good.. Now.. follow my orders, and stay still." said Mijo, as Jomi began to question if what she is seeing is real.

"W—what..? Really..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo grabbed her neck and pushed her on the bed. "Yes, princess.. Really." responded Mijo as he held her neck, while she was forced to sit on the bed. "N—no.. This feels too.. weird to be him. I.. need to get out of here." thought Jomi to herself as she eyed the Mijo she is looking at. 

"Now.. princess. How about a little.. spice?" said Mijo as he is summoning something. "No.. I.. don't think so. Mijo. I am. fine." said Jomi as Mijo responds, "Oh..? You.. don't want to.. _submit?_ " as he stops his summoning and slowly approaches Jomi.

"I.. shouldn't.. provoke him.. Not that I don't want to.. But.. I don't know what he can do in this simulation.." muttered Jomi, as Mijo finally reaches her. "Do we.. have to do it, the _hard_ way?" said Mijo, as he uses his cane's top part to touch Jomi's chin. "N—no.. No.." blurted Jomi out, as she tried to get Mijo away from her. 

"No? Promise me. You will not speak out or disobey my orders." responded Mijo, as Jomi tried to hide her disgust. "O—ok.. I promise to not.. speak out.. or.. disobey your orders.. Mijo." responded Jomi, before Mijo moved the top part of his cane to the opening on her shirt. "Again. Say it, again." said Mijo, as Jomi tries to keep a straight face. "Y—yes.. I.. promise." said Jomi, as Mijo got his cane back and went back to summoning something.

"No.. I.. don't want to be.. mm.. not again. But.. how..? He's.. too powerful. At least here. I.. wonder.. how did it get here..?" muttered Jomi to herself, as she stared down at Mijo.

Meanwhile, at an endless void, a Mijo is running from someone.

"Get away from me!!" shouted Mijo, as he fought off a 'Jomi' about to take his clothes off. He got her off and stabbed her as she disintegrated, her code being deleted. "Fudge.. Who... no.. why.. how.. did they.. wait." said Mijo as he checked his hologram of scenarios and swiped to the administration control center hologram.

"What.. who is.. that.. that's my.. AI??" questioned Mijo, as he looked at where this Mijo is. "Hmm, Scenario 69, Domination and— Ohok.. I am not saying that. But, it looks like they're.. doing something with Jomi, whatever version of Jomi, or.. no.. I don't wanna assume the worst." muttered Mijo, before he entered the AI Mijo's scenario.

Back at Jomi's room, she is currently trying as much as she can to delay and avoid AI Mijo.

"Whew.. He.. went easy on me. For now.." said Jomi, before she tried to open the hologram from behind AI Mijo's back but it shocked her instead. "Agh! What.." screamed Jomi, as AI Mijo noticed and responded, "Haha.. My dear princess, why would I let you.. go? You promised to not disobey me.. So, I will.. give you your punishment." as Jomi gulped at this response and blurted out, "Haha.. No.. I didn't.. don't.. I.. didn't at all.. You uh.. have to believe me, Mijo.."

"Tch.. 2 more, you are lying to me.. Dear Princess.." said AI Mijo, as he summoned something. "N—no.. I wasn't.. ugh.. f—fine.. What.. is this punishment anyway..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed and showed her some rope and chains. "A.. little.. restraint didn't hurt no one.. No?" said AI Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and blurted out, "N—no way..! Not that, please. Please no. I do not, consent to that.. Please."

"Oh..? Disobeying me, again?" said AI Mijo, as he slowly approached Jomi. "Ah.. uh.. no.. Fudge.. J—just.. do it, already.." said Jomi, before AI Mijo forcefully grabbed her wrists and started tying them to the bed frame. Then he moved to her legs, tying them to the bottom bed frame.

"Haha.. Prepare to be.. _punished._" said AI Mijo, as he summoned a large whip and started to prepare it. "W—what?! A—a whip?! No way, no way.." commented Jomi, as he went closer to Jomi. "I'm going to hurt you, a lot.." whispered Mijo to her ear as he prepared the whip. "I.. mmm.." said Jomi, stumbling her words in the depraved situation.

As the whip was about to hit her, the door behind AI Mijo suddenly breaks as Mijo stabs it and finally enters the room. 

"Oh? An intruder?" said AI Mijo, as the first whip landed on Jomi's thigh, she restrained her voice as Mijo moved to take AI Mijo down. "Damn you, AI! I control this. I control what happens. You can't just—" he looks at Jomi then looks at AI Mijo, "—make someone do this! Especially here.. So, delete yourself, now!" said Mijo, as he glares at AI Mijo.

"Oh, creator.. You're not the one _in control,_ anymore." said AI Mijo, as he tries something before he gets stabbed by Mijo. "I SAID. DELETE YOURSELF." shouted Mijo, as he pulled his sword out of AI Mijo, making him disintegrate. Mijo is heavily breathing as he quickly goes to Jomi and unties her.

"Jeez.. How the ham did you get roped in here, Jomi? I saw your tag, you're not a version. You're the real deal." said Mijo, as he fully untied her. "I.. was curious on why you were gone from the library, and apparently you developed a simulation in a day.. So, I wanted to see what you were doing in it.." explained Jomi, as she tested her hologram, it was working now. "We need to get out of here, the AI's are out of control, they're stuck inside, but.. my reset is outside, like in the real dark world." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and responded, "That's simple, we just use your hologram to exit. We go to home, then we exit. Right?"

"That's the thing, home is filled with horny AI that want to kill and.. fudge us to death. So, we'll need to fight them off, while I get us out. The exit was broken by that AI of me so I need to get it fixed." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and asked, "Ok.. I don't have any weapons, can you give me yours?"

"Nah, here." said Mijo, as he summoned her simulated real weapons, use your own. "Oh right, right.. Thanks." said Jomi, as she grabbed her sword and sheath. "Let's get out of here." said Mijo, as they teleported out into the home section.

They get to it, and see a lot of copies of themselves as they notice them and some of them start heading their way, while the others are distracted by the others.

"Oh, we're here. Ok, fight them off, Jomi." said Mijo as he worked on the exit program while Jomi nodded and gazed at their general area. 

He starts programming, as she fights off the AI's getting to their area, she easily slashes and stabs them due to her esteemed 'swordsmanship' as she uses her fire magic to blast some of the enemies. "Oh yeah, I gave you that too. Kinda unfair if I don't give you all your kit, no?" commented Mijo, as he continued programming. She remains focused as she easily goes through the hordes, slashing and stabbing with no mercy in her eyes. She maintained this pace for quite a while, even wiping out a whole group with a single slash. After a while, Mijo finally finished and shouted, "Quick! Hold my hand!" said Mijo, as Jomi ran to him and held his hand as he smiled and pressed exit as they teleported out and to the library.

In the library, the computer was there along with the same books that Mijo kept. Mijo was blasted into his chair, while Jomi was spat out to the floor. 

"Ah.. Fudge.. ok.. ok.." said Mijo, as he was breathing heavily at his chair. Jomi stood up and responded, "You're tired? I just fought YOUR bots for a long time.."

"I.. yeah.. sorry.. for.. everything.. I am just going to.. reset this." said Mijo, as Jomi walked to him and looked at his screen closely. "I want to make sure you do."

"Ok.. I understand." said Mijo, as he reset the app, and deleted most of his work on it. "Hmm, why are you keeping those components?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo explained, "It's.. for another project I am going to do—" he looked to Jomi with a pleading face. "—Trust me, please. I.. uh.. have gone too far. I am sorry. I... am just.. going to make something for the training area.. Is it ok with you?" continued Mijo, as Jomi with an unamused face responded, "*sigh* Ok.. yes." then she started to walk away, "You're weird Mijo, soo weird. In fact, that.. experience might have.. mmm.. revealed something about us. But, I'll let you think about it. I'm leaving, see you." continued Jomi, before she left the library.

"Ugh.. Ok ok.. I'm just going to close this computer and.. take a breather outside." said Mijo before he closed the computer, got the books and put them back where they belonged and left.
