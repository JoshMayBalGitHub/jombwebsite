Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:

Leviente dirst

Summary: 

Author's Note: A student kills every darkner in the dark world lol. Also no relation to Canon Mijo btw.

Mijo wakes up after falling into a dark world in the classroom, he sees his student uniform worn down, and only a revolver with around enough ammo to survive for a day or so. 

Mijo said, "Ah shit, I'm screwed. I only have a revolver, at yun lang. Sana makakita ako ng ibang tao..."

So he got up and walked.. At first the darkness was... calming but soon it turned into dread as sound everywhere of something. Then he saw a huge field, filled with computer setups that have cabinets. 

He jumped down there and immediately a monster started attacking him and so he shot it but the monster relented. Mijo was knocked and hit a bunch of the setups, he kept shooting at the monster, but he was eventually knocked down and was about to die until...

Jamise shouted, "Hey! Get away from my Friend!!!" before shooting the monster and the monster decided to chase her instead.

Mijo was so hurt that he began to drift away to unconsciousness until a certain voice called out to him.

Urda said, "Yo, don't die on me Mijo, aalis tayo dito kasama ang lahat, yun yung sinabi ni Jamise sakin.." then she healed him. 

Barely enough that Mijo can walk because her magic was exhausted as well.

Mijo said, "Thanks. Jamise would do that huh, well we should go. Gusto ko din umalis bro.."

So Mijo got up and walked with Urda towards Jamise where she was fighting with the monster.

Jamise shouted, "Mamatay ka!! Putang inang halimaw!" before shooting the monster until it was dead.

'Hey,

"I am staying here. You don't have a clue on
how the Light World works." said Mijo.

"I'm just saying, you can survive the light world right?" said Jomi.

"No. The Light world sucks, it just is." said Mijo.

"Mijo, I'm concerned with what you are thinking about here, isn't the light world fun too?" said Jomi.

"You know, why I'm here, but incase you haven't thought much about it, I AM DONE WITH LIFE ON THE LIGHT WORLD. SCHOOL, hurts. The STRESS AND PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW- I WANNA ENJOY the world here." said Mijo.

"But Mijo, please, just let her go by closing the portal." said Jomi.

"No, NO! She can go off on her own, that's fine, you CAN teach her right? Just let her go then. I will be staying here. For the future." said Mijo.

"Well, Mijo, it will be unfavorable to both of you, if you guys get separated in the worlds, trust me." said Jomi.

"I Guess, but I dont wanna go back out there, where problems are way harder, just staying here is good enough for me." said Mijo.

"I understand, but this isn't your world. You belong there, its like with me but in the light world. You can have as much fun as you want here but you have to go back, don't you have friends to talk to?" said Jomi.

"I... do. But they don't need me. They do fine on their own, i wanna stay here. Even if that means forever locking the lithium room." said Mijo.

"I... can't let you do that, I'm.. you and you are me, you know this isn't right." said Jomi.

"Well, then I will just have to go out myself." said Mijo before drawing his sword.

"Look, i don't wanna fight but if you want to... i can." said Jomi before drawing her sword.

"OK OK LETS DO THIS!!!" said Mijo before attacking.

They fought but eventually Jomi was defeated with a surprise scabbard to the stomach.

"Hah... That was fun. But I have to go, to new areas. Good luck! I know you'll survive, and I'll meet you again!" said Mijo, before walking away, towards the gate that leads to the grass outside.

"Jomi!" shouted Ikari, from the fountain room.

"Are you fine? Are you ok?" said Ikari, worried.

"I'm fine, i have healing powers. Just go after him, before he does something rash." said Jomi pointing to her hand with a green glow.

"UH, are you sure I can take him, I mean you got defeated right here!" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I don't know. Find. Out. I can't really get you out of here without him, so... Good Luck?"
said Jomi, clearly having her fingers crossed.

"Uh, sige, mamatay naman din ako anyway, uh sasama ka ba?" said Ikari.

"Soon. I guess you can fight hanggang makapunta ako." said Jomi.

"Ok... See ya'!" said Ikari before going to the same door that Mijo went.

<!--Attempt at Fight Scene-->
<p id="R4"><md-block># Random DR Fight</md-block></p>

One day, in the Playas Cemetery....

"I... don't know what to say, honestly.." said Mijo.

"Yeah, guess so, but you can get the advice of our dead family over here." said Jomi.

"What? But I have my parents right there!" said Mijo, pointing to his parents.

"Can they even see me?" said Jomi.

"Oh definitely, I just said that you were a friend in school that also went here." said Mijo.

"Right, and they won't notice the... similarities?" said Jomi.

"Think so, i'll just say it's a coincidence, and besides, no one will look that far unless they're my friends..." said Mijo.

"Ok... and they won't notice how I have no parents or where they even are???" said Jomi.

"Relax... We're here to talk about life and.. Her. Don't worry, I gooot this. If I need help, I'll ask you, ok?" said Mijo.

"Alright, alright, I don't trust you, but you are the only one that can do anything about that, anyways, so-" said Jomi,

Before a large dark fountain opened right in the center of the cemetery, Mijo and Jomi quickly rushed to see what was happening, but got sucked into the dark world before seeing the fountain opener. They landed at the part where the fountain was, but it was basically the cemetery but dark, so off they go exploring again.

"Ah shit, didn't got time to-" said Mijo.

"Ok, relax Mijo, it's just a dark world, the only thing we need to do is quickly close it, so nothing significant happens." said Jomi.

"Good point, but if the fountain isn't here then..." said Mijo, thinking then he said, "Maybe..." before getting cut off by Jomi.

"Oh, its right there!" Jomi points to the fountain near where they were just talking in the light world.

"Sweet, it's one of those easy ones." said Mijo.

They quickly rushed to the fountain and as Mijo was closing it, someone blasted Mijo away from the fountain.

"Oof, sino ka!" said Mijo as he gets up.

"Hahaha... What's up!" said someone.

"Wait, you are... Cajo!" said Jomi.

"Who the fuck is Cajo?" said Mijo.

"Let me introduce myself, so you know how those dark fountains open without you? That's me!" said Cajo.

"What? No, that was Doctor G and Cara right?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, and I work with them, I opened those, not them." said Cajo.

"Ok... Who are you, lightner? darkner? Just who are you exactly?" said Mijo.

"Oh, uh... I come from nowhere!" said Cajo.

"Really, you can't even say where you even come from?" said Jomi.

"WHAT? Do you know me?" said Cajo.

"Well actually yes, you are Cajo, the lightner that was dissatisfied... I guess you got broken out by those two..." said Jomi.

"Oh, OH! YOU... You. Ikaw ah... Papatayin ko kita ngayon!!" said Cajo.

"Nope, not on my watch." said Mijo.

"Ok, Mijo. LET'S DANCE!" said Cajo.

<p id="R5"><md-block># C5S2 Scattered Ideas</md-block></p>

Ok so its basically just my ideas and suggestions for dialogues because I can't figure out how to connect these together properly

*Scenario 1: Rhida and Mijo Post-BSBH, during C5S2*

Mijo and Rhida are left alone in the tent, as Jomi says she has to plan and prepare a lot for the future battle. "So, I have to go.. Um, uh.. you two. Stay cool, ok?" Jomi smiles and leaves.

"So.. how has life been?" said Mijo, as he and Rhida are the most far away they can be inside a tent. "It's fine.. you..?" responded Rhida, with a dismissive tone. "It's been.. rough, to be honest. But, I am sure you probably don't want to hear about it.." answered Mijo, as the tent went silent for a while.

"Well.. what do you think of the dark world here..? It's another huge change from the old ones.." asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about her answer. "It's different.. I guess.. But..." answered Rhida, before trailing off and stopped talking.

"But..? But what..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida pondered the question. "But.. I don't feel excited.. nor.. scared. Just.. I literally don't have anything to say about it." continued Rhida, as the tent went silent once again, with only the sound of the lightbulb and electric fan nearby keeping the room from being totally silent.

"I.. don't know either.." said Mijo, as he looks at her, unsure of what to think or say. "When this is all over, we'll go back to before, again. It's the final school year.. of this era.." continued Mijo, reflecting on the past 3 years.

"Before..? I am more afraid of what might change afterwards.. At least, before..." responded Rhida, stopping herself before finishing her words. "I.. get it. *sigh* I just.. have a lot of thoughts.. I've been thinking about the future, and the past a lot these days in the dark world.." said Mijo, as he looked away, a bit worried.

"Nothing to do..? I mean, don't you have a lot of responsibilities here?" questioned Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her question. "Well.. yes.. but, I don't really have a.. choice when I think about it, it's just.. you know a lot of preparation and logistics are needed so, I often drift off looking at the night sky, while waiting for news and stuff.. Mmm.. Even.. nevermind." answered Mijo, before standing up. "That reminds me, we should go to Jomi." said Mijo, more montone as Rhida stood up and they went out of the tent.

*Scenario 2: Rhida and Mijo are paired by Jomi in some random mission using a new device she prepared (for them but they don't know that)*

"So, here's the device, it's my.. all new Chalo! It's a voice-to-text chat log, so just enable it and it should record and put it into text for logging. Good luck!" said Jomi, as she left to do more rebel leader work, giving it to Mijo.

"Hey! Why did.. you.." Mijo tried to call out, but Jomi was already gone. "Well.. we're already here.. right Rhida?"

"Yeah..? But, I don't get it.. She hasn't even told me about that.. So, I assume it's for your eyes..? But.. she did invite me here and left, so.. I can only assume she wanted me to stay here?" Rhida thought out loud, as Mijo was using the device.

"Hmm.. Oh, it has a note on the back of the screen." Mijo noticed a sticky note on the back of the chat log screen, with black ink:

'In case I forget, go to Mijo's tent or something ;)'

"My tent..? What.. oh whatever.. Let's go Rhida." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they headed to Mijo's tent and entered it as they sat down with the machine.

"Activating Protocol Number 69, smug smiley face." said the robotic voice as it starts trapping them in the tent with magic, then starts releasing a small gas payload that quickly fills up the tent.

"W—what.. is this..?" Rhida is a bit hazy, as she feels warm for no reason. "Oh fudge.. What's.. what the fudge is this..?" Mijo feels something rising and it's not just heat.

"Ah.. Um.." Rhida is shaking as she looks at the screen, the robot's message being displayed as well as what she just said. "Wait.. this.. isn't.." Mijo gasped and looked at the screen, displaying a smug smile. "No.. this is.. an aphrodisiac.."

"What..? What?!! Aphrodisiac..? What.. why..? Please explain.." said Rhida, she tried to cool herself down with a nearby electric fan, but she remained bothered by her feelings. "It's.. basically to increase.. a certain arousal.." explained Mijo, as he fiddled with the machine.

"A—arousal?! What?! What did she.. want us to do..? We're still teens.. we haven't done it.. But, it's getting harder and harder.. to resist.. Please.." Rhida says as she attempts to leave but her arousal is too much so she doesn't move much.

Mijo tried to use his electrical magic but due to his haziness he was unable to materialize anything as Rhida tried the same with her ice magic to cool herself down, also failing. "Ok.. Plan B.. Maybe.. just maybe.." Mijo says before Rhida looks at him, wanting. "Yeah? I know what you're thinking.." Rhida approaches Mijo, and their faces are now close to each other, then after looking at each other for a while, they share a passionate kiss.

They pull back, and look at each other again. "First kiss..?" asked Mijo as Rhida shook her head. "No actually.. but.. it's.. good to share it with you, is it.. your first?"

"Well, with anyone outside my family.. Yeah, It's.. I guess, weird hah?" Mijo comments as Rhida caresses his torso. "Not really.." Rhida looks at Mijo, unsure of what to do. "What.. I don't want to do anything you don't want, Rhida.. Even in this.. haze." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at him putting up a smile.

"Thanks.. Let's just.." said Rhida, before Mijo kissed Rhida's forehead, making her gasp. "I am sorry.. I just had to, I'd never—"

"It's fine.. d—don't.. we both know we're very.. vulnerable right now.." interrupted Rhida, looking up at Mijo with a flustered expression. Mijo only looked at Rhida for a short while before kissing Rhida again, but this time even more deeper and passionate. They make out for a while before pulling back.

"That was.. intense." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded while looking at each other, still very flustered. "I wonder.. what It'll take for this moment to.. well.. It doesn't matter.. Let's make this last before we regret anything." continued Mijo, as they made out again.

They pulled back after a while and Rhida said,  "I know we shouldn't.. but.. I am so tempted to have.. sex right now.." Mijo chuckled a bit and told her, "Me too.. But.. as long as we're both consenting.. and have proper protection.." Mijo trailed off, wondering if the dark world had condoms or they just used magic.

"Oh, that.. Mijo.. Let's.. let's at least touch each other, without.." asked Rhida, before stopping herself, unsure if she should continue. "Oh..? I think that'll tempt us.. but.. I do want to see you, so.. if you want to, just say the word." answered Mijo, with a thoughtful expression.

Jomi pops inside the tent. "Hey..! Oh.." Rhida and Mijo are in the middle of undressing each other, and look at Jomi all flustered. "Oh..? I see.. I'm genuinely so sorry about.. everything here.." Jomi looks at the device. "Don't mind me.." Jomi is obviously aroused but somehow she manages to stay composed, and fiddle with the machine. "Oh.. a.. prototype protocol.. Wait, why did it enable.." Jomi uses some internal programs to check the protocol. "Oh.. oh.. Ah.. Haha.. It's.. I am sorry.." Jomi types something and the gas starts to dissipate as they are allowed to leave again. Throughout all of it, the duo had been just looking at Jomi, swirling with emotions.

"I have to explain myself, again.. Gosh, I am so sorry.. It's just a lot to explain." said Jomi, as she is showing a shy smile. "Hey.. at least you didn't have to experience.. lust for an absurdly amount of time!" Mijo pouted, with a smile as Rhida quietly dressed up again. 

"Well, I had my fair share.. Anyways, so.. like, I was testing this Chalo thing right? So, after I did some tests one night, I forgot to turn off this experimental protocol, that mixed my.. magic to create.. this—" Jomi gestures to the current room. "So that.. you know, a girl has to.. let out sometimes, get me Rhida?"

"Y—yeah.. But, I didn't expect you to be the type to create stuff like this, I thought Mijo did that?" said Rhida, with a smug smile. "W—what?! J— A—anyways, yeah. I also agree, you're a rebel leader and the dark princess right? So, how did you get the idea for this?" responded Mijo, a bit embarrassed.

"Old books, et cetera... The usual. Hey! You know my relation to Mijo, it'll only make sense haha." answered Jomi, before she gestured for them to leave with her. "Alright. Let's go. Before it gets more awkward, hehe." The three leave the tent, Jomi bringing the Chalo device with her.

 _Scenario 3: Jomi invites the rest of the Dark Pearl to a party / gathering to have fun but a conversation happens, and things get.. spicy._

The Dark Pearl is hanging out, as Mijo is on his corner, sleeping. As he does so, the others talk near him, notably a certain Jomi and Rhida.

"Hey, how's it been? How's.. how's everything, I mean.. it's been a while since we had these types of events.. In fact, I am quite busy this time of the year due to.. the dual power situation.. But, I got a little time to breathe it seems, so.. we're here! That's my story, how 'bout yours, Rhida?" asked Jomi, as Rhida looked at her thoughtfully.

"I've been.. doing fine.. As well, usual school stuff.. I've been working in that Anti-Drug and Journalism Club Stuff.. The usual.. I mean, it's not bad that it's usual, it's just how it is, I guess. The.. hell week hasn't started.. Nor the important stuff for this grading yet.." said Rhida, as she gazed over Mijo, who was still sleeping. "What's with.. him? He's usually the life of the party.. Well, when he's comfortable or course. But, everyone here is his friend.." 

"Oh, yeah.. I don't know, I haven't asked. He arrived and slept on the nearest couch, though.. he usually doesn't sleep in the dark world.. Hold on, let's go to him." responded Jomi, before they walked over to Mijo. "Hmm.. I'll let you wake him up." said Jomi with a small grin, as Rhida also looked at her with a small chuckle.

"Hey.. babe.. ahem. I mean, love— ah! Uh.. Mijo wake up please." Rhida's voice somehow managed to wake up the sleeping Mijo. "Huh..? What do you want.. luv.." Mijo says groggily not realizing Jomi is also there. "Aww.. ah! I mean, yeah.. I just.. We have a couple of questions, hehe.. You can sleep later, right?" answered Rhida, as Mijo takes in his surroundings.

"Ah.. sure." Mijo stands up, towering over Rhida and matching Jomi's height. "Haha.. Sometimes I forget how tall you are. And how small.. You sure you can take it, Rhida?" Jomi says, with a sly smile and wink. "What do you mean.. uh.. HEY! uh.. his height doesn't mean anything. Hmmph." said Rhida, as she looked away.

"Hah? Hold on.. lemme.. ah! You don't have to assume, don't you.. since—" responded Mijo with a sarcastic tone. "HEY! Stop. Please don't mention that. Ever. Remember, we are both implicated." interrupted by Jomi, Rhida is very confused but moves on, expecting the two to not reveal anything yet. "Haha.. Ah.. First Question!" Rhida tried to move on, but she actually hasn't thought of anything.

"Mijo, answer truthfully. Have you, in your life, ever thought of.. sexual things towards us, any one of us? Rhida, me, Urda, everyone you met?" asked Jomi, as Mijo was shocked and was blushing a bit. "Ah! That— Jomi! Isn't that too much..?" asked Rhida, a bit surprised by Jomi's words.

"Ah.. I agree.. but.. you know.. uh.. Ok, well.. with Jomi, quite a lot actually.. Like every month or so, I often wonder what it would be like if we—" answered Mijo, hesitating. "Too much detail. Please.. just.. move on. I have seen it with my own eyes multiple times." interrupted Jomi, before Mijo continued. "Yeah, as for the others.. My.. my.. ah.. I am.. ashamed to admit.. but.. like.. just... ugh.. the photos we had, I.. fancied it for a while."

Mijo looked away, super embarrassed. "Jomi.. That's enough.." Rhida stepped in, regretting what she just heard. "Oh, sorry.. I am just used to teasing him. If you're feeling uncomfortable, don't be afraid to say it." Jomi smiles, as she takes a step back. "Um.. I guess.. that's just how turbulent we are, huh?" said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo's back.

"Alright, let's move on. Mijo, what's the status update to you two, and Rhida?" asked Jomi, as Mijo turned around to face the two, more composed. "Oh? Ask her." 

"Hey! You do it.. Hmph, you're the one that is being questioned, not me!" responded Rhida sarcastically, her smile being directed at Mijo. "Yeah, I want to hear it straight from you, Mijo. What's your deal with Rhida?" asked Jomi, with a small smile.

"Ah.. Well ever since the new dark world, we uh.. we've been together for 2 months. 'Together' as in speaking about random stuff in between battles and school. It's like.. a couple of minutes, I don't think you can consider that developed yet." Mijo explains, a bit neutral as Rhida started off with a thoughtful look.

"Mijo's.. right. We never get to hang out outside of here.. It's just small glances and stuff, because.. I am always so busy, and.. Mijo's often busy too! Only here, we get to share moments.. I just wish that the next student's night was closer.. so we could hang out again." added Rhida with Mijo also saying, "Hopefully no problems.."

"Haha.. I get you. My life's workload has significantly increased this time.. Mmm.. I should probably consider getting more people.. Ah, forget about it. You two have a lot in mind already." said Jomi, before Rhida asked another question, with questionable intent. "I have a question, how do you deal.. with your dailies Jomi? Me and Mijo are students, right? So, I am genuinely curious.. what do you do everyday? You never told us in detail.."

"Ah.. Well, I can tell you a little.." Jomi stops and looks at their eyes before sitting down. "So, I wake up, cook and eat my food.. Since, huh.. I should get a chef.. Anyway, after that, I shower and get dressed in casual clothes, or a dress.. the battle one. The casual ones, depend actually, mayor wear, and.. whatever I can scrounge up and put into my closet. I do the boring political stuff, you get it.. Then I have lunch, then dinner, and go to bed.. Um, in those like.. times, I can visit.. so.. it's not that I don't have time.. but, uh.. more.. important things to do, haha." answered Jomi, to the amusement of the other two.

"Wow. Just like I expected, yes!" said Mijo, happy about Jomi's routine. "Haha, you know me a lot, Mijo. In fact, you know me as you know yourself." said Jomi with a smirk, as she looked at Mijo's eyes. "I do, huh.." Mijo trails off,  not knowing what to respond next.

"Alright, you know what, you two. I have a *'surprise'* for you. Come with me." said Jomi, confusing the other two. "Jomi, what's this _surprise?_ of yours?" asked Rhida, as Jomi smiled while directly looking at Rhida. "Trust me, you'll both enjoy it." Jomi winks at both of them.

They reluctantly follow Jomi, going up the stairs and going by rooms of unknown occupancy as they arrive at a colored door, yellow and light blue mixed with a wavy pattern. "We're here, now I'd prepare if I was you." said Jomi with sarcastic undertones. Before any of the two could speak, Jomi opened the door and it contained a huge queen-sized bed with small tables on either side packed with cabinets.

"Jomi..? Tell me that I am wrong on what you're thinking, right now." said Mijo, before Jomi grinned at him and left the room. Locking the door behind her with magic. Before the two could react, an aphrodisiac gas suddenly started to fill the room, coming from exhaust pipes on the roof.

"H—hey! Jomi, you wingwoman! Stop forcing us in.. these situations!" said Rhida, as her body heated up. "Y—yeah.. I think we're stuck here until we.. uh.. do the thing." added Mijo, as his body also heated up, his hardness being obvious to Rhida.

"E—eh..? Mijo.." said Rhida, as she noticed his bulge. "It's.. a natural response!" responded Mijo, as he looked away, ashamed and blushing. "I—It's my fault too.. I shouldn't be looking.." said Rhida, as she looked away too, flustered.

Jomi knocks at the door and says, "Ah hold on, I think I left something there." Jomi opens the door and looks at the two flustered lovebirds, then goes to the cabinets. "How are _you_ not affected, Jomi?" asked Mijo, as Jomi went through the cabinets. "Oh? I am, Mijo. I just.. have a certain tolerance now." explained Jomi, as she brought out a purple vibrator. "Hey! Isn't that a—" asked Rhida before Jomi interrupted, "Don't mention it. I was.. using this room before. Both of you understand, no?" Mijo and Rhida nodded. "Well, are you going to turn the gas off?" asked Mijo, as he started to tremble due to the intense arousal. "Sure." Jomi uses her magic to turn the device off but she accidentally transferred a lot of it's essence to the two. "Ah! Oh no.. My bad, uh.. enjoy? It should last a while, but it dissipates. How long it is? That's for you to find out. Tell it to me when you're done, capiche? Ok." Jomi leaves and closes the door.

_Scenario 4: Exams are nearing, and so is the pressure and stress. Mijo is looking out of a balcony, with so many unfinished tasks, he's beginning to lose it_

Mijo is listening to somber melancholic music, as he looks out to the intense rain happening right in front of him.

"I am a failure..." Mijo says, as he looks out, alone with his thoughts. "I can't keep up. I can't. The pressure.. it.. broke me." Mijo continues, as he continues to be alone in his own thoughts.

"I am no longer fit to be any position of power." Mijo says again, repeating his own thoughts. "I should.. listen, and stay dead. The willpower? Gone. That fire? Gone." Mijo continued, tears almost flowing out before he stopped himself.

"No one's here to comfort me. Rhida's busy with research, Kai (Ikari) and Lauv (Lauvielle), they've both gone home. Urda's on some, random stuff.. But, she's still busy. I know that perfectly well." Mijo looks to his right, seeing Urda with some of her other friends. Mijo looks back to the rain, he felt the rain getting more intense, he's not sure if it's his imagination anymore.

"It's lucky.. that we even got a half day today. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do." Mijo looked to his left, he sees JR walking out. But then, Lauvielle appeared and he looked away. "That's probably for research, forget about it. I don't think they need more of.. this." said Mijo, before he picked up his bag and left his spot. 

He went down the stairs, noticing the flooding on his feet. Then he walked slowly through the corridors of the school, passing by people worried for their research. Afterwards, he walked past his old classrooms. "Oh.. these.."  murmured Mijo to himself, as he continued walking. Soon after, he arrived at a waiting area. He noticed Ikari there.

"Kai..?" said Mijo, as he went closer to her. "Yeah, it's me! You're stuck here too? Are you commuting? The rain's really heavy right now..!" said Ikari, as he put down his bags nearby. "Yeah, I am commuting.. I just have to wait for this to end." said Mijo as he watched the rain fall. Ikari noticed his unusual attitude, he was nonchalant, but he's... too calm. But, she didn't push it, she had her own problems anyway.

"Yeah, I am waiting for my dad, which by the way, was supposed to be arriving.. thirty minutes ago!" ranted Ikari, as she also watched the rain. "Oh, that's.. funny.. haha." remarked Mijo, his laugh being a bit more fake than she expected. "Hmph. You're lucky. My dad's arriving after that online quiz is done, plus my bilao painting." joked Ikari, as she waited impatiently for her dad.

"Oh, cool." said Mijo, a bit nonchalant. "Mijo! The water.. it's.. overflowing the drainage, quick! Let's go!" said Ikari, noticing the flooding and another nearby elevated waiting area. Mijo nods and they head there, making their shoes wet but the clothes not so much. They arrive at the other waiting area, catching their breath. "Whew.. it's a good thing this piece of shit plastic envelope didn't fail and my laptop died from one drop of rainwater." commented Ikari, as she washed off the droplets of rain on her envelope.

"Haha.. yeah.." responded Mijo, trying to keep up with the conversation. "Anyways.. This mfer.. is going to take as long as if I walked home, twice!" continued Ikari, as she frantically looked at her phone.
