Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:

Leviente dirst

Summary: 

Author's Note: A student kills every darkner in the dark world lol. Also no relation to Canon Mijo btw.

Mijo wakes up after falling into a dark world in the classroom, he sees his student uniform worn down, and only a revolver with around enough ammo to survive for a day or so. 

Mijo said, "Ah shit, I'm screwed. I only have a revolver, at yun lang. Sana makakita ako ng ibang tao..."

So he got up and walked.. At first the darkness was... calming but soon it turned into dread as sound everywhere of something. Then he saw a huge field, filled with computer setups that have cabinets. 

He jumped down there and immediately a monster started attacking him and so he shot it but the monster relented. Mijo was knocked and hit a bunch of the setups, he kept shooting at the monster, but he was eventually knocked down and was about to die until...

Jamise shouted, "Hey! Get away from my Friend!!!" before shooting the monster and the monster decided to chase her instead.

Mijo was so hurt that he began to drift away to unconsciousness until a certain voice called out to him.

Urda said, "Yo, don't die on me Mijo, aalis tayo dito kasama ang lahat, yun yung sinabi ni Jamise sakin.." then she healed him. 

Barely enough that Mijo can walk because her magic was exhausted as well.

Mijo said, "Thanks. Jamise would do that huh, well we should go. Gusto ko din umalis bro.."

So Mijo got up and walked with Urda towards Jamise where she was fighting with the monster.

Jamise shouted, "Mamatay ka!! Putang inang halimaw!" before shooting the monster until it was dead.

'Hey,

"I am staying here. You don't have a clue on
how the Light World works." said Mijo.

"I'm just saying, you can survive the light world right?" said Jomi.

"No. The Light world sucks, it just is." said Mijo.

"Mijo, I'm concerned with what you are thinking about here, isn't the light world fun too?" said Jomi.

"You know, why I'm here, but incase you haven't thought much about it, I AM DONE WITH LIFE ON THE LIGHT WORLD. SCHOOL, hurts. The STRESS AND PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW- I WANNA ENJOY the world here." said Mijo.

"But Mijo, please, just let her go by closing the portal." said Jomi.

"No, NO! She can go off on her own, that's fine, you CAN teach her right? Just let her go then. I will be staying here. For the future." said Mijo.

"Well, Mijo, it will be unfavorable to both of you, if you guys get separated in the worlds, trust me." said Jomi.

"I Guess, but I dont wanna go back out there, where problems are way harder, just staying here is good enough for me." said Mijo.

"I understand, but this isn't your world. You belong there, its like with me but in the light world. You can have as much fun as you want here but you have to go back, don't you have friends to talk to?" said Jomi.

"I... do. But they don't need me. They do fine on their own, i wanna stay here. Even if that means forever locking the lithium room." said Mijo.

"I... can't let you do that, I'm.. you and you are me, you know this isn't right." said Jomi.

"Well, then I will just have to go out myself." said Mijo before drawing his sword.

"Look, i don't wanna fight but if you want to... i can." said Jomi before drawing her sword.

"OK OK LETS DO THIS!!!" said Mijo before attacking.

They fought but eventually Jomi was defeated with a surprise scabbard to the stomach.

"Hah... That was fun. But I have to go, to new areas. Good luck! I know you'll survive, and I'll meet you again!" said Mijo, before walking away, towards the gate that leads to the grass outside.

"Jomi!" shouted Ikari, from the fountain room.

"Are you fine? Are you ok?" said Ikari, worried.

"I'm fine, i have healing powers. Just go after him, before he does something rash." said Jomi pointing to her hand with a green glow.

"UH, are you sure I can take him, I mean you got defeated right here!" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I don't know. Find. Out. I can't really get you out of here without him, so... Good Luck?"
said Jomi, clearly having her fingers crossed.

"Uh, sige, mamatay naman din ako anyway, uh sasama ka ba?" said Ikari.

"Soon. I guess you can fight hanggang makapunta ako." said Jomi.

"Ok... See ya'!" said Ikari before going to the same door that Mijo went.

<!--Attempt at Fight Scene-->
<p id="R4"><md-block># Random DR Fight</md-block></p>

One day, in the Playas Cemetery....

"I... don't know what to say, honestly.." said Mijo.

"Yeah, guess so, but you can get the advice of our dead family over here." said Jomi.

"What? But I have my parents right there!" said Mijo, pointing to his parents.

"Can they even see me?" said Jomi.

"Oh definitely, I just said that you were a friend in school that also went here." said Mijo.

"Right, and they won't notice the... similarities?" said Jomi.

"Think so, i'll just say it's a coincidence, and besides, no one will look that far unless they're my friends..." said Mijo.

"Ok... and they won't notice how I have no parents or where they even are???" said Jomi.

"Relax... We're here to talk about life and.. Her. Don't worry, I gooot this. If I need help, I'll ask you, ok?" said Mijo.

"Alright, alright, I don't trust you, but you are the only one that can do anything about that, anyways, so-" said Jomi,

Before a large dark fountain opened right in the center of the cemetery, Mijo and Jomi quickly rushed to see what was happening, but got sucked into the dark world before seeing the fountain opener. They landed at the part where the fountain was, but it was basically the cemetery but dark, so off they go exploring again.

"Ah shit, didn't got time to-" said Mijo.

"Ok, relax Mijo, it's just a dark world, the only thing we need to do is quickly close it, so nothing significant happens." said Jomi.

"Good point, but if the fountain isn't here then..." said Mijo, thinking then he said, "Maybe..." before getting cut off by Jomi.

"Oh, its right there!" Jomi points to the fountain near where they were just talking in the light world.

"Sweet, it's one of those easy ones." said Mijo.

They quickly rushed to the fountain and as Mijo was closing it, someone blasted Mijo away from the fountain.

"Oof, sino ka!" said Mijo as he gets up.

"Hahaha... What's up!" said someone.

"Wait, you are... Cajo!" said Jomi.

"Who the fuck is Cajo?" said Mijo.

"Let me introduce myself, so you know how those dark fountains open without you? That's me!" said Cajo.

"What? No, that was Doctor G and Cara right?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, and I work with them, I opened those, not them." said Cajo.

"Ok... Who are you, lightner? darkner? Just who are you exactly?" said Mijo.

"Oh, uh... I come from nowhere!" said Cajo.

"Really, you can't even say where you even come from?" said Jomi.

"WHAT? Do you know me?" said Cajo.

"Well actually yes, you are Cajo, the lightner that was dissatisfied... I guess you got broken out by those two..." said Jomi.

"Oh, OH! YOU... You. Ikaw ah... Papatayin ko kita ngayon!!" said Cajo.

"Nope, not on my watch." said Mijo.

"Ok, Mijo. LET'S DANCE!" said Cajo.

<!--FEB 29 SPINOFF FUN SHORT LORE BREAK-->
<p id="R5"><md-block># DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark</md-block></p>

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after S1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!

<!--IDEA 16 made into an actual spinoff-->
<p id="R6"><md-block># DeltaRambles: It's Magic Time</md-block></p>

## Summary: 

When there's an important event to go to, especially where his friends are, Mijo tries magic but things go unexpected and he still has to go to the event.

## Author's Note: 

This _definitely_ doesn't say anything about me, it's just a fun idea turned into an actual story that I did because it would be fun to see this happen, might be canon, but you'll see.. anyways enjoy!

Edit 1: It has implicit sexual things, since I don't want to write one but it is the natural progression of things, so keep that in mind!

————————————————————————————

On the day before student's night, at Jomi's library, where Mijo was sifting through some books.

"Aha! I knew it! It exists!" said Mijo before Jomi surprises him.

"What exists?" said Jomi as Mijo jumps in surprise.

"Wha— You're here?! Um, no, nothing, yeah.." said Mijo as he closed the book.

"Hmm, that book is for transfiguration.. What are you thinking..?" said Jomi, as Mijo tries to return the books quietly.

"Uhh— nothing that _you_ are thinking of! Um, I'll be going to the.. training ground! Yep. Just—" said Mijo before Jomi stops him.

"Be honest, the student night is tomorrow and you are searching for magic that can modify your looks. Right?" said Jomi, as Mijo embarrassed, nodded.

"Alright, look, Don't try to hide anything from me, because.. I know you, you keep forgetting that—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah... I am not stupid, I just.. wanted to do this by myself you know? Like it's a surprise!"

"And? You can't just go to me and teach you, even though I'll make fun of you, I'll still help you, you know?" said Jomi, as Mijo took the book about transfiguration back from the bookshelf.

"Ok. But, you're always busy! Like, I just don't wanna disturb you in any of your work, like I would do in your situation." said Mijo, now finding that specific page.

"Hmm, you know too that I would help anyways, right? But, anyway... Since it's a special day tomorrow anyway here in the dark world too, I put some of the workload to my subjects. I still did my work, I am just on my break now, and went to see you." said Jomi as Mijo agrees and shows her the page.

"This, this one specifically. I wanna make a special form I can use and hide anytime." said Mijo, as Jomi carefully inspects the page.

"Transfiguration #4.1"
As with this magic, you can use transfiguration to turn yourself into anything you can imagine and design, current testing shows you can only modify yourself, and while lookalikes are possible, you cannot maintain them for long, as you have to use your own magic, and if it is far from your own look, it will also be more. An exception is for the different versions of yourself that you automatically have based on your genetics (**sex**, height, eye and hair colour; etc)...

"Oh, did you highlight the one with.. sex? Hey, hold on.. Oh no, I know what you're going to do.." said Jomi as Mijo is now awkwardly smiling.

"Yep... I also want to modify my clothing so that it can turn into a dress that I can wear, ya know for more effort?" said Mijo, as Jomi is genuinely thinking about the whole logistics.

"Uh.. sure. Let's go to my lab." said Jomi, before Mijo said, "Wait you have a lab?!" 

"Yeah. What? Where do you think I get my potions and random stuff I give? Stealing? Well, I refine stuff there.. Anyways let's go there." said Jomi, before they walked to the lab behind Jomi's desk near her throne room.

"Huh, you have a separate desk and throne? That's weird." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and they kept going to her lab.

"Welcome, to my lab! Stay here, I think I have a potion for this..." said Jomi, as she went to her potion storage to find the transfiguration potion she needed.

"Uh sure. I am just gonna look then." said Mijo, as Jomi searched through her collection. She went up, middle, down, until she found a heart-shaped potion with an eagle-shaped gem decoration that had a blend of pink and red liquid.

"Alright, here. This should do the trick." said Jomi as she gave the potion to Mijo before Mijo accidentally spilled it on himself.

"AH! SORRY! Um, what's happening to me..?!" said Mijo, as the liquid was absorbed into his body and he turned into the female version of himself, a Jomi that was wearing full gear, with a dress for some reason.

"Ooooh, interesting... Um, sorry for.. um laughing.. Hahaha.." said Jomi, as she picked up one of her notebooks and wrote down what happened to Mijo.

"Heh? Wait! I thought that I was supposed to have a way to change it, and.. this looks permanent!" said Mijo, as he now looks upon his changed body.

"Hahaha.. This is why, you don't spill these types of potions.. Anywho, I still need to fix your mistake, soo wait.." said Jomi, as Mijo silently watches Jomi pick out a notebook she had that she started silently reading.

"Hmmm, hey can you do me a favor and go to the light world with this.. form? Umm, try to improvise i guess.." said Jomi, as she flips another page.

"Uh.. um.. you sure I can act like you?" said Mijo, as Jomi looked at Mijo and smiled and nodded.

"Uh ok.. Um do I have to go into the lab again afterwards?" said Mijo, as Jomi now puts the book back down.

"No... Just, go near my desk, I still have stuff to do.. So after I make this I'll just be at my desk." said Jomi, as she picked out a container.

"Um.. Ok. I am only doing this because I am also curious ok? I am going now.." said Mijo as Jomi laughed and nodded as she grabbed a gem-based design, with a narrow mouth and wide body.

"Uh.. Ahem.. I gotta be as fast as possible, huh.. no heels.. great! I am just gonna run as fast as I can.. _Hopefully_ nobody notices." said Mijo, as he ran with a dress that didn't interfere with his legs but still slowed him down due to his new form.

"Hey! Jomi!" called JR to an unsuspecting Mijo, now a lookalike of Jomi in anything but clothes.

"Uh.. Yes?" said Mijo, trying to sound like Jomi.

"Uh, do you know where Mijo is? I wanna talk with him about something.." said JR, looking like he has a lot to say.

"Ah— Him? He.. He's probably at the library.. Check there!" said Mijo, as he awkwardly stared at JR, waiting for his response.

"Hmm, ok! He always goes there whenever he's not at the training grounds.. Anyways, see ya!" said JR, as Mijo also said, "See ya!" to JR.

"Whew, Um.. That was unexpected so I gotta go, quick before anybody notices!" said Mijo as he traveled further down to the light world connector and got transported to the light world, seeing Rhida chilling near the entrance. Mijo now looks like a schoolgirl with a tie and dress, just like how a typical female student would of Honrato Pez.

"Oh, hi— Uh, who are you? Um wait—" said Rhida, as Mijo awkwardly waves at her and says, "Oh, ah— I am.. Jomi? Yeah.."

"You're Jomi? Wait, aren't you—" said Rhida before Mijo interrupted, "Yes, I am still the pink notebook, just um.. I have the special properties of being able to have this form while outside the dark world, yeah!"

"Oooh, you haven't told me that.. Interesting, so I can bring you with me tomorrow, or even later??" said Rhida, as Mijo tries hard to get out of the conversation.

"Um.. No, I still have important stuff to do in the dark world, I just.. wanted to test something, for more details, ask Mijo about it later!" said Mijo, as he tries desperately to go back to the dark world secretly.

"Oooh! Ok I am sure it's _very_ important so I'll leave you and Mijo to do it, remember our deal!"  said Rhida, as she continued browsing through her phone.

"Ah, thanks! I'll be going now!" said Mijo, as he finally went back, thinking what deal Jomi made and how Jomi and her were on good terms, even before she went to him, and after the incident during the previous cataclysm.

"Uh.. I'll ask Jomi later, anyways, it's pretty clear what happened, I have to go, now!" said Mijo, as he ran as fast as possible to Jomi's desk.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's desk*

Jomi was humming something as she managed her government papers, as JR entered her hall with a door connecting her lab, throne room and library.

"Woah! Jomi? I thought you were outside or something and, didn't you have like.. your battle gear on? Why do you _still_ have your... mayor suit?" said JR, as Jomi stops humming and looks at JR, surprised.

"Wha— Oh. Uh, right. Um, I just switched out of them, yeah. I am just sorting some documents now." said Jomi, surprised but understanding the situation.

"Uhuh, anyways is Mijo still behind this library? I still have something to say to him." said JR, as  Jomi nodded and JR proceeded to go in the library, closing the door behind him.

Then Mijo appeared, opening the door leading to the hall, and was heavily breathing, and shouted to Jomi, "Jomi! Jomi! We *need* to go into your lab, *now!"*

"Haha, lets be quick, JR is waiting behind that door..!" said Jomi, pointing to the library door before Mijo rushed into her lab, as Jomi follows closely and closes the door.

"Aight, you sure you want your old body back? You could just forego your old identity haha.." said Jomi sarcastically as she grabbed the potion from earlier that she made.

"Yes, of course! Wh— I mean, I still need to attend school and I can't exactly register you as a student so—" answered Mijo, before Jomi suddenlt gives him the potion. "Yeah, yeah I am joking, I wouldn't wanna know how that works, anyway.." said Jomi, before Mijo drank the potion and afterwards, put it in a nearby table. "This is a temporary fix, since developing the potion that instantly changes clothes and body, et cetera.. Takes more time, so what I am doing is using your current clothes, but you change form depending on.. your glasses!"

"Wha— My glasses..? So, like.. woah!" said Mijo before he suddenly changed form to his old self, with his usual dark world clothing. "So.. If I understand correctly, my.. other form is my actual body, and this is like a disguise for now?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "Yep, that means if you even separate yourself from your glasses, you'll turn to a girl! This is the price you pay for ruining my glass, now I'll actually have to steal from someone haha.."

"Don't! So, like.. How long does this.. potion take to make?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi cleans the potion and puts it back in the empty containers. "Hmm, I'll tell you when it's done, now get out, JR's waiting for you lol." answered Jomi, as she pushes Mijo out and closes the lab door. "Hey! You use lol IRL?! Bruh—" said Mijo to the lab door, as JR pats his back to get his attention.

"H—huh? Oh, hi..! I was just talking with Jomi about a book I found, what do you want..?" asked Mijo, as JR looks at him with disapproval before saying, "Uhuh.. Anyway, I have to talk to you about something.. Is she going out of that.. back room of hers?"

"Uh.. probably? Let's talk in the library then." said Mijo, just as they walked to the library and headed for a nearby seating.

"So, is there any reason why you haven't been out of the library for.. the entirety of the intramurals? Like, after that day, whenever I asked Jomi where were you, she said here, so I am simply curious.. What are you studying, maybe I can help..?" asked JR, as Mijo tries to hide his embarrassment at his words. "Oh.. yeah.. Sorry, just kinda busy, y'know.. Abyss Doctor stuff, so I have just been preparing.. I mean, I do go out, just not when you're around I guess.." answered Mijo, as he looks over at the part near the transfiguration book.

"Hmm..? Alright, yeah.. the abyss doctor.. I wonder when he'll come back... Well, that's... Hm... Sige, I'll leave you to it. Pag kailangan mo, we're here. Anyways, this new mushroom based attack, Imma see if I can do it.." said JR, as he stood up and left the library. "Good luck! *sigh* Now what.. I am basically a different person inside.. Ugh.. How does it even work..? Like, is it frozen in time or something.. or.. I don't even want to know.." mutterred Mijo to himself as he contemplated his life decisions.

"Hey! Mijo! Our daily sparring match? Did you forget?" asked Urda, as she entered the library. "O—oh! Yeah, lets go." responded Mijo, as he walked up to her and they walked to the training ground.

"Same as before, magic healthbar and no holding back, ok?" said Urda, as they prepared their weapons. "Alright, let's dance!" shouted Mijo, before they started their spar with Urda pressing a button to do so.

First, Mijo acted first slashing his way near Urda, before stunning her with his summoning slashes, as he follows it up with a slash up, so she gets knocked up, and as she is up, he quickly slashes her as he brings her down. Then he quickly teleports away, as before she could act, he managed to get a few more slashes in. Urda decides to use her gun to fire projectiles at Mijo, as he teleports and dodges all of them, as he gets the jump at Urda, quickly slashing her as Urda tries to block. Then he comes back and keeps putting pressure as she is unable to act as he keeps slashing and stabbing her. As he moves away, Urda decides to use her gun to blast in his general direction, he easily dodges and manages to keep bringing her healthbar down. Then as Urda decides to use wind to keep herself up and to block his shots, he decides to use his ultimate and break through space to deal a lot of damage. She falls down and Mijo deals a lot of damage to her as she is stunned by this amount of damage, by using his big sword and enhanced unarmed combat wear. Then as she finally has a chance to breathe, he uses his ultimate again, finishing the spar with him winning. 

"Haha.. you uh.. having a good day today.. I guess.. Whew.. And this close to student's night.." said Urda, as she sits down at the ground, exhausted. "Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I was that perfect, anyways.. What.. else..?" responded Mijo, as he also sits down, tired.

"I don't know, honestly.. Wanna get some food? Our spars just consume a lot of our energy.. so yeah." asked Urda, with a bit of hesitation. "Honestly, what time even is it.. I was so caught up with.. everything.. Just in general, abyss doctor stuff, my personal stuff, the school stuff, a lot.." said Mijo, not answering her question.

"Uh.. it's.. 2:30 PM in the light world.. What's on your mind, you can tell me... I won't judge!" said  Urda reassuringly, as she moves closer to him.
"Uh.. well, it's a secret, ok? I.. really am embarrassed about it.. I just don't wanna say _anything_ about it.." responded Mijo, as he tries to stay composed.

"Are you suuure..? I basically know most of your secrets, like Jomi.. Rhida.. you know what I mean." asked Urda, as she persistently bothers Mijo about it. " *sigh* Fiiine. Hold on, lemme stand up." said Mijo, acquiescing to her request. So he stood up, walked a few steps away from her and took off his glasses to reveal his actual form, with longer hair to the shoulder, a bigger chest area, and a more feminine body type, like Jomi's but with a bit more muscle.

"W—woah!! Are you actually Jomi?" questioned Urda, before Jomi appeared behind her, answering "Maybe..!", as she jumps up and sees the two, the only difference between them being how they style themselves. With Jomi, a more formal and royal purple look, while Mijo with his usual dark red and blue contrasting each other with a rough look.

"H—huh?! Two Jomis?!" questioned Urda, as Mijo wore his glasses again, turning him back to this 'old self'. "No.. Just a lil' magic that Mijo personally requested.. Anyways, I am going.. I just wanted to _check in..!_ " answered Jomi before she left, her steps being noticed by the other two.

"O—oh, whew.. Wait.. what magic?!" shouted Urda, before Jomi was far enough to not hear or see them. "Transformation Magic... That's what I've been busy with for a few days.. actually." answered Mijo, as Urda gasped at this answer. "No way..! So that's what you've been doing in the library! What's the reason..?" asked Urda, as Mijo comes closer to Urda.

"Just.. an experiment, that's all! I swear." said Mijo, as Urda chuckles. "Really..? Are you suure? Because I think there's a lot more to this than you say.." said Urda, teasing him again. "I am sure, alright.. one more round?" responded Mijo, standing up again.

"Haha.. Sure, but I want your girl form, deal?" said Urda, before Mijo reluctantly nodded and took off his glasses. "My glasses are for style points anyway, since getting this new form I have been able to see without it." responded Mijo, before he got his weapons ready.

"Coool, I should look into it, then." said Urda, as she started the spar, with health bars popping up.

They have a standoff as they look at each other intently for a while, before Mijo makes the first move, starting with his big slash using his big sword to slash as it gets deflected by Urda. Then he jumps high to the air and summons slashes against Urda as he does a big final slash, as he manages to get a small knock back as he lands. Suddenly Urda's blade clashed with Mijo's as he was knocked back and managed to backflip as he landed on his feet as he was knocked into the air and knocked back down with a combo from Urda. He then managed to switch to his other sword as he deflected a follow up attack and countered as he maintained his ground. Then they locked blades as they looked at each other intently before a quick deflect from Mijo due to a quick shot from Urda, pushed each other away. They both try to use their own ultimates as the two simultaneously attack each other and as it finishes, Mijo is noticeably lower in health. Urda tries to blast and maneuver Mijo as much as she can, as Mijo dodges, parries and counters her attack. Then Mijo attacks with a very risky move, moving to stab Urda straight at the heart as Urda brings down his health little by little, as he managed to get an opportunity and as she notices, she decides to counter and as the two stab each other in the chest, the game's over with Urda winning the duel.

Heavy breathing from both sides as both pull out their weapons. "Man, if we were just a little more risky, we could have damaged each other for real.." said Mijo, as he lay down on the floor. "Yeah.. Good game to you, but I managed to have enough health to tank that before you lost." responded Urda, as she also sits on the floor.

"Mhmm.. Well, what time is it? It's probably time to go home for today.." asked Mijo, as Urda responded, "Uhh oh, it's 3:30 PM, we should head back, it's a Thursday.. I don't know about you, but our sir is particularly strict, so I gotta go.. See you tomorrow!", as she waves Mijo goodbye as she walks back to enter the light world. He picks up his glasses and starts walking out of the training ground.

"I should head back too, a lot of prep is needed, and I am kinda tired too." muttered Mijo as he walked his way near the exit of the dark world. "Hey~" said Jomi, as she surprises Mijo again with a smile. "H—huh?! Oh, uh.. Jomi.. what do you want?" responded Mijo, as Jomi shows herself in front of him.

"Sooo what do you think..? Any.. complaints?" asked Jomi, as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah, are you done with the potion?"

"No.. I would've told you, anywho... I can see your hesitance and.. conflicted mind. So, I will say that you'll have an... interesting night ahead of you, don't worry.. I am working on it, just see me next week, ok?" responded Jomi, as Mijo sighs heavily and says, "Yeah, yeah.. I am.. just curious, does the.. change of clothes like earlier before the temporary potion, work now?"

"Should be the same, haha.. I can already tell in your eyes what you're thinking, all of it.. Try it, you'll have time to try before tomorrow, and... oh! Yeah, uh.. as for any side effects beside the obvious, this type of magic actually affects _those_ areas, but I'll need more time to figure out specifics, so hey! Why not try everything you've always wanted to try, maybe you'll learn something!" explained Jomi, before winking and gesturing Mijo to leave. "Ugh.. I sure do love and hate having someone like you around.. Anyway, then.. see you next week!" said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other.

As he goes out of the dark world and closes the portal for the next few days, he knows that he can't get there tomorrow and then the weekends too. He goes into their classroom and gets his bag as he sees his friends, Ikari already go out, and Lauvielle talking to somebody else. He then picks up his bag and leaves as his other classmates continue cleaning the room. He then checks the time, and it looks like it's 15:50, as he feels the breeze of the wind. He then looks at his phone, and stares at the home screen, knowing if he presses anything he won't ever get out of the internet spiral. Then his thoughts move on to his notes app, maybe he should start a diary of this, or maybe he should continue that memoir disguised as fantasy fiction of his adventures, but as he thinks of this, a certain JR comes up to him, as he exits the classroom.

"Hey. I have a question, is there going to be a chance to open and close the dark world during the morning, before the preparations for students night eventually take over?" asked JR, as Mijo is snapped out of his thoughts and looks at JR and answers, "Maybe.. I'll try to be early tomorrow, but you know me.. Since I largely don't care about the morning 'year-end party', I can maybe sneak it in before it officially starts.. Urda's probably busy with her class, but she might come up.. we'll see."

"Ok. Goodbye. See you tomorrow!" said JR, as he waved goodbye, going out of Mijo's vision by turning a corner. "Oh, right.. I might not care about the morning, but the night.. People say that.. to enjoy this once-a-year event in school, since you only ever get 6 times before it isn't the same anymore, but.. I.. really have well, no one else to _enjoy_ the night, my friends have their own dance, and the others might either leave or hangout with the others, since they're more.. confident?" muttered Mijo to himself, as he leans on a railing overlooking the school near his room.

"This new body too, Jomi's always vague with her words, but.. can't blame her honestly.. It's something I would do if I saw someone go through my situation. Anyways, times like these.. I always think about it, but.. there's just..  little things that I actually change. Huh.. Time often is wasted away by me, but.. I guess this is technically just waiting for my dad to pick me up, but what I could be doing during that time.. It's so much more than.. now. I think my often self-reflections are good, but then I should do something about it, it gets worse since I don't even share this, at least.. not willingly..." said Mijo to himself, as behind him his classmates finish cleaning, lock the classroom and leave.

"Oh, I should go down, and.. *sigh* Rhida's gone.. Welp, my chance with her is gone, anyways.. anything I want to do isn't until I go home, so imma just play some mobile videogames, like.. oooh! A companion game to Shingen Inpakuto, Honkstar Railway!" said Mijo, as he walked down the stairs as he went to a nearby unofficial waiting area that was just a student hangout place that was coincidentally close to the school gate.

He eventually decided to go and walk home. As he settles down in his bed, as he does the usual change to home clothes. Then he goes to his room that had his computer setup, since his house was built with separate shared bedrooms and other rooms used for work or school-related stuff.

"Whew.. Finally home and I can.. experiment. Hopefully they don't notice, or don't just enter my room without noise, I don't really wanna lock it since I'll have to explain why, and.. hopefully I can get this done and then, rest and watch some videos, play some games, et cetera.." muttered Mijo to himself as he enters another room that's used for extra bed space and storage for other people.

"Ok, first.. The obvious first thing that any person would do if they switched bodies is check.. this." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and then his pajamas. "Uh.. well, I guess I should.." said Mijo, as he took off his shirt.

Meanwhile in the living room, May and June, his parents are talking about work stuff. 

"Then, this girl was complaining about the foods that the campaign manager gave her since the other side had larger portions, while I was just listening intently trying to be discreet in eavesdropping, afterwards we talked about it, it's just another crazy day of government office volunteering.." ranted May, as June remarks, "Yeah, that's just how people are. It's fine, they probably just got irritated by something else.. I don't want to say what that could be, since it could be anything anyway."

"Oh yeah, food's ready. Call our son." said May, before June walks to where Mijo is. 

As Mijo looks at his body, he gets the urge to see what would happen if he touched it.

"Should I..? Should I? I.. don't think there's anything else to do, I can look at the fit of different clothes later. Uh.. oh no.. that's likely dad... I should immediately dress up and confront him, it's likely dinner time.." said Mijo to himself as he quickly dressed back up, hearing his dad walk to his room. Then he sees his dad and greets him, so they can eat dinner.

Then they eat dinner, as he half-heartedly listens to his parents conversation and after a while he finishes his food. He heads off to his room again afterwards and lays down on the floor while listening to a random long video in his recommendation. 

"Ugh... I really should've just went and talked to someone after closing the dark world.. At least then, I'll have something to look forward to, aside from the food and drinks.. of course." said Mijo as he stared at the ceiling. "I could just play videogames, but Urda isn't online.. Neither is Lauvielle nor Ikari.. Hmm.. I should probably figure out what to do, but.. wait!" muttered Mijo, as he jumped up and stood on his feet.

"The experiment hasn't finished yet! Let's head to the other room again." said Mijo to himself as he walked to the other room and closed the door, making sure to lock it, since he shouldn't be expecting anyone. Then he stripped himself again, taking off his clothes and glasses.

"Ok, alright. Uh.. sooo, i mean.. what else is there to do? It doesn't have the same effect as if I either changed form fully or Jomi manages to go out of the dark world, since relatively a few things change, besides inside me but that's easy.. to hide! Anyway, I should just get on with it, since Jomi likely expects me to do this, and.. this is one of the few times that magic is brought to the light world. So, here goes nothing!" said Mijo, as he starts touching himself in the changes around the chest and crotch areas.

"Huh, that's weird. This.. _aroused_ feeling, it's weird. Is it because of my brain, or is it the magic..? I am going to.. lay down on the bed." said Mijo, as he lay down on the bed pushing away his clothes. "Ugh.. Mmm.. I'm going to stop, I've promised myself to not go too far with this, I.. think it's enough. My.. breathing is noticeably faster and so is my heartbeat.. I.. I am gonna pass out." said Mijo, as he unexpectedly closed his eyes due to mixed euphoria and dizziness that he felt. After an hour or two, a knock is heard at the door as May calls on Mijo, "Mijo! Mijo! Your clothes for tomorrow! Try it out!"

"H—huh..? Oh shi.. Right, the students night! Oh no—" said Mijo as he quickly dresses up and gets his glasses, transforming himself back. "Yeah! Coming! Wait a sec!" shouted Mijo back, as May responded, "Ok! I'll be waiting in the living room!"

"Whew.. Uh.. What happened..? One moment, I was just.. exploring and.. uh.. y—you know what, I am just going to ignore that and quickly go to where she is." said Mijo, before he opened the door, grabbed his phone and left to go to the living room.

"So here's the clothes for the year-end party in the morning, then we switch it out with this one for students night in the afternoon until midnight. Try it out!" said May, as she gestured to Mijo to try the first one. Then Mijo tried the first one as he put down his phone nearby, then went to go behind a big dresser cabinet to change as May looked at her phone, waiting for him.

"Oh no.. If she ever gets curious or wants to see me while I don't expect she could see.. welp, no point in dwelling. I just hope I get lucky." said Mijo as he tries his best to quickly change and then he reveals himself, his clothes being specifically picked out due to a theme of dark academia that the officers of his class decided, with a landslide vote for it due to the other themes not being serious.

"Oh wow, look how handsome you are in that style! What do _you_ think of it?" remarked May, as Mijo responds, "Yeah, it's fine i guess. It fits the theme for sure. Imma go try the other one." as he grabs the second one and goes behind the dresser again, and quickly changes to the second style, a dark blue polo with a large coat. Then he reveals this to his mom.

"Wow, even better.. It was a good decision to reuse those school pants since your polo is also dark blue, the coat looks nice but it might be too hot before night." said May, as Mijo nodded and asked, "Is.. that all, including the rice for tomorrow's school day event?"

"Yeah, change back, and I am going to prepare each of them for tomorrow, have fun tomorrow anak!" said May, as Mijo went and changed back and left to go back to his room after grabbing his phone again. "Whew.. Ok, that's done. Now, where were we.. Oh right, the whole.. experiment. What time even is it?" said Mijo, as he checks the time and sees it is 20:30, it is usually when he and Urda played games, but when he checked her profile, she was offline and most likely accidentally fell asleep again.

"Oh, well. Let's go back to experimenting, I better not lose my mind again." said Mijo, as he put down his phone and headed off to the other room. Then he closed the door, locking it again, then undressed again, taking off his clothes and glasses. "Ok, so.. uh.. I am just gonna continue and stop when it affects me, because.. whatever happened earlier, the memories are far too dizzy to be a success in exploring." said Mijo, before he touched himself in the chest and crotch areas again, then after some short somewhat unintentionally sensual touches, he laid down in the bed again, trying to process and stay conscious, with the same effect as before, heavy breathing, faster heartbeat, and subconscious moving on his hips and legs.

"Wha— What..? Why.. Is this... I.. ugh.. I am going to.. mmm.. just try to stay still, and.. yeah.." said Mijo, as he tried to stay conscious and experience the euphoria of pleasure as well as the overwhelming sense of dizziness from the sudden experience. "Whew.. Come on, stay determined.. Don't lose focus.. just like before.. ahh.. uh.. ok, i am gonna, ah!" said Mijo as he tries to move his body accidentally touching his other parts, stopping him from continuing to move.

"I.. don't think this is normal.. While it.. has some similarities from what I've read.. this is way too.. extreme. What was.. in those two potions? I guess... this is... somewhat brand new.. at least, inferring from Jomi's vague wording..." said Mijo as he stayed still, attempting to wait out the sensation. He waits for a while, but the feeling never goes away, although it is less intense than before.

"Hah.. I can't keep this up, while.. it's so.. intoxicating.. I can't keep this for long.. Wait.. I have to write it down.. My phone..!" said Mijo, as he attempts to go out of bed and get to his phone, as he unlocks the door.

"Just... have to.. get this.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he grabbed his phone and walked quickly as fast as he could, with being dizzy and not having clothes on, and locked his door again, then he stumbles back to his bed, beginning to close his eyes. "No.. I.. have to, go to my notes app, and.. ugh.. No.. video?" said Mijo, as he looked at his phone and focused on the notes then the camera app.

"Ok, record.. Listen, Mijo.. Don't save this video nor should you let anyone but yourself see this, you've made this phone for yourself so.. anything that you see, write it down please.. Now.. no.. uh.. my.. storage.." said Mijo as he closed his eyes and fell unconscious, as the camera continued recording. Then after 2 hours, he finally wakes up in a daze.

"Huh.. Hah? Hah! What? I am still in this form.. and my phone? Oh no, my storage.. It's been recording for two hours, let's see what it recorded." said Mijo, as he stopped the recording and looked at the video, it replayed the first part, the whole message then after losing consciousness, after two minutes, he suddenly sees himself move his hands to the crotch and chest area and moan a bit before he paused and turned the screen off. "N—no... We are not watching me.. doing that for 2 hours. But.. ugh.. is that even me? Is.. Is that me? Is that what I did.. But.. why don't I remember this..? Like.. it's all hazy and dizzy, vaguely pleasurable but.. *sigh* I don't know.. and.. it's 23:30 too.. It's almost time to sleep so I can be early tomorrow..", as he lays down on the bed.

"I.. should check my.. huh?" said Mijo, as he looks into his notifications and sees messages from Urda 1 hour ago. 

Urda: Hey bro wanna play some Shingen Inpakuto? 
Let's do that new character's story quest like that girl with a gun that is a guard?
Oh you might be busy that's fine! I'll save it for saturday then, I'm just going to play in our Digmake Server! You'll have a surprise ;)

"Digmake? Like... the server we paid for 500 pesos? Huh.. It's a sandbox survival game, I wonder what she's trying to do.. blow up my house with TNT? Or replace it with a dirt house? Oh well. It was an hour ago, she must be still there.. But, I still have to continue my Shingen dailies!" said Mijo, as he went out of his bed and dressed up as he got his glasses and he transformed back. "Then let's get my phone and play some Shingen, then hop on the server!" muttered Mijo, as he grabbed his phone then went out of the room as he closed the door.

He went to his computer and started playing videogames, enjoying his time in Shingen and Digmake as he kept his phone charged and off. After a while, he eventually stopped playing and said goodbye to Urda as they logged off the night. He checked the time, and it was 0:30, an hour after the second experiment. He decides it was probably time to sleep and does the routine of cleaning and closing the room for the night before he heads off to his bed. As he does some chores before he heads off to bed, he listens to some videos as he tries to put the events before in the back of his mind, as it brings up memories that he prefers not to think of for now. 

Then he heads off to bed and sleeps, trying to move on and hopefully have a normal day tomorrow, although he sleeps without his glasses and he also grabs a long blanket to hopefully conceal any noticeable changes from his mother since she sleeps near him on another bed in the same room. As he sleeps, he begins to dream about the special events vaguely happening as it distorts to Jomi noticing and watching. In his dream, it is distorted to have more sensual and pleasure than what actually happened as he begins to imagine Jomi observing then ignoring him. Then after 6 hours, he wakes up with a phone alarm playing, as he turns it off with a morning look.

"Agh.. Welp, I guess it's time. I better get my glasses and—" said Mijo, as someone is heard closing on him. "Not this time!" muttered Mijo to himself as he wears his glasses and transforms back. His father arrives and leaves due to seeing him clearly awake so he got out of bed, grabbed his phone and headed off to eat. He eats and then he goes off to shower, not forgetting to transform once inside the shower since it is hidden from anyone else, he notices the changes to how he showers due to the transformation, but he keeps focused at his routine. After showering, he grabs his towel and wears his glasses as he heads off to another room and dresses up as he watches his surroundings making sure no one sees him until he's done. Then he went to the living room to grab his shoes and school I.D.

"I'm just going to clean this.." said June, as he takes the glasses of Mijo to properly clean it with anti-fogging liquid with a large microfiber cloth. He noticed this immediately but he didn't want to draw attention as his chest was getting heavier on his clothes. He continued putting on his shoes as his father finished cleaning and put it down on the table as Mijo grabbed it before June looked at him again, as he transformed back. He then left to go and prepare their vehicle as Mijo put his phone in his sling bag, grabbed his things, looked himself in the mirror then promptly grabbed his face mask then left as May went out of the room to grab something as she noticed Mijo leave. "Bye anak!" said May, as they both wave goodbye to each other.

Then he went to his dad, so they drove to school. As this happens, Mijo is checking on his phone for messages in the classroom GC about the party, then he looks at the rice container that his classmates asked him to bring. Then he checks the other GC to see Urda telling him that she barely managed to get the time to open the dark world before being dragged into her classroom for the class by class party. Then he was dropped off at school as they waved goodbye to each other and he went into school. He brought his rice container on the way, walking up stairs, into their classroom before sneakily going out and jumping in the dark world nearby. He lands to find no one nearby.

"W—wait.. Where is everybody..? Jomi usually meets me here.. Hmm, though she could be just in her castle but.. then where's the bustling atmosphere..?" remarked Mijo, as he walked to Jomi's castle. He then noticed some guards at the entrance as he was stopped by them. "Her Majesty Jomi isn't allowing any lightners nor any of us to enter the castle!" said one of the guards.

"Then where's the others? Where's Jomi?" questioned Mijo, as the guards looked at each other and gave Mijo a piece of paper with Jomi's handwriting.

Hey, If you see this, this means that I have left the castle with some guards to deal with some abyss threats. I am currently writing this in the downtime, but as for now, there was a sudden surge of abyss attacks that just happened, and so I've been focusing my efforts there, sorry if I couldn't be there and I promise I'll be there next time, until then.. follow my orders and leave for now. The other people have either joined me or have joined the other guards in protecting and making shelter. The timeframe is this day, that includes your students night, so good luck there and have fun! 

— signed by Jomi (The Princess~)

"O—oh.. I see.. I'll have to inform the others, have you seen any other lightner?" asked Mijo, as the other guard answered, "We saw Miss Urda enter first and then Sir JR entered before they went to us, we explained the situation then they left."

"I see. I'll go now. Good luck soldiers." said Mijo, as the other guards saluted as he left and returned to the light world. He went out and closed the dark world as JR was waiting for him outside their classroom.

"Hey, you closed the dark world, right?" asked JR, as Mijo nodded and leaned into the wall nearby him. "Well, Jomi said something about the abyss threats, and you said you've been researching about the abyss and the abyss doctor. Soo, any information you can.. share?" asked JR, as Mijo thought about it and answered, "Uh.. Well, I've also been reading about him and have been talking with Jomi a lot, however this one was unexpected, not even we expected it, so I am just waiting until next week or later to see what happens."

"I see, I was also wondering but couldn't ask anyone knowledgeable enough, such as you, or Jomi. Hmm.. Wouldn't this dark world crisis affect the party today?" asked JR, as Mijo answered, "I think so, but I don't know when it will erupt so I guess we have to stay vigilant."

"Welp, I guess we just enjoy until battle is necessary then, are you.. coming in the classroom?" questioned JR, as Mijo smiles and responds, "Just tell them that I am sick or something, I.. got a disguise..!" as he reveals his transformation by taking off his glasses.

"Oh! oh? Magic works in the light world?" questioned JR, as Mijo showed off and answered, "Think so, you'll have to ask Jomi—" as they both say, "But she is busy!"

"Yeah! She is. Anyways, what do you think?" asked Mijo as JR inspects Mijo, "You look like Jomi in a suit honestly." remarks JR, as Mijo nodded and said, "That's true. Anyways are you going in? It looks like it's starting."

"Yeah, uh good luck I guess." said JR, as he went inside and a couple of others started to call on the class. He transformed back to his other form, and chilled outside of the classroom, as he scrolled on his phone. He messages the GC saying that the dark world was closed due to abyss threats and that they should stay vigilant but be informed. He goes back to scrolling his phone.

After a lot of doing nothing, he decides to transform and check out the school, making sure to watch out for other people. There were surveillance cameras, but to the cameras it looked like there was just a student that was walking around, and there could be many reasons why so he also thought of reasons if he ever gets questioned. He is particularly going to a demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it.

"Hey, uhh where _is_ Mijo? Doesn't the message in the GC say that the dark world was closed? Then where is he?!" questioned Ikari, as she sits in a chair in the classroom, as she's talking to Lauvielle. "I don't know.. I was going to ask JR, but he seems busy.." responded Lauvielle, as JR is talking to someone else about something. "And you two have.." said Ikari, before Lauvielle said, "Yeah.. we uh.. have somewhat of a falling out due to our research project having some issues, you get it, Mijo talked about it in our 3-person GC."

"Oh look, he seems to be finished. I'll go ask, he sees me less.. negatively. Than you at least." said Ikari, ss Lauvielle nodded and watched Ikari go towards JR. "Yeah, the zoo party game was a total mess. I don't wanna know what they thought would happen when a bunch of highschoolers scream at each other to find their 'group'." said JR, as Ikari overhears this and says to JR, "Hey JR, I have a question."

"Oh? Yeah, what is it?" asked JR before Ikari answers, "Where is.. Mijo? He uh.. told us about.." she looks around and continues, "the dark, yeah. And I was wondering if.. no, where he is?"

"Oh. Hm." responds JR as he also looked around, before answering, "He's.. hmm, check the GC. I'll post there."

"Oh, ok. I'll await it then." said Ikari, as she goes back near Lauvielle. "Oh? My phone? Ah ok.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari nudges her to check her phone. They go to the gc to see JR typing until a message appeared:

JR: As for @Mijo's whereabouts, he told me to tell you guys he's sick but we know that's codeword for he's not going to attend class for a reason, likely the reason why the dark world was closed, staytuned he might need us

"Oh, so he's like on a quest again, like what Urda told us Jomi is on... They really are.." said Lauvielle, before Ikari interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I get it. Hmm, I'm kinda bored.. Why don't we help Mijo? Let's say we want to go the CR, I am sure they won't care."

"Uh... ok. Tara." said Lauvielle as the two excused themselves from the classroom party and headed outside. "Easy. Let's.. huh, who is that?" questioned Ikari, as she looks over to a girl who is headed to the ruins of a demolished building. 

Meanwhile, Mijo has entered the ruins of the demolished area, as he uses his transformation to avoid anyone recognizing him. He was particularly interested how spacious it was and how it was ignored and there has been no effort to close it off. "Huh, this is interesting.. You know, if there was a boss fight here, it would have the space! But.. I am sure nothing bad will happen.. please?" said Mijo to himself, as he heard a loud thud behind his back. "Aw man.." said Mijo, as he turned around to see a dark abyss figure materialize in front of him. "And.. Where's my weapons? Uh, oh no." said Mijo, as he tried to summon his weapons with no response. "You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "Oh no, uh.. stick? That will do." said Mijo, as he grabbed a long wooden stick to protect himself. The dark figure immediately sprung to slash him, easily breaking his stick and forcing him back. "I am soo fucked." said Mijo as he looked at the dark figure walking at him intimidatingly. "Welp, I guess it was good while it lasted.." said Mijo, as the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground, as the other two watched at the sidelines.

"T—that abyss monster just killed her! W—we have to get everyone here!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari got her phone to quickly call the others. "Wait.. where's Mijo then? He's supposed to handle stuff like this.." asked Ikari, as they both frantically call their GC. "If he was here, he wouldn't be able to do anything?! We don't have our own magic, so he doesn't but.. how did they appear?!" responded Lauvielle, as the dark figure looked at them menacingly. 

"Ah! Let's run!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari already started running as soon as the dark figure looked. "H—hey! Wait up!" shouted Lauvielle as she ran to Ikari's position.

Meanwhile, Mijo wakes up at an unknown dark space with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center. "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and to the ground, then he falls to the ground. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword and summoned the hilt as through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up..." said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two help Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "Y—yeah! Uh, JR told us you used transformation magic so we know that form, a—and.. we called as much backup as possible. I know you probably went here with the intention of not getting us involved, but.." explained Lauvielle before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others try to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summons a sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and kills the dark figure, making it dissapear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others look at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?" said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they waved goodbye to Mijo.
