    # U DeltaRambles: Love and War

    Summary: Leviente and Lauvielle gets together! But issues happen!

Author's Notes: This was based on some personal experience / irl shit that i turned into a story

Before the dark worlds, there was a story... A story about love. . and WAR..  

First, began on grade 8-Clam, with Leviente and Lauvielle first meeting each other.

Leviente met Mijo and they became best friends instantly but another relationship was brewing as he met a certain person from the other seat, Lauvielle...

Leviente said, "Hello! So about the project..." 

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, yeah! Gawin na natin!"

Lauvielle and Leviente then developed friendship from there but as they met each other, they just couldn't stop looking and hanging out with them.

Lauvielle, at home, speaking to herself at home,  "Ughh, di ko maalis sa isip ko ang lalaki niyon... Probably wala lang.. I mean, magkaibigan kami diba so ok lang ito.."

Meanwhile, at home, Leviente speaking to himself at home, "Hmmm, yung babae niyon, we click together so much... Yeah, but i think that's just friends behavior right? Yeah.."

So, as months pass by... Their friends become wary of their "special" friendship...

Lauvielle said, "So, that's how i convinced my mother to give her old aPhone to me!"

Jura said, "Ok then.. about Leviente."

Danola said, "Yeah.. nakikita namin na nagkakasama ka ng sobra kay Leviente..."

Lauvielle said, "What??? Di kaya! Ano lang kami um enemies, magkalaban and yung sinabi ni sun tzu na keep enemies closer something like that."

They went into the classroom and saw Mijo and Leviente talking:

Mijo said, "Soo yeah that's pretty much it, like that quiz was soo hard!"

Leviente laughed in agreement and said, "Yeah, ganon lang talaga Mijo! Di ko din alam na-"

Lauvielle said, "Hi!! Leviente! (and Mijo) So you people wanna talk about something?"

Mijo said, "Yeah! So like life? How do you cope with it??"

Leviente said, "Well, i study first, and a lot then naglalaro ako... Ikaw Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle said, "Uhhh, well same naman haha!"

Danola and Jura joined in after separately putting away their things in their bags and Jura continued, "Well, sino mga crushes niyo?"

Danola first said, "Not anyone here, pero someone else sa school..."

Jura then said, "I don't really have anyone though, except you and Lauvielle" looking to Danola.

*Silence* 

Jura said, "Well??? Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Well, no, not anyone... Not anymore.. Uh Leviente?"

Leviente said, "I.. don't have anyone right now?"

Lauvielle quickly blurted out, "Uhh no? Yea.. wala din!"

Jura said, "Hmmm really? Ok... Lauviente!"

Both Lauvielle and Leviente quickly responded, "What?? No non, kaibigan lang kami at magkaway kasi yung..." 

Leviente said, "...lola nito na may Alzheimer's-" 

Lauvielle said, "...tao nito na parang unggoy-"

Then a teacher arrived and the conversation stopped...

But after a while, their facade started to slip, as they were grouped with each other, were also being called out by their friend group as clearly in love and they spent a lot of time alone together but one day during a party at the school...

Jura and Danola are enjoying the party as Lauvielle as well but something was always bothering her, where Leviente is and can she talk to him but then Jura and Danola came up and started talking to her:

Jura said, "Heyy Lauvielle, you should start talking to Leviente, kakadating lang niya at naguusap kasama nila Mijo and 'The Boys'."

Danola said, "Yeah, you should, we noticed that uh you are not quite enjoying the party and alam natin kung bakit kaya just settle it at puntahan mo siya

Lauvielle said, "Ok ok.. fiine... But di ko siya talaga gusto ah!"

So she goes up to Leviente and starts talking:

"Sooo, uhh meron akong talagang importante at sikretong sasabihin sa'yo!"

Leviente responded, "Uhh sure! Saan?"

Lauvielle said, "Kung saan! Pero di dito sa classroom."

The 'Boys' which include Domez collectively encourage Leviente along with Mijo who has also joined in.

Leviente said, "Let's go then."

So they went outside and looked for a place and found one! At the tables and chairs near the former exit gate.

Leviente and Lauvielle then sat down and started talking to each other:

# DeltaRambles: HellFire

Summary: 

Author's Note: A student kills every darkner in the dark world lol. Also no relation to Canon Mijo btw.

Mijo wakes up after falling into a dark world in the classroom, he sees his student uniform worn down, and only a revolver with around enough ammo to survive for a day or so. 

Mijo said, "Ah shit, I'm screwed. I only have a revolver, at yun lang. Sana makakita ako ng ibang tao..."

So he got up and walked.. At first the darkness was... calming but soon it turned into dread as sound everywhere of something. Then he saw a huge field, filled with computer setups that have cabinets. 

He jumped down there and immediately a monster started attacking him and so he shot it but the monster relented. Mijo was knocked and hit a bunch of the setups, he kept shooting at the monster, but he was eventually knocked down and was about to die until...

Jamise shouted, "Hey! Get away from my Friend!!!" before shooting the monster and the monster decided to chase her instead.

Mijo was so hurt that he began to drift away to unconsciousness until a certain voice called out to him.

Urda said, "Yo, don't die on me Mijo, aalis tayo dito kasama ang lahat, yun yung sinabi ni Jamise sakin.." then she healed him. 

Barely enough that Mijo can walk because her magic was exhausted as well.

Mijo said, "Thanks. Jamise would do that huh, well we should go. Gusto ko din umalis bro.."

So Mijo got up and walked with Urda towards Jamise where she was fighting with the monster.

Jamise shouted, "Mamatay ka!! Putang inang halimaw!" before shooting the monster until it was dead.

# Alt DR S2 C2D Mijo
'Hey,

"I am staying here. You don't have a clue on
how the Light World works." said Mijo.

"I'm just saying, you can survive the light world right?" said Jomi.

"No. The Light world sucks, it just is." said Mijo.

"Mijo, I'm concerned with what you are thinking about here, isn't the light world fun too?" said Jomi.

"You know, why I'm here, but incase you haven't thought much about it, I AM DONE WITH LIFE ON THE LIGHT WORLD. SCHOOL, hurts. The STRESS AND PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW- I WANNA ENJOY the world here." said Mijo.

"But Mijo, please, just let her go by closing the portal." said Jomi.

"No, NO! She can go off on her own, that's fine, you CAN teach her right? Just let her go then. I will be staying here. For the future." said Mijo.

"Well, Mijo, it will be unfavorable to both of you, if you guys get separated in the worlds, trust me." said Jomi.

"I Guess, but I dont wanna go back out there, where problems are way harder, just staying here is good enough for me." said Mijo.

"I understand, but this isn't your world. You belong there, its like with me but in the light world. You can have as much fun as you want here but you have to go back, don't you have friends to talk to?" said Jomi.

"I... do. But they don't need me. They do fine on their own, i wanna stay here. Even if that means forever locking the lithium room." said Mijo.

"I... can't let you do that, I'm.. you and you are me, you know this isn't right." said Jomi.

"Well, then I will just have to go out myself." said Mijo before drawing his sword.

"Look, i don't wanna fight but if you want to... i can." said Jomi before drawing her sword.

"OK OK LETS DO THIS!!!" said Mijo before attacking.

They fought but eventually Jomi was defeated with a surprise scabbard to the stomach.

"Hah... That was fun. But I have to go, to new areas. Good luck! I know you'll survive, and I'll meet you again!" said Mijo, before walking away, towards the gate that leads to the grass outside.

"Jomi!" shouted Ikari, from the fountain room.

"Are you fine? Are you ok?" said Ikari, worried.

"I'm fine, i have healing powers. Just go after him, before he does something rash." said Jomi pointing to her hand with a green glow.

"UH, are you sure I can take him, I mean you got defeated right here!" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I don't know. Find. Out. I can't really get you out of here without him, so... Good Luck?"
said Jomi, clearly having her fingers crossed.

"Uh, sige, mamatay naman din ako anyway, uh sasama ka ba?" said Ikari.

"Soon. I guess you can fight hanggang makapunta ako." said Jomi.

"Ok... See ya'!" said Ikari before going to the same door that Mijo went.

<!--Attempt at Fight Scene-->
# Random DR Fight

One day, in the Playas Cemetery....

"I... don't know what to say, honestly.." said Mijo.

"Yeah, guess so, but you can get the advice of our dead family over here." said Jomi.

"What? But I have my parents right there!" said Mijo, pointing to his parents.

"Can they even see me?" said Jomi.

"Oh definitely, I just said that you were a friend in school that also went here." said Mijo.

"Right, and they won't notice the... similarities?" said Jomi.

"Think so, i'll just say it's a coincidence, and besides, no one will look that far unless they're my friends..." said Mijo.

"Ok... and they won't notice how I have no parents or where they even are???" said Jomi.

"Relax... We're here to talk about life and.. Her. Don't worry, I gooot this. If I need help, I'll ask you, ok?" said Mijo.

"Alright, alright, I don't trust you, but you are the only one that can do anything about that, anyways, so-" said Jomi,

Before a large dark fountain opened right in the center of the cemetery, Mijo and Jomi quickly rushed to see what was happening, but got sucked into the dark world before seeing the fountain opener. They landed at the part where the fountain was, but it was basically the cemetery but dark, so off they go exploring again.

"Ah shit, didn't got time to-" said Mijo.

"Ok, relax Mijo, it's just a dark world, the only thing we need to do is quickly close it, so nothing significant happens." said Jomi.

"Good point, but if the fountain isn't here then..." said Mijo, thinking then he said, "Maybe..." before getting cut off by Jomi.

"Oh, its right there!" Jomi points to the fountain near where they were just talking in the light world.

"Sweet, it's one of those easy ones." said Mijo.

They quickly rushed to the fountain and as Mijo was closing it, someone blasted Mijo away from the fountain.

"Oof, sino ka!" said Mijo as he gets up.

"Hahaha... What's up!" said someone.

"Wait, you are... Cajo!" said Jomi.

"Who the fuck is Cajo?" said Mijo.

"Let me introduce myself, so you know how those dark fountains open without you? That's me!" said Cajo.

"What? No, that was Doctor G and Cara right?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, and I work with them, I opened those, not them." said Cajo.

"Ok... Who are you, lightner? darkner? Just who are you exactly?" said Mijo.

"Oh, uh... I come from nowhere!" said Cajo.

"Really, you can't even say where you even come from?" said Jomi.

"WHAT? Do you know me?" said Cajo.

"Well actually yes, you are Cajo, the lightner that was dissatisfied... I guess you got broken out by those two..." said Jomi.

"Oh, OH! YOU... You. Ikaw ah... Papatayin ko kita ngayon!!" said Cajo.

"Nope, not on my watch." said Mijo.

"Ok, Mijo. LET'S DANCE!" said Cajo.

<!--FEB 29 SPINOFF FUN SHORT LORE BREAK-->
# DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after S1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!
