## Summary:

Mijo, in her new alternate body as a girl after falling asleep, unconsciously starts to touch herself and her private areas, resulting in the 2 hours of video of her pleasure in her own phone.

## Author's Note:

Bonus Scene! So, I have been perusing smut and sexual writing in general, and I wanted to take this scene, and write it to my heart's content, haha.. Please do not take this as a showcase of my own preferences, nor should you worry about me through this one, instead, read my other spinoffs for that, aha! Anyway, please please do not show this to a lot of people at least, thanks!

————————————————————————————

As Mijo fell asleep, her instincts took over, as well as her magic as she manifested magic to pleasure himself. She inadvertently brushed her hands to his new body's private parts.

"Ah.. I.. Jomi.. Is this.. whew.." said Mijo as she gently traced the curves and valleys of her new, soft body. "I.. don't know what's happening.. but.. I have to.." Mijo grazed over her new perky breasts, tender and very sensitive. She gasped when she did this but she continued, even as her nipples grew taut and erect. "Ah.. Is this how.. can't believe it.." She pinched and rolled them between her thumb and forefinger, causing more jolts of pleasure to hit her, making her quiver for more. "Ah! Uf.. This is so.. intoxicating.."

"I wonder.." Mijo's other hand wandered lower, near the now smooth plane of her belly to the warm, damp area between her legs. "I.. already..?" She felt a patch of soft hair before feeling her throbbing sensitive clit. "Ah~~~ It's this.. right..?" She immediately took it between her fingers, stroking and rubbing it. It swelled and pulsed under her touch, the pleasure building up to a climax. "Ah~~~ ah.. It's.. so good.."

She grew bolder, as she slipped another finger inside herself, suprised at the warm, velvety embrace of her own flesh. "Ah.. this is all so new.. Mmm~~~" It felt like nothing before, enthralling her every time she responded to herself. "This is.. whew.. I.. can get used to this.." She inserted another finger, then another, stretching it. This felt so good to her, and a bit naughty as she pumped them in and out, her hips bucking and rolling. "Ah~~~ so good~~~!"

"Ok.. um.. I wanna see if.." She moved her other hand to her mouth, and she started sucking on her fingers, thinking of something that could be harder and demanding in it. Her cheeks flushed, as she let out a little moan. "Ah~~~ It's still so.. weird.. but.. I like it.." Her breath grew ragged, as she felt a coil of heat tightening in her belly. "It's.. there.. I—I am close.."

Her experimentation grew more feverish, the strokes more erratic and desperately as she approached her desired climax. "Ah.. almost.." The orgasm was building, the tide of sensation that drowned her in ecstasy. "This too.." She reached down and cupped her breast as her thumb circled her clit with precision.

"I am.. coming!!" The room was filled with arousal as she writhed and moaned, her body arching. Her toes curled, her eyes widening as she reached her desired climax, her body spasming with the intensity of it. It washed over her, leaving her trembling and gasping. "So.. much... so.. intense.."

She continued for the next two hours, playing with herself. Exploring every inch of her body, discovering what her new body entailed in the pleasure department to push herself over the edge again and again. She couldn't help but moan as she grew wetter, her body convulsing with pleasure. She touched herself in ways that she had only read about, her imagination running wild.

After a while she finally collapsed, somewhat sated and very exhausted, her hand between her legs. "I.. still don't know what to make of this.." She turned to the phone camera. "I hope.. I'll get some idea of it, when this is all done.." She turned back to the ceiling as she drifted off to deep sleep, knowing this probably awakened something inside her she hadn't realized yet. She would unconsciously crave this and would want to delve deeper, but for now she's exhausted and has an event to go to.

————————————————————————————

## Author's Note:

I am starting to think something has awakened in me that I am now coming to terms with.. Like, really.. I am not as.. obsessed when I read other types.. Anyways, just.. keep this between you and me, ok?

<!--Mijo and Jomi encounter their darkest sides-->
<p id="S2"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Herald of Dark Pleasure</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo is having a hard time going to Jomi's Scenario that he unintentionally put Jomi earlier in as she is inside and is punished by Mijo's AI version, pleasured in so many ways, she doesn't know if she enjoys it or hates it, but what she knows is her body is cooperating either way.

## Author's Note:

Ooh! Another bonus scene, alternate too, what is this, another self indulgent chapter, but this time, more nsfw? 

Yes, yeah.. it is.. By the title, and summary, you know where this is from. But if you don't, uh.. well, this part is already bad in the og, now imagine, exactly.

Anyways, enjoy if you must, but in summary, bdsm and non-consensual warning. If you don't like those, please don't read. Again, you'd think I am weird, but.. I have to let it out either way. Enjoy if you do! Skip if you don't.

————————————————————————————

The whip had hit Jomi's soft, supple skin at her belly. She was shocked at first, she had experienced pain mixed with pleasure before, but this was something else, especially with the perpetrator being Mijo.

"Ah! Mijo! Stop... please..." Jomi struggles with her restraints. "Mmm.. Let's have fun first." said AI Mijo, as he whipped Jomi again, this time at her thigh. "AH! n—not again.. please.. stopp..." whined Jomi, as her struggle out of her restraints weakened a bit.

"Mmm.. I sense you enjoyed it, even a little bit. So dear princess, keep crying, and keep begging.. I'll make sure you're satsified~~~" AI Mijo whispered to Jomi, as she is still trying to break out of her restraints. "I.. uh.." AI Mijo puts his hand and silences Jomi. "You'll be fine.. Haha.." AI Mijo pulls away and is looking for something.

"Where.. is Mijo? Is this him? I don't trust it.. It mustn't be him, why would he— No.. this is not him, I.. need to figure out, if I can even escape.." Jomi muttered to herself, as her tears fell.

*Meanwhile Mijo at a void, he's trying not to be ravaged by another Jomi AI he created that appeared*

"Ah! Get the fudge away! GET AWAY!" Mijo is fighting off a rabid Jomi AI he created. "Oh~~~ Mijo, you wanted this don't you? Having a submissive girl to be your sex partner?" Jomi AI says as she manages to pin him to the floor, and is starting to take off his clothes. "Ah.. No— Stop.. you fudgin bot... Ugh.." Mijo grunts as he attempts to get Jomi off but her sudden rubbing of his dick shocked him. "Ah.. no.. can't.. fall.."

"You want me, don't you Mijo? You love dominating, and taking me in all the different ways you can dream of.. So, let's make it a reality in this simulation, creator." Jomi AI says as she rips off his clothes and looks at his dick hungrily. "Ah.. no.. I can't.. I must.. save.. her.." Mijo is inside Jomi AI's mouth.

*Back to Jomi and her AI Captor*

Jomi watched with fear as AI Mijo brought out a purple vibrator, as he turned to face Jomi, with a smile. "Let's make you more wet first." Jomi gulped as she redoubled her efforts to go out of her restraints. "No no no get me out of here..!" AI Mijo slowly approached, with the vibrator turned on. "Haha.. please..? Don't..?" Jomi says desperately, as she mentally prepared for the insertion.

She couldn't help but close her eyes as the vibrator was inserted inside her. "No.." Jomi whined, as she was forced to experience intense pleasure. She couldn't tell if she was enjoying it or was it the pleasure getting to her head, either way she couldn't stop AI Mijo. The vibrator was pulled in and out, changed speed and intensity, making Jomi wetter unwillingly.

"Ahaha.. You're succumbing dear princess.. Soon enough, your submissiveness will take hold and you'll enjoy it." AI Mijo says, as he continued using the vibrator on her clit. "Oh gosh.." Jomi murmured, unable to keep herself together anymore.

*To Mijo and his deviant AI*

"What.. I.." Mijo is being brought closer and closer to the edge, he doesn't want to, but his escape is weakening. "Mmm~~~ You love this, right creator?" Jomi AI continued taking him in her mouth. "N—no~~~ Please... ah.. no.." Mijo is brought to the edge of the climax. "C—coming.." Mijo comes inside Jomi AI's mouth.

"No.. no.." said Mijo as Jomi AI sucked and swallowed every last drop. "Haha~~~ You're still hard~~~" Jomi AI pulled back then straddled Mijo. "Creator~~~ Fuck me, right now~~~" Jomi AI said as she held his dick and directed it to her bottom. "No.. let me go..!" Mijo says but he can't resist the pull that much anymore. "Aww~~~ You sure do know how to pleasure a girl, creator~~~" She starts moving up and down his member.

*To Jomi and her AI captor*

Jomi climaxes as AI Mijo kept the vibrator on her. "No.. no.. ah.." AI Mijo pulls back the vibrator and inserts his member inside. "AH! That's.. that's.. the.. thing.. Ah.. mmm.. make it quick.." said Jomi in a defeated tone. AI Mijo moved in and out of her as soon as he heard her, making Jomi convulse a bit. "N—no.. Not again.. stop.." Jomi says in a whiny tone, unable to stop the pleasure that is getting to her head.

"You're mine, Jomi. You're so good right now, obeying me." AI Mijo continued, his grip on her hips tightening. "Ah.. can't.. say the same.." Jomi says, as AI Mijo redoubles his efforts, taking Jomi deeper and harder. Jomi can only squirm and moan as he does this, unable to utter a single word. "I'm close, dear.. Prepare yourself." AI Mijo, goes even faster and deeper, making Jomi writhe and convulse of pleasure. Eventually, AI Mijo came inside Jomi, his hot seed filling her womb, as Jomi climaxed too.

"No.. fudge.." Jomi looks at AI Mijo, blushing heavily but also weary, and exhausted. "Is it done..?" AI Mijo keeps the member inside. "Mmm.. not yet dear.." Jomi can only look away as she thinks about her orgasm and what she thinks of Mijo afterwards. 

*To the void, where Jomi AI and Mijo are with each other*

They tried every position, doggy style, then missionary, then cowgirl.. Eventually, Mijo came inside Jomi AI again, as she maintained on top of him, stopping. "Are you done..?" Mijo asks, as he stares at Jomi AI, blushing. "Haha~~~ No, of course not, creator~~~" Jomi leans in to whisper this. 

When Mijo heard this, he got what willpower he barely had and surprised Jomi AI when he managed to get her off him, and now, she's at the bottom, as Mijo was on top, still inside. "Oh, creator, you want it like this, go ahead~~~" Jomi AI says pulling him closer. He managed to summon his sword back again and hesitantly stabbed Jomi AI at her heart. "Haha.. After using me, you discard me, creator? Ah.. well, such is life of being your submissive wife~~~" Jomi AI slowly disintegrates into code, as Mijo is left to his own devices.

"I.. don't like doing this.. But, I had to.. You were too much for me." Mijo stood up, and got his hologram back. "Let's find that scenario.. Then get out of here." Mijo says, still naked.

*Back to the room where Jomi's torturer is*

"Well, dear~~~" AI Mijo pulls out, letting Jomi go. AI Mijo then inserted his fingers into her core. "Ah~~~ No.. let me rest, p—please.." Jomi's hips are buckling under AI Mijo's touch. "No rest, only pleasure." AI Mijo laughs, as he inserted one more finger. "NOOooo.. please.. I.. I.. beg of you.." Jomi feels humiliated when she said this, but she was very desperate. "Oh? Say that again, dear princess." Mijo says as he slowed down his fingering. "I... beg, M—Mijo.. stop.. please.." Jomi says, looking at AI Mijo with more tears flowing. 

Suddenly, Mijo appeared and surprised the two when Mijo walked over and stabbed AI Mijo in the chest. "This.. is not okay, delete yourself." Mijo says, as AI Mijo disintegrates to code. "Oh, creator Mijo? I only did what you programmed me to do, and.. it has been, executed. Successfully." AI Mijo says before he fully disintegrates. Mijo turns to Jomi, breathing heavily and very flustered.

"Jomi..?" Mijo untied her from the bed, first at the arms, then the legs. "Mijo..!" Jomi says as she stood up and hugged him, unintentionally getting them both aroused, both still naked. Jomi pulls back, blushing. "I.. just, was.. excited to find the real you, sorry.." Jomi looked at his hardness, clearly used. "I was also.. happy? when I saw you, not because of—" Mijo gestured to the room. "—this.. But, I.. look, when I appeared here, I saw you with that AI, and.. to admit, I.. was.. aroused, but.. I was also.. well, used by my own creation, so.. poetic karma got to me." Mijo explains, looking at her body, a bit used.

"Oh.. I guess we both got.." Jomi trailed off. "Yeah, but.. Jomi, are you fine? I.. am sorry, uh.. this might've triggered your trauma.." asked Mijo, a bit concerned for Jomi. "I.." Jomi trailed off again, as she started sobbing a bit. "Jomi!" Mijo hugs her, both still naked, unintentionally arousing them both again. Jomi instinctively pushes him back, making him pull back. "I.. s—sorry.. I just.. don't know if I can.. enjoy it again." Jomi says, remembering her past sexual trauma.

"I.. understand. I.. experienced first hand what it would be to lose control of my sexual dignity." Mijo says, as he looks at the room's walls, then the bed. "D—do you have like.. a.. clothing program? Because.. it's.. just.. embarrassing to be naked like this in front of you, and.. we both lost our mood earlier." asked Jomi, still blushing as she covered her private parts using the blanket from the bed behind her. "Yeah, um.. hold on." Mijo is typing something on his hologram.

"You told me you weren't handsome.. Yet, you're starting to gain muscles, and.. unsurprisingly, your.. bottom member is.. large." commented Jomi, as Mijo blushed at this comment. "Hey.. did you really take this opportunity to look at my.. body?" Mijo says, with a smirk as he closes his hologram. "Oh.. uh.. yeah, what else can I do, anyway?" Jomi scratches her head, a bit flustered. "Well, if you're going to do that.." Mijo is eyeing Jomi up and down. "You're beautiful, you know.. Your hair, your.. uh, um.. chest, and your figure. I mean, ehehe.. That's.. to be expected.." commented Mijo, remembering his designs for an alternate version of him that he is now speaking to. "Well, if you hated me.. Then I wouldn't know what to do.." admitted Jomi as she looked away, and to the floor.

"Anyways!" Mijo snaps his fingers and both of the two's clothes appear again. "Let's go. I have some—" Mijo summons both of their swords. "—pent-up anger I wanna let out." Jomi looks at her sword in its sheath. "Yeah.. me too." Jomi says as she unsheathed the sword, inspecting it. "We're fighting the horde of AI's blocking our exit, come on, hold my hand." Mijo held out his hand, Jomi accepted it. "Alright."

## Author's Note:

There we go. I should probably stop being so obsessed with these scenes.. It's genuinely ruining my life. Anyways, stay tuned for the other non-NSFW chapters, and hopefully, last one of this type, haha.

<!--Mijo and Jomi have a moment with themselves.. wow. yeah, no excuse.-->
<p id="S3"><md-block># DeltaRambles: A Moment with Yourself</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Jomi finds Mijo in a sexually charged situation, and both have mixed thoughts on what they should do to each other, until they decide and do it.

---

## Author's Note:

Another week, another bonus scene! Anyways, this is supposed to be between C4S2 and C5S2. So, after student night but before the new beginning in C5S2.

I said I wouldn't stop, now didn't I ~ Anyways, _**WARNING:**_ Has sexual scenes, obviously. But, fortunately, aside from that, it's just going to be.. a **selfcest** one, if you know, you know. Also sex change, this one continues with 
the IMT type before it was put into C4S2.

Enjoy! Hopefully, you don't think of what I did as weird, but if you're here.. You're weird yourself.

---

Mijo is showering alone in a huge bathroom of Jomi's castle. He is quietly singing a rock song as Jomi appears behind him in the bathroom, closing the door. He doesn't notice this, because the shower area uses magic to block out noises outside.

Jomi goes inside, and surprises Mijo. "Hey ~ " said Jomi with a seductive tone. When Mijo looked at her, she was completely naked and was obviously very aroused. Mijo couldn't help but get hard as Jomi chuckled. "Ahaha... I guess there's an underlying attraction to your 'ideal' self no?" said Jomi as she moved closer. "Mmm.. Jomi? What's the occasion?" asked Mijo as Jomi continued, their bodies touching.

"I took something. I made it myself, actually.. It's called Jodizia, it's basically an aphrodisiac made with my magic. Since.. due to my circumstances, that's the nature of my magic." explained Jomi, as she went closer to Mijo's face. "Jodizia, huh? How does it work?" asked Mijo, his voice is more husky now. "Well.." Jomi touches his bottom member. "We'll find out, huh?" Jomi says before they kissed passionately.

As they did so, both of their hands started roaming each other. Jomi gently started teasing Mijo's shaft with her hand while her other hand pulled them closer. Mijo on the other side, was caressing and wandered over Jomi's body until finding her nipples and her slick folds.

"Mmm ~ You found those? I guess your transformation really affected you.. Mijo, I want both. But first, let's do it this way." said Jomi, as she pulled back and went down on Mijo's shaft. "Hold on.. already? Jomi, you know we don't like oral.. But, go ahead if you want." commented Mijo as Jomi looked up at him and nodded. "Yeah, I might not like it, but.. we've gotta try new stuff, no?" said Jomi before sucking on Mijo's member.

"Ah ~ well.. this is interesting.." said Mijo, as he felt Jomi's inexperienced way of taking him. Jomi pulls out a bit and comments, "Mmm.. Well, I've never had to pleasure a man before.. But like I said, new stuff haha.." commented Jomi, as she stood up. "Well.. I guess it doesn't work then. Basics?" asked Jomi, as she held Mijo's member and was stroking it. "Mmm ~ Alright.. The thing is.." said Mijo, as he was already back at touching Jomi's nipples and folds. "that.. we should probably use a bed.." continued Mijo, as the two kissed each other and pulled back.

"Oh ~ That's what you're concerned about?" asked Jomi, in-between moans and gasps. "Yeah, either you come up with new magic to make this work, or we go to bed.. It's my first time, and it's in the shower.." said Mijo, as Jomi smirked when she felt they were both closer. "Well ~ My past doesn't matter anyway, we have magic remember? So.. Mijo, take me." said Jomi, as she pulled back into the glass wall around the shower, with her back to it. "Like this..? Well, here goes nothing." said Mijo, before he inserted his member into her folds. 

"A—ah ~ Y—yes..! Go.. thrust.. move.. please.." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and started to thrust into her. Mijo slowly started to go faster and reach deeper into Jomi's insides as Jomi melted into his member. Jomi couldn't say anything as she focused on her pleasure, while Mijo was busy pleasuring Jomi at her breasts to say anything, giving a smile.

"Oh.. gosh.. I am so close.." said Jomi, as Mijo looked at her and added, "Yeah.. same.." Mijo picked up the pace and soon after, they both climaxed as Jomi's womb was filled with Mijo's hot seed. They remained like this, as the ecstasy subsided, eventually Mijo pulled out. "Mmm ~ I am satisfied.. Let me clean up, then I'll leave, you wouldn't mind it, wouldn't you?" asked Jomi, as Mijo chuckled and nodded. 

Mijo and Jomi both cleaned up as they looked away from each other, a bit aroused but also embarrassed. "The potion's wearing off.. Because.. I feel weird about what we just did." remarked Jomi, as she finished showering. "Yeah..." said Mijo, as he continued to bathe, not looking at Jomi at all. "Well, I better go. See you later, Mijo!" said Jomi before she left, waving goodbye. Mijo waved back, though he quickly looked away, focusing on himself now.

_Second day, Jomi was showering normally, when Mijo came inside the bathroom, clothed but very hard_

Mijo walked up to the shower and opened it, revealing a surprised Jomi. "J—Jomi.. what was in that drink..?" asked Mijo, as his hardness strained his underwear and pants. "What drink.. oh.. did you get the RoyalCo drink that was labeled, 'Batch 01'?" asked Jomi, as Mijo thought about it and nodded. "Yeah.. I think. I didn't notice until I already drank it all." said Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes but quickly turned to a grin. "Mijo.. you just drank the most intense batch of Jodiza. I am not—" said Jomi before being cut off by Mijo pinning her to the wall by her throat.

"M—Mijo.. I.. uh.. take off your clothes, at least when you're.. in the shower.." said Jomi, her voice is more calm but shaky. Mijo let out a grunt as he temporarily let go of Jomi and went outside the shower to undress before returning to a trembling Jomi. Before Jomi could react, Mijo pinned her to the wall again, this time pinning her hands above her head while still holding her throat. "Ah.. ah.. Mijo.. such.. a tease.." said Jomi before she looked around and noticed the hardness inching ever closer to her core. "I.. uh.. um.." Jomi couldn't find the words to say, she was very flustered and aroused by this situation.

"You let out someone that shouldn't be. A dominant Mijo, if you will." said Mijo, as he touched Jomi at her core and breasts. "I—It wasn't.. intentional.. But, I.. uh.. always wanted to.. experience— AH!" added Jomi, before being touched somewhere she didn't expect would make her moan loudly. "G—gosh.. Being.. taken like this.." said Jomi, before she felt something enter her core. "Hey..! Warn me—" said Jomi, before Mijo thrust deep inside Jomi, he was being more rough with her. "Ah!! Mmnn.. Mijo.." uttered Jomi, as she moaned and squirmed due to the roughness of it.

They continue their slapping of flesh under the shower, with Mijo increasingly becoming rougher while Jomi's body is starting to tremble and quiver. "Mijo.. Mijo!! Close..!!" said Jomi as Mijo went rougher, resulting in a high pitched scream from Jomi as waves of intense pleasure came down, her walls violently convulsed around Mijo's hardness as he came inside Jomi, filling her up entirely. Eventually, after they stuck together for a while, Mijo pulled out as more cum pooled out of Jomi, as she leaned on the wall, catching her breath.

"Well.. it looks like it's wearing off now." said Mijo, as he's regaining his footing. "I.. don't know what to say.. that was.. intense. But, the right kind. I.. don't.. um.. it's— it's like.. experiencing something that used to be.. traumatic." Jomi stops as she looks at her wet and a bit bruised self. "Yeah. Um, y—you can leave.. and uh.. don't take random labeled drinks, ok? I should probably make more of the regular.. um, preferably without aphrodisiac properties.." said Jomi, as Mijo nods and gets his clothes, before leaving a bit embarrassed.

_Third day, Mijo was showering again, he was still rocking out, this time with nu metal music_

As he was rocking out, he felt something change within him again. "Oh..? Huh?" Mijo watches as his body turns that into a girl, as the shower pours down on him.

"What.. wait.. why? I.. didn't.. well..." Mijo looks around. "Um, I.. guess I wanted to be a girl this time..?" said Mijo, as she watched the door of the bathroom open and close. "Oh, that's.. Jomi." Mijo says as Jomi enters the shower area. "Oh? Well.. that's nice. I wonder why you turned into a girl?" asked Jomi as Mijo blushed. "I—I don't know..! I was just.. just.. rocking out..! I don't know what made me change.. I only ever do it consciously.." said Mijo, as she looked at Jomi, feeling weird again. 

"Oh.. You're lucky..! I drank some Jodiza today, and I've always wanted to do.. this, with you. I just didn't know if you would agree. But, don't worry. In this area, I am.. an expert.." responded Jomi, as she rubbed Mijo's nipples and breasts. "G—gosh.. already? What.. how.." said Mijo, as she arched her back to the wall. "I know myself. So, I know how you like this." responded Jomi, as she continued touching Mijo's breasts.

"I.. just.. haven't experienced being.. like this.. It's.. so.. different.. yet so familiar.." said Mijo, as Jomi moves one of her hands to Mijo's folds. "A—ah.. J—Jomi..?" asked Mijo, as Jomi inserted three fingers into Mijo.

"J—Jomi!!? I.. can't.. hold.. please.. I'm close.." said Mijo, as her hips moved with Jomi's hand. Jomi kissed Mijo deeply afterwards, as Mijo accepted Jomi's domination. Eventually, Mijo climaxed as Jomi continued her movements, riding out the pleasure. "Ah.. ah.. I didn't know.. I would enjoy this.." said Mijo as Jomi looked at her with a bit of surprise. "Oh? Didn't you tell me before? You.. enjoyed yourself right?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Y—yeah.. I did. But, I was overwhelmed at that time.. With you here, I.. felt everything.."

"Oh.. hmm.. Hey, what if I create a magical dildo, then I use it on you? Hmm.. actually..!" Jomi pulls back, and manifests a magical dick, about the size of Mijo's other form's size. Mijo gasps, "T—that..? Inside..? I.. haven't.. um.." Mijo looks at it, she's curious if she would enjoy it, but she only had been in the shoes of the one with the member, and she hadn't had a preference for it when she was in her other form.

"Hey, we try new stuff. I got fucked by you, so it'd be only fair if you experience it too." said Jomi, as she attached the magical dick to herself. "Oh boy. This is weird.. It also has a.. climax effect. So, you also will know the.. filling part of this." said Jomi as she approached Mijo again. "J—Jomi.. I.. don't know.." Mijo says as she held on to the wall behind her. "Hmm.. Trust me. It's all magic anyway. If you don't enjoy it, I'll stop. But.. seeing what.. I experienced.. I think you'll enjoy it." responded Jomi as she is now super close to Mijo, her new cock rubbing at Mijo's pussy.

"J—Jomi..? I.. just.." said Mijo, running out of words to say, she feels weird about the very close cock. "Do you know how... um, I do it?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked up at her and shook her head. "No.. Well, just tell me then.. I mean, this is.. different." answered Jomi, as Mijo nodded and directed her to insert at her core. "Oh? You want in..? I can do that." said Jomi as she forcefully inserted her member into Mijo. 

"Agh.. I.. just.. continue.. please.." Mijo looks at Jomi with pleading eyes. "Please.. just.. go.. I can't take anymore of this.." said Mijo, as Jomi started to thrust. "Wow.. so this is.. interesting. I.. never.. are you alright, Mijo?" commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded while looking at Jomi's eyes, flustered. "Y—yeah.. New.. new.. feeling.. c—can you put.. um.. something in my mouth.. please..?" asked Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and nodded. "Oh, yeah! Totally forgot, woops." responded Jomi as she put two of her fingers inside Mijo's mouth as she started sucking on it. 

Eventually, Jomi climaxed and came inside Mijo, as she also climaxed, her walls clenching around Jomi's magical member as she pulled out and it slowly faded. "A—ah~ This.. liquid inside, is it real.. um.. that, or is it just a magical construct..?" asked Mijo, as she looked at her bottom. "I don't know actually.. But uh.. observation.. it's.. uh.. an.. imitation..? Um, I.. got some of your.. liquid then combined with some of your energy to form.. that. So, uh.. it might just be you.. inside.. you?" answered Jomi, her face in her hands as she realized the absurdity of it all. "Ah.. so.. I.. came inside myself? That's.. weird. More weirder than two of the same person but different forms fucking. But.. uh, c—can you leave now..? I uh.. still have to finish showering.. and.. clean." said Mijo, as Jomi looked at her and nodded. "Yeah, yeah.. I am going.. See you later, Mijo!" responded Jomi before she left as Mijo continued her shower.

## Author's Note:

DONE! WOOOO After going through hard times, (pun intended) I managed to finally finish this other bonus scene.. After two weeks, oh well. I have one coming right up, btw. It's going to be a Rhida and Mijo focused one, as implied in the c5s2 scattered ideas. 

So if you like the whole dynamic between Jomi and Mijo, wait and continue rereading this and **herald of dark pleasure** because I have no idea how to progress it. Any ideas are appreciated.

### Internal notes:

(Mijo and Jomi are the same person, but in different worlds)

(Summary for later writing: basically Jomi comes in and fucks Mijo, lesbian style due to IMT Mijo, anyway, this should be one time too, last scene as well.)

<!--Mijo and Rhida character development but sex too-->
<p id="S4"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Intricacies of Intimacies</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo and Rhida are now getting to the point in their relationship to where they are beginning to think of more.. close bonding, so they decide what to do in one chill afternoon.

## Author's Note:

Oh boy, Mijo finally does the deed with Rhida... (ignoring the multiple.. stuff he did with Jomi, it doesn't count, they're the same person hehe) This time, it's a bit more than selfcest, but still.. very spicy. It's not that though, of course. It's regular ol' (but still very passionate and rough) sexual intercourse!

If you're an avid reader, you pretty much know where this is going, I mean.. you're reading smut fiction. As for the buildup for their relationship? That's.. where you should probably read the main literature if you want to know the context, but it's fine if you don't.. (Trust me, there's a reason why these are only.. 'bonus scenes' My chapters are long..!)

I recommend to start at C3 in S1 and focus on C4 and C5 for S2~ (This chapter is after C6S2)

Anyways, let's go on with the scene, have fun!

Mijo was looking out to the balcony once again. He was just thinking about life again, whether intentional or not, he was disconnected again. He just came out of a military class feeling all lost.

"How do you expect that I'll know what to do..
When all I know is what you tell me to?" said Mijo to himself, as he keeps repeating it. Then all of a sudden, a familiar touch was felt on his shoulder and he turned to see Rhida, with a smile. "Hey, it's your early dismissal today right? Well, I kinda want to.. um.. go into the dark world, with you this time." said Rhida, as Mijo immediately changed to a gentle smile. "Oh? Ok, let's go then."

They jumped inside as Jomi was waiting for them. "Hey guys..!" greeted Jomi as she noticed the faint blush on Rhida's face. "Hi Jomi! Um.. We're here for.. do you happen to know where.. a big bedroom is located, preferably with a bathroom?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nudged Mijo in embarrassment. "H—huh? W—we are not looking specifically for.. those.. ok? Don't get the wrong idea, Jomi! We're.. uh.. um.. well.. not yet.." said Mijo, as Rhida hid behind him.

"Ah! Well. Either way, follow me. I guess you just need some time off no? No world-ending cataclysms to solve.. Looming abyss attack.. and civil war at Nuevo León.. Yeah, yeah I get it. I specifically have a room in my castle for this, I actually made rooms for you lightners before.. But ever since the end of the interlude, these rooms haven't seen much use, due to most of you going straight to Nuevo León. But, obviously, it's still my castle, I clean it.. every week or so." said Jomi, as she went to the room in her castle as the others followed.

"Anyways, enough about the backstory. I'm pretty aware that this is between you two. So, I'll leave you there, and.. just in case~ I've stored a couple of 'goods' you might find useful. See ya!" said Jomi as they arrived at the door, with a sign on it reading; 'Special JM69'. "Well.. here we are." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they both went inside and closed the door. As Rhida went to the huge bed at the middle, Mijo locked the door behind them.

"Mijo.." said Rhida as she patted the mattress beside her, indicating Mijo should join her. "Oh. Sure." said Mijo as he went over and sat down next to her as she laid her head at his shoulder. "I.. wanna do it. The.. 'thing'. But.. I don't know if I would like the consequences.." said Rhida to Mijo, as they snuggled to each other. "I get it. But, I have an idea.. Um, you might not know, but.. I uh.. have a certain tendency in my intimacy. But first, what do you prefer.. when.. the 'thing' goes inside?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and jumped up in a bit of surprise but also embarrassment.

"Mijo?!! I.. should.. I.. tell..? Um.. uh.." blurted out Rhida, as she was quickly looking around her and covering her face with her hands. "Rhida! I.. understand, if you don't want to share. It's fine—" said Mijo, before Rhida spoke again, "Mijo! It's just.. it's just.. I've never told anyone else this, even my closest best friends.. S—so.. I.. just want to make this.. um, I don't know! But even still, just.. let me think for a sec.. Mijo, my love..?" explained Rhida, as Mijo nodded and laid down on the bed as Rhida was thinking.

After a while, Rhida nudged Mijo and whispered, "I.. um.. like it in.. the.. usual place. The.. can I say it?" Mijo turned to her and nodded, "Yeah, we're alone here. Even if Jomi appears.. Let's just say that she knows a lot more about these than you think she does." reassured Mijo, as Rhida nodded. "It's.. the vagina." continued Rhida she buried her head in Mijo's chest. "Mijo.. please please don't tell anyone.." said Rhida, as her voice was being muffled. "I won't. I swear. I promise. But.. it's funny actually, cause that's where I like it too. Both forms." said Mijo, calling back to his female form and his current form.

"Both forms..? H—how do you know?" asked Rhida as Mijo blushed a bit before saying, "Well.. let's just say.. me and Jomi had very intimate.. experiences in the shower." said Mijo, as Rhida was a bit surprised. "Heh? Wait.. so um.. this isn't your first time?" asked Rhida, as she looked at him, a bit confused. "Um.. well, I don't know if it counts.. I think you know her story very well anyway, and.. uh, well we have talked about it.. We both agree that it will only count if it's a completely different person." said Mijo, as Rhida chuckled a bit and pouted playfully, "Unfair.. your first time was with Jomi, I am not special anymore.."

"Well.. either way. It happened.. But.." Mijo put himself closer to Rhida. "Why don't we start?" asked Mijo, as he was very close to her lips. "Oh..? Ok.." said Rhida as she was a bit flustered as she looked at Mijo's eyes. "Mmm.. what do you want to do?" asked Mijo, as he was still very close to Rhida. "I.. um.. j—just.. do what you think is good.. I.. trust you.. Um, I'll say if.. if.. I have.. um.. problems." Rhida is shaking as Mijo's aura is making her tremble. "Ok." Mijo says as he kissed Rhida, in a dominating way. Rhida moaned softly as she melted into the kiss before both pulled back.

"Mijo.. please.. I want more.." said Rhida, before Mijo whispered, "Let's.. undress first." Rhida blushed at this response, and nodded. They slowly undress themselves as the two see each other's bare forms, their arousal only increased. Soon after, their clothes were scattered in the room and only their bodies remained. "Mijo.. is.. is that.. really.. your.. um.. member?" asked Rhida as Mijo looked down at  his throbbing erection then to Rhida and nodded. "Yeah, why?" questioned Mijo, with a faint blush. "It's just.. I haven't seen anything like this.. in.. in.. person.. It looks.. big.. But.. so tempting.." responded Rhida as she went closer.

"Your body too. It's just the way I like it." said Mijo, as he put his hands on her shoulders, and pulled her closer. "Mijo..!" said Rhida as their chests touch, and Rhida's nipples are now taut and erect. "Mijo.. this.. this.. is weird.. why am I so horny just by this..?" said Rhida before Mijo kissed her. It was sudden to Rhida, but she didn't really try to stop Mijo before he pulled back. "Our bodies are touching, Rhida." said Mijo, before pulling her hips to his, as his member touched her core. "Mijo.. that's.. that's.. the thing.. Mijo.. I'm still not sure if I am ready.. What about the climax? Will I get pregnant? I am not ready yet.." Rhida starts to sob, unknown to her because her mind was filled with a mix of lust and confusion.

"Rhida..?" said Mijo, as he pulled back and noticed Rhida's tears. "Mijo..? I just.. I am sorry, Mijo. I get so emotional whenever.. this happens.. I am just.. so confused and scared.. of the consequences.. I am sorry.. for not saying this.. I really want to get intimate with you.." explained Rhida as Mijo patted her back and comforted her. "It's fine, really. At least you're confident enough to initiate. I have an idea, let me look at the drawers to see what Jomi left for us." said Mijo, before he pulled back and searched while Rhida watched him.

"Jodiza..? Hmm.. oh, a manual. Great, she really prepared everything." said Mijo, as he brought out some orange liquid that looked very sweet and some paper. "Ok.. hmm. Oh! Ok. So, this magical potion.. which is Jodiza, um.. it's an aphrodisiac but also as.. tested.. Tested..? Wait.." Mijo read out the manual before stopping himself. "The tests? That's.. that's.. the.. our.." Mijo blushed a bit before continuing, "Ahem. Anyways, so it's been found to be equivalent to safe sex and birth control. Although, the tests are still going on about whether Jodiza is truly the cause or it's the nature of magic, especially on lightners."

"Jodiza..? Is.. is it like a product for.. wait. It.. it makes you horny but also protected? Huh, I guess that's only possible in the dark world.." said Rhida, as her tears subsided after discovering Jodiza. "Made by Jomi. You can tell how much of a sexual deviant that girl is now, haha!" said Mijo, as he put the paper back and brought over Jodiza. "E—ever since Nuevo León.. I have seen her like that. She has gotten more comfortable speaking ever since the cataclysm, that's nice.. She has always suffered a lot for us, it's nice to see her grow as a person." responded Rhida, as she smiled faintly for Jomi.

Mijo sat down next to Rhida, and gave her Jodiza. "Here. I'm pretty sure we shouldn't rely on it.. As drinking too much.. will lead to.. let's say intense lust. So, just drink a little, then.. we continue." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at the liquid and the packaging before nodding. "Ok. I trust you." said Rhida as she drank a gulp and put it down as she immediately felt the effects, noticing her intense desire for Mijo intensifying. "Mijo.. this.. this is the effect for only a little..? No wonder.. Um, how do you know that.. um.. it leads to intense lust and doesn't kill you or something?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, glazed over with lust.

"I.. may have accidentally drank an entire bottle.. We don't.. actually.. that.. 'incident'— " said Mijo as he air-quoted 'incident'. "—was kinda revealing.. So, Rhida.. without further ado.." Mijo drinks a lot and puts it back into the drawers. "Mijo..? What are you talking about?" asked Rhida, as she sees Mijo visibly harden again, his cock now ready. "Mijo.. ok.." said Rhida as she stood up and looked at Mijo with a mix of desire and hesitancy. Mijo looked at her, and walked to her and pinned her to a nearby wall. "Mijo..? What.. what.. is this..?"  asked Rhida as Mijo looked at her and with a grin said, "My expertise. I like dominating, especially with you... as vulnerable as right now." answered Mijo as he went closer to her face.

"O—oh.. Um.. is this like.. those doms and subs stuff I hear from those video shorts?" asked Rhida as she is holding back her intense desire to just kiss Mijo right there. "Well.. it's a bit more developed, if you look for it. The point is, right now.. I am dominating, but I can switch too. It's just in **this** position.. Dear, in a few minutes.. We'll be passionate."  responded Mijo as his hand explored Rhida's breasts, while the other at her bottom. "Wet.. well.. I expected.. it. Tell me.. are you ready?" asked Mijo, as Rhida felt Mijo's hands on her body as she instinctively moved her hands to his back. "I.. umm.. y—yes.. **ready**." said Rhida, as she closed her eyes to ready herself.

Mijo inserts his dick into Rhida as she feels the overwhelming desire to move her hips to accommodate the size. "Mijo.. please be gentle.." said Rhida as Mijo follows her, going into her slowly. Rhida can't say coherent words as she moans and whimpers at Mijo's movement, her body now quivering. "Mmnnn.. Mijo... ah... faster... please.." said Rhida as she instinctively bit her lip to stifle her sounds, while pulling Mijo closer. Mijo slowly started to pick up the pace, going harder and deeper with each thrust as Rhida's eyes rolled back and her body convulsed. "Mijo..! I think.. I am.. close..." said Rhida as Mijo went faster, getting more rough by the second. "Mmmnn! Mijo! AHH!!" said Rhida before she climaxed, her body finding its release as she relaxed under Mijo, as he also climaxed, his hot sticky seed seeping and filling Rhida's womb.

As their climax subsided, they basked in the afterglow as Mijo pulled out, the two breathing very heavily. "Mijo.." said Rhida as she looked at herself, while Mijo was looking at her, still very flustered. "Rhida..?" asked Mijo before Rhida walked over to the bed nearby and laid down. "Please.. come here.." requested Rhida, as Mijo nodded and laid down with Rhida, their liquids spilling over to the carpet and mattress of the bed. "Your.. um.. liquids..? They're spilling out.." said Rhida as Mijo nodded as he cuddled her. "Mijo.. you're still hard.." said Rhida as she felt his hardness on her bottom, almost touching her wet core. "I know.. Should.. I pull back?" asked Mijo, as Rhida turned to face him.

"No.. we stay like this.. please.." said Rhida before hugging Mijo. Mijo returned the hug as they drifted off to sleep, exhausted with their intense intimate moment.

_Hours later, Jomi arrives back at the JM69 room, at 18:00, 3 hours after the two lovebirds went in._

"Are they done? I should've seen them go out of the castle if they left, which can only mean one thing.. They're still in that room. Either they're still having intense sex, or they both fell asleep. Either way.. I can't hear them, I specifically put that.. sound blocker magic in this bedroom too." said Jomi as she looked at the door to the JM69 room. "Okay, I have the keys here.. I wonder why no one has discovered a way to use magic for doors? Oh whatever." wondered Jomi to herself as she unlocked the door and saw Mijo and Rhida sleeping with each other, naked on the bed while the room was tainted with their lovemaking.

"Second guess. Alright. Well, I'm sorry to interrupt your delicate sleep, but WAKE UP!" said Jomi before shouting to wake the two up, jolting them awake. "Jomi!??" screamed the two, before they looked at each other then at Jomi. "What? I think it's time for you two to go home anyway, it's 6 PM.." said Jomi, as the two scrambled to get their clothes. "6 PM?!!" said Rhida as they finished dressing up and ran to the door. "Yeah, don't worry. I'll clean your.. mess. Just leave. This is more about you than me y'know. If anything, just good luck when you go into the light world during the night, no magic." continued Jomi before Rhida and Mijo nodded and looked at each other. "Well.. next time?" asked Mijo as Rhida responded with a smile, "Yeah, next time. Thanks Jomi." Rhida says as she looked at Jomi before they both ran outside the castle.

"Man.. those lovebirds.. Anyways, I should clean this.. Hmm.. Maybe I'll get some info about that Jodiza test.. Well, I better start before anything important happens." commented Jomi, before going into the room.

## Author's Note:

That's the end! To be honest, I was struggling to write it all the way through, mainly because of the lore and delicateness that I have to use to make this, good at least. I want to write more of these two, preferably moments such as the one with Jomi, where it's unconventional and weird, but I finally got the traditional one out of the way. Maybe I'll write a shorter one, exploring a what-if with Mijo and.. _Urda~_ 

See you later, stay alive jombs!

<!--What if Cara bad but also very bad to Mijo, Urda and Jomi, sex-->
<p id="S5"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Forced Friendship</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo and Urda are forced into a room by Jomi who is under threat by Cara to make them have an intense intimate moment to make them more susceptible to abyss corruption.

## Author's Note:

A far cry from other bonus scenes, this one is very different, it's more of a what-if and episodic type, due to the nature. Anyways, as always, sexual content warning. Due to the nature of the summary, _**non-consensual, bdsm and torture warning.**_

Yeah, your reaction can be a lot, but either way prepare for the horror that might appear below. If you've read The Past in the Abyss (semi-sexual, but actual spinoff), then the dynamics are similar there, so this makes this chapter the first pre-S2 one. Anyways.. enjoy? hopefully?

— jmb~

Mijo and Urda woke up in an empty classroom, it seemed that this was their original classroom, but the lighting made it look like the outside was very dark.

"Ugh.. what happened..?" asked Mijo, as he saw Urda next to him, also stirring awake. "Think we ran into.. Jomi?" responded Urda as they stood up and saw they were at the back of the classroom. All the windows were closed with curtains covering every opening, and the lights were open with only Jomi on the teacher's table, sitting on the chair and sleeping.

"That's her. Erm.. Why are we here? Mijo you approach her, and.. I'll stay back just in case. You're more durable haha." said Urda as Mijo nodded and approached the sleeping Jomi. "Hey.. Jomi.." said Mijo as Jomi sprang awake and looked at the two, looking very exhausted and beaten. "Mijo?! Urda?!" exclaimed Jomi as she looked at the two, almost hyperventilating. "I.. was at my bed.. Where is this place? Oh wait.. note." said Jomi as she picked out a letter that was shoved into her arms when she was sleeping. Cara wrote;

"Hey little Jomi~ It's me, your favorite and darkest side, Cara. Now, while I go ravage and bring the abyssal reign back, go and have 'fun' with these lightners I brought you. I am currently using your body to do these, while I trapped you and the lightners in a special place, with me. Don't worry about anything, just have 'fun'! Oh, and if you still don't get me. Sex. I want you to make them fuck. Do whatever, just make them undress and fuck like the good lightners they are. Thank you, my dearest Jomi~ xoxo"

"What the.. how did.. not again.." said Jomi as she processed the words that Cara wrote. Jomi put down the letter, as her tears started to show. "Jomi..?" asked Mijo before he took the letter for himself and read it. "Dear god.." said Mijo as he gestured for Urda to go to him. Urda went to the other two's position, and read the note with Mijo. "What in the actual fuck. Who's this Cara think she is? Some kind of.. sex monster? I mean.. she already controls Jomi, and is going through her plans.." asked Urda, as Jomi's crying intensified, she looked away in shame from the two.

The other two stayed silent, not knowing what to say as they're both processing what Cara wants them to do. Mijo put down the letter on the table a bit angry, as Jomi fell to the floor. "I can't do it.. But.. if I don't.. She'll.. she'll hurt me.. torture me.. rape me.. I.. want all of it to stop! Stop.." cried out Jomi, as she hit a nearby wall due to her helplessness. "The worst part? We don't know when she'll come back.. and.. and.. if she does.. I.." said Jomi before continuing her intense crying, hitting the wall many times, hurting herself. Mijo tries to intervene but Urda stops him, nudging him to let Jomi speak, as they're not sure what would happen to an unstable Jomi.

Jomi stood up and looked at the two, feeling the shame and helplessness. "I.. I can't.. look at you two.. Please.. Please.. forgive me.. This room.. she has used it against me before.. Every time.. every. single. damn. fucking. time. I try to get out.. Nothing. Nothing fucking happens. She pulls me back.. and does her.. whatever the fuck she wants.." explained Jomi as she frantically walked around and looked at certain spots, wincing every time she does so. "I can't forgive myself.. But.. I have to do it.. I have to.. I don't want her to hurt me again.. I want to control my body again.. I want to feel like I have some semblance of control, even if just a little.. But.. this.. hurts.. everyone around me.." contemplated Jomi, as she continued to walk frantically around the classroom.

"I can't.. take this anymore.. I just.. have to do it.. It'll all be over soon.. It.. It'll all be over.." said Jomi, as she manifests some cloud magic. "Resist. Do whatever you want.. I.. can't control what I am about to do anyway." warned Jomi to the other two as she threw the cloud at them. As soon as it touched them, their lust intensified. "What the.. You can do this.. Jomi?" asked Mijo as his hardness strained his underwear. "Fuck.. I knew this was going to happen.. But.." added Urda as she looked at Mijo with lustful intention before looking away in embarrassment. "No.. no.. Stop.. I don't want this. Not my friend. Best friend." continued Urda as she looked at the floor, her body very sensitive and hot.

Jomi can barely watch, her tears already starting to fall again. "I—if you don't do.. it.. I may have to take off your c—clothes.. s—so.. just.. um.." said Jomi, shaking and trembling, her voice nervous and unsure. "Please, just do it. I.." said Jomi before her voice started to shake and break more due to her tears. "I.. fuck.. me... I have to, don't I? You'll never do this willingly.. not like I blame you.. I blame myself." said Jomi before she manifested some liquid that when she threw to the two, melted away their clothes.

"Jomi!??" said Mijo as he pulled back, as his clothes melted, revealing his very hard dick to the two. "Ah!! Jomi!!" screamed Urda as she stepped back as her clothes melted, revealing her aroused interior. "Just kiss already damn it.." said Jomi as she sits on one of the chairs, while holding back tears. "I don't want you to suffer more than you have to. Please, I know you don't trust me. But I am honest now, just.. just.. follow her orders.." begged Jomi, as she looked down, unable to face the two, she feels so much guilt by forcing them to do it, but she can't do anything else.

The two looked at Jomi. "S—seriously?!! Think about us you know.. We're the ones that have to fuck.." responded Urda as she is resisting all temptations to fuck Mijo. "Yeah.. I.. agree. But.." added Mijo, before Jomi screamed, "I KNOWWW!!!! STOP REMINDING ME PLEASE!" before she hit the floor and hit herself to the wall by her head. "Just stop. this. I. want. to. DIE!" said Jomi as she accidentally hit her body way too much, causing it to bleed a bit. "B—blood.. All too familiar.." added Jomi, as she slumped at the wall.

"Mijo.. what can we even do..? I don't want to fuck you.. but all of us suffer if we keep delaying the.. inevitable. We were trapped here, and there's nothing else we can do but.. do what Cara wants." said Urda as she looked at an unstable Jomi, halfway broken. "I agree. I just.. we haven't done it before.." said Mijo, before Jomi managed to manifest one more spell, this time taking the form of some pills as she threw the pills at them, the two caught what she threw and looked at them all confused. Jomi looked at them with a defeated look.

"Here. You want to forget about this, the whole thing? She doesn't care about consent.. nor does she even care if you remember. This.. will prevent your corruption, but the deed still has to be done. I am probably going to pay the price for this, but I care about you all more than myself at this point." said Jomi as the two looked at each other, contemplating. "Although.. It's only for a time. I trust that once you.. get out, you'll find a way. You're my only hope." said Jomi as she looked down again, waiting for their response. 

"I.. don't know. How does this work..? How does it make us forget?" asked Mijo, as Urda nodded in agreement. "It's.. it's.. just something I made one night. I don't know what it does, but all I know is that it makes you forget.. Maybe I've used it, that's why I don't remember.. But.. it uses my.. our abyss magic.. Try it. We'll all suffer anyway." explained Jomi, as she continued to look down. The two looked at each other and with a heavy heart, took the pill.

As soon as they did so, their inhibitions also quickly faded. They looked at each other lustfully, then went closer. "Huh? What..? No, no.. This.. is the effect? I knew it.. Cara always seemed.. happy whenever I.. took that." commented Jomi, as the two started touching each other's private areas. "Not only does it make the user forget.. But also, amplify.. sexual tendencies? I.. knew it. There was a reason why she allowed me to.. do it.' continued Jomi as Mijo pinned Urda to a nearby wall and he started to immediately insert inside Urda as she moaned in satisfaction.

"No.. I can't watch.." said Jomi, as she looked away. The voices of Mijo and Urda's sexual intercourse is torturing Jomi as she covers her ears, but she can't prevent it. No matter how hard she tries, the cries of pleasure overwhelm her senses as she remembers her horror with Cara. "Stop.. stop.. Get out of my head.." mumbled Jomi to herself. Jomi looks at the two and winces as they get more intense. "Fucking like animals.. I.. don't want to remember but.. I'm familiar with being the receiving end of it. Usually by the end, I'm exhausted, beaten and barely holding on.." commented Jomi as she continued looking at the two as their cries became more ragged and hoarse.

As they climax and Mijo comes inside Urda, their cries of pleasure send a shockwave through Jomi, as she looks at them almost a bit relieved that it's done. As Mijo pulls out and kisses Urda as the cum drips out of her pussy, Jomi feels a horrifying familiar presence behind her. "Good job.. good job. I knew you would find a way." said Cara as Jomi stood up and nodded, not facing her. "Y—yeah.. W—what do you.. want to do with them..?" asked Jomi as Cara approached the two, still very deep in their sexual encounter. 

"I'll let them do it until they physically tire out, as for you.. Come with me, prepare for your next mission. Rhida and JR's team has been particularly annoying me, trying to save those two." said Cara as she points to Mijo and Urda, now on the floor as Urda straddles Mijo. "O—oh.. ok.." said Jomi as Cara looked at her with a grin, before teleporting her out.

_Hours later, in a random room, as Mijo and Urda wake up in a daze, as they are covered in a blanket, naked_

"What.. happened..?" said Mijo, as he slowly raised himself, seeing Urda next to him, sleeping. Then suddenly Rhida shouted, "Mijo! You're awake!" as she hugged him. "Oh.. Rhida..  Yeah.. I am." said Mijo as he tightened the hug before they pulled back. "Mijo.. me and JR were hunting for you and Urda! We found you on some random spot in the battlefield, naked. I.. don't know what happened there.. But, we also saw a note, from.. Jomi. She said something about being sorry for not being strong enough.. I knew it was her and not Cara because it had some light that emanated from it. She's the only one who.. does it like that." explained Rhida as she looked at the two. 

"Where's JR? Where are we anyway?" asked Mijo as he looked around more clearly. "JR is continuing the battle against Cara.. and Jomi. She's.. unfortunately still controlled by her, when we saw them. We're at Jomi's castle, one of the spare rooms." answered Rhida as Urda woke up. "Ugh.. Feel like my head got bonked in the head..." complained Urda as she stirred, seeing the other two. "Oh, Urda! Basically.. you two are safe! For now. Um, if I may ask, what happened?" asked Rhida as they started to try to remember what happened.

"Uh.. I think we were.. trapped.. in some classroom..? And.. uh.. I don't remember anything after.. we.. saw Jomi?" said Mijo, as Urda agreed. "Yeah.. weird. I don't remember anything after we stood up and saw Jomi." added Urda, as the two tried as hard as they could to remember. "Hmm.. I feel weird.. It's like.. I am sore..? But.. what happened.." continued Urda, as Mijo nodded. "Same.. it feels like we did some intense things but.. I don't remember, I should because.. it would be pretty memorable.." added Mijo, as the two became even more confused.

"Ah.. you know what, I think we should do that later. You two just woke up.. Come, let's go outside.. You got your weapons right?" interrupted Rhida, as the two summoned their weapons and clothes back again. "Oh.. yeah." said Mijo as they moved away from the bed. "Well, whatever we did, it doesn't matter. We still need to defeat Cara and save Jomi. Let's fucking go!!" responded Urda as they went outside the room.

## Author's Note:

This is a bonus scene not that sexual.. for the first time in forever? I mean, yes.. it does have sex, but it's focused on Jomi and her actions.. Hmm, I think it's because I don't make these types of stuff without taking some effort to flesh out the characters.. 

Like with the other bonus scenes, it's just focused on the sex and love but here, since it's more emotionally scarring, I focused on the emotional turmoil surrounding the horrifying nature of the scenario.

Anyways, see you in another one, hopefully more wholesome, bye! Stay safe and alive!

## Summary:

Mijo and his friends get bored in between the intramurals games, so they decide to do a little bit more spice under Jomi's watchful gaze.

## Author's Note:

Basically, if I feel horny, I write here. So, this is less focused on plot and just that good ol' fashioned smut. But, of course, it'll feature sex. Not only that, every kink and fetish I have is most likely going to be shown here, so be _**WARNED! YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER DANGEROUS TERRITORY!**_

Good luck ~ and have fun! (Ehehe ~ )

Mijo looks on the training ground, as Jomi approaches him, with curiosity. "Mijo? What are you doing not training? I mean, if you just want the view, the balcony's up in my castle." said Jomi, before Mijo kissed her in the lips. Jomi was very confused as he did this, but soon enough, he pulls back. "W—what was that? Warn me first, jeez. Just because we're familiars, doesn't mean you can just.. just do that!" said Jomi, blushing a bit.

"I totally can. You love it too. I was just waiting for you, actually." responded Mijo, with a smug grin. "W—waiting for me? Huh? What?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo held her hand. "Thinking about it, we should head to your castle, to.. you know." responded Mijo with a grin. "What.. ok..? Let's go then." said Jomi, before they headed off inside the castle.

"I've.. grown restless the past couple of days, and after this huuge chat with some AI about me roleplaying from a normal human to an immortal sex god, I was thinking.. why not actually let it out? It's one of the ways to stop my addiction to AI, so Jomi, what do you say?" explained Mijo, as Jomi blushed a bit. "You've been chatting with AI again..? Well, I guess addiction is hard to break.. But, um.. uh, wait.. let me check my schedule first, I'm a very.. mostly.. kinda.. busy leader.." answered Jomi, as she picked up her notebook.

"Oh come on, you have time, right? This week and the next week are full of celebrations, I'm sure you'll have time, since you take time with us." said Mijo, as Jomi focused on reading her schedule. "Alright, yeah. Looks like I'm free most days." responded Jomi, as she put down the notebook. Mijo pins her to the wall of the room, with sexual intentions. "Well? Why don't we start now?" asked Mijo, as Jomi trembled under his touch. "Hold on, I know you're very horny right now, but how are you this dominant? I mean, usually.. usually you'd be normal?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo took a step back.

"Good point.. Guess I just.. just am in a different headspace whenever I am horny.. Hold on, let me compose myself." answered Mijo, as he took a huge breath. "Alright, hmm.." said Mijo, as he thought about the situation, before Urda and Ikari arrived behind him. "Mijo! Jomi!" both said as Ikari put her hand at Mijo's shoulder and Urda hugged Jomi. "O—oh, hi!" said Jomi as Urda pulled back and they gathered around. 

"What were you two doing?" asked Ikari, a bit smug as Urda nodded in agreement. "Oh? We were just talking about the intramurals this school year, and the following ones in the dark world, you know, games? Hehe.." responded Jomi, shaking a bit. "Oh, ok! Well, we just wanted to say hi, and potentially get some insights on that new gamemode you're making.." responded Urda as Jomi nodded. "Look, you two, uh.. we're discussing stuff, so we'll just go to her bedroom, and talk." said Mijo, as the other two looked at each other. 

Urda looked at them confused, while Ikari was a bit shocked, before changing to a grin. "Oh, 'talk' huh? Mijo, you told me about you and Jomi before, don't lie." said Ikari, as the other two are shocked. "Mijo?! You.. you told someone else..?" exclaimed Jomi, as Urda was still confused. "Huh? What's happening?" asked Urda as Mijo was a bit disappointed but a bit smug too. "Reveal one thing about me, I reveal one thing about you." said Mijo, as Ikari widened her eyes. "Oh right. Well, let's see if you remember one, hah?" challenged Ikari, as Mijo smiled and picked one. "Well, since.. Urda, I.. uh.. fucked Jomi.. Once or twice before.. Ikari, you've told me about your desire to try to fuck Jomi to see how lesbian sex would feel." said Mijo, as the other three are shocked again.

"T—that one, huh? Well, it's.. true. But I would never, never do anything, ok? I just.. I was curious after hearing you ok..?" said Ikari, as she is shaking from embarrassment. "Man, you two are weird as fuck, guess I found the perfect friend group then." commented Urda, as she chuckled a bit. "Ikari..? I.. uh, don't know what to say.. I just.. didn't know you'd be that horny.. haha." responded Jomi, as she laughed away at the embarrassment that permeated the group.

"Well, ok! Let's.. move on! Ok, Mijo, promise me later, I'll have my turn, ok?" asked Ikari to Mijo, as Mijo looked at Jomi, and they both nodded. "Ok, we'll leave now. See ya!" said Urda before the two left. "Whew.. That.. was something." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded in agreement. "Yeah, uh.. a lot of revelations.." added Jomi, as Mijo smiled at Jomi before they walked to her bedroom.

They entered the bedroom and Jomi locked it, as they sat down on the bed. "So.." started Jomi, before Mijo brought her to stand up and pinned her to the wall. "Let's start, slave." said Mijo, as Jomi is a bit surprised by his suddenness. "S—slave? Hey.. uh.. this is only in the bedroom, right?" asked Jomi as Mijo nodded, breaking character. "Yeah, of course. I'm not this confident nor forward outside, now.. before I lose the mood, let's get back to our roles, ok?" explained Mijo, as Jomi nodded. 

"You're going to be my little slave breeder and you're going to like it." said Mijo, as he sensually touched Jomi. "R—really, master?" asked Jomi, half-confused and half-aroused. "Yes. I will plant my hot seed into you and you'll be mine. You'll birth my children, all girls ready to serve me." said Mijo, as Jomi blushed more intensely. "I—I will. Your girls will follow you in everything and will continue the.. bloodline." said Jomi as her hips buckled at his. "Good, good. Now, I shall start." said Mijo as they both took off each other's clothes.

"Mijo.. I mean.. master.. please take me.. Make me yours.. Mark me with your scent.." pleaded Jomi as Mijo nodded and started hovering his dick at her core. "M—master.. please.. take me.." continued Jomi as Mijo teased her. "Mijo! Ah.. please.. stop teasing.." said Jomi, as she arched her back and tried to get his dick inside.  Mijo responds by inserting it right there, surprising Jomi. "M—Mijo.. master.. please move.." asked Jomi as Mijo slowly started to thrust.

Jomi started to gasp and moan as Mijo slowly started to go faster, deeper and more intense at Jomi. "Mijo! Ah.. I'm close.." said Jomi as Mijo nodded and responded, "I'm about to breed you, be grateful and beg." said Mijo, as Jomi responded in-between her pleasure, "Master.. I want your seed inside me, to birth your children..!" Mijo and Jomi climaxed as Mijo spilled his seed into Jomi as she also climaxed her walls stretching and convulsing around Mijo's dick. Eventually, he pulls out, as they come down from their high, and cum drips out of Jomi.

"Holy shit.. That was intense roleplay.." commented Jomi as she felt her belly and sore pussy. "Yeah, ok.. I'm fine now.. Whew." added Mijo, as they basked in the afterglow. "Basking in the afterglow.. Hahaha.." said Mijo, as they laid down on the bed. "You're quite addicted to that AI chat roleplay, no wonder you have.. these weird preferences." said Jomi, as Mijo chuckled. "Yeah, with you though.. I'm feeling better." said Mijo as he cuddled Jomi. "Alright.. I'll let you cuddle me.. for now.." said Jomi as she embraced his touch.

Eventually, they cleaned and dressed up as they left the bedroom, still having to manage dark world responsibilities and play in the intramurals, for Jomi and Mijo respectively. Soon, Ikari and Mijo are talking as lunch break comes in, and they head to the dark world.

"Wait, you already had.. sex with Jomi as a girl? Oh, it was spontaneous, since you turned into a girl unwillingly for some reason.. Well, can you willingly turn into one?" asked Ikari to Mijo, as they walked to Jomi's castle. "I.. uh.. I think so.. Hold on, let's stop." said Mijo, before they stopped and Mijo closed his eyes and focused for a while as he grew breasts, his hair grew longer and his crotch became smaller. 

Meanwhile, Lauvielle and Urda were talking and walking before they witnessed the transformation. "Woah.. is that Mijo?" asked Urda as Lauvielle nodded. "Yep, that's him alright. I don't think Jomi dresses like that." added Lauvielle as Mijo finished transforming, now basically looking like Jomi, except for the clothes. 

"Woah.. this is.. still interesting to feel.." said Mijo as Ikari looks visibly attracted but looks away. "Fuck, dude. You look so.. beautiful. Just, like that? Yeah, I'm.. I'm not that normal right now.. Haha, you know.." said Ikari, as she noticed the other two. "Oh, we should go. Urda and.. Lauvielle are here, I know Urda knows.. But that doesn't help with my.. shame, haha.." said Ikari, as she dragged Mijo with her to Jomi's castle quickly.

Once they get inside they immediately go to Ikari's bedroom in the castle as Ikari locks it. "I.. shit, shit.. I can't.. just.. fuck you.. man.. Can you get Jomi in here? Please?" asked Ikari, as Mijo nodded and unlocked the door. He went outside and searched for Jomi, first going to her bedroom. "Jomi..?" asked Mijo, as the door opens and Jomi is there, wearing a towel cover. "M—Mijo? Oh.. you're in your girl form.. Um, s—sorry.. I was busy.. playing with myself.."  said Jomi, very embarrassed. "O—oh.. speaking of that, Ikari's nearby, so.. yeah about earlier.." said Mijo, before Jomi nodded and got her clothes. 

Then after dressing up again, Mijo and Jomi went to Ikari's bedroom and Jomi locked it as Ikari was taking off her clothes. "Oh.. she's.. ok, Mijo, what.. what does she want?" asked Jomi as Ikari noticed the two and was super embarrassed. "Ah! You.. ah.. just.. mmm.. Jomi, I've heard you're.. good at.. these.. experiences.. So, I thought why don't you show me, it?" asked Ikari, as Jomi looked at Mijo with a chuckle. "Oh, um.. sure. What.. do you want to be? Sub, or dom? Because, me and Mijo share this.. interest in power dynamics." asked Jomi, as Ikari was flustered by Jomi's question. "I like both.. but since I'm just.. starting out.. I can sub.." said Ikari, preparing herself for Jomi's touch.

"O—ok.. This one is for you two, I'm going to transform and leave—" said Mijo before Jomi stops her. "No, stay. I want you to.. watch." said Jomi as Ikari is even more flustered. "Ah.. fuck.. y—yes.. stay.." said Ikari as she looked at the two, very aroused. "Ok.. ok.. Well, I'll see then." responded Mijo as he sat down on a nearby chair as Jomi approached Ikari, now with a more dominant streak. "Ikari~" purred Jomi as she approached Ikari.

"Jomi.." responded Ikari as Jomi grabbed her and put herself on top. "Ikari, be a good girl and let me take over, ok?" said Jomi as Ikari nodded, and Jomi took off Ikari's bra and started to touch her erect nipples. Ikari instantly gasps at this touch as she puts her hands at Jomi's own. Jomi grins as she suckles on Ikari's nipples, sending shockwaves of pleasure at Ikari. "J—Jomi.. Jomi!" said Ikari as she started to tremble a bit as she got closer. "Ah.. Jomi.. I'm.. I'm close.." said Ikari as Jomi inserted her fingers to Ikari's core. "Jomi!! AHHH!" screamed Ikari as she came undone as Jomi moved inside of her.

They rode out the wave as Jomi pulled out and she started to grind at Ikari's core, sending them both into more pleasure. "J—Jomi..! Ah.. It's too much.. ah.." said Ikari, as she is still convulsing from her aftershock. "It.. gets better, trust..!" said Jomi as they climaxed again, their juices mixing. "Agh.. Jomi.. again.. ah.." said Ikari, as she is breathing heavily. "Sure, remember I am your.. master, hmm?" said Jomi as she teased Ikari. "Master..? I.. um.. don't.. ah!" responded Ikari before Jomi kissed her. The kiss got deeper as Jomi dominated it, Ikari accepting as she pulled back, leaving Ikari panting.

"Jomi.. more.." said Ikari, as Jomi eyes lightened up and she kissed Ikari as she touched her core. Ikari is heard softly moaning into the kiss as her hands wander to Jomi's breasts, itching to also touch them. Jomi pulls back, and directs Ikari to touch her. As soon as Ikari did, Jomi felt a sense of pleasure that was submissive. "Ah.. whew.." said Jomi as she softly moaned at Ikari's touch. "Am I... doing it right?" asked Ikari as Jomi nodded and she continued her movements on Ikari. Both women touched each other in their intimate areas, as they got closer and closer to another climax. 

"Jomi..! I'm close.. so.. close.." exclaimed Ikari, as Jomi ramped up her efforts. "I'm close too, dear." said Jomi as Ikari also ramped up her touches, eventually causing them to orgasm violently. Both scream out of pure ecstasy and pleasure as Jomi lies down on Ikari, both feeling boneless and limp after their intense fucking. Meanwhile, Mijo the entire time was also silent touching herself, and she was on the floor, also dripping with her liquids from her high when she was watching the other two.

After a while of basking in the afterglow, Mijo stands up, a bit flustered as the other two are still at the bed, with each other. "So.. I'm just.. going to.. uh.. leave? Wait no, help." said Mijo, as the other two separated from each other. "Yeah.. help me clean.. Ikari..?" asked Jomi, as Ikari is looking down, a bit glazed over. "O—oh..? Um, sure.." said Ikari as she looked up, and stood up from the bed. Together they cleaned up the room, and Mijo first went into the shower. As she was showering, the other two were busy with continuing the cleaning.

"How was... the experience, Ikari?" asked Jomi as she was doing some magic to dry the mattresses and sheets wet with their liquids. "Ermm... I think it's.. different, and interesting. This.. ermm.. only confirmed my sexuality for me." answered Ikari, as Jomi nodded. "Alright. Understandable." responded Jomi, as Mijo finished and they also finished cleaning. "Um.. I'll be on my way soon." said Mijo as the other two nodded.

They eventually left, having other stuff to do, as typical of the Dark Pearl. Jomi and Mijo head off to prepare more stuff for the Dark Intramurals, while Ikari goes to chat with Lauvielle and Urda. Hours later, Mijo is chilling at the balcony of their school, as Rhida comes up to him.

"Hey! I'm done." said Rhida, as Mijo turned to her. "Oh? Cool. What now?" asked Mijo, as Rhida grabbed his arm and they walked to the entrance of the dark world. They jumped in and walked to Jomi's castle, as Jomi is speaking with Urda nearby.

"So have you finished the art and music for the project?" asked Jomi, as Urda shook her head. "No.. I managed to sneak some work in earlier but this is about half done. Sorry.." answered Urda as Mijo and Rhida passed by them. "Hmm.. That's unfortunate. Rhida, what's your project situation with Jomi?" asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about it as they continued to walk away from the other two. "It's going good.. But we aren't done either.. There's just been too much pressure these past few weeks.." answered Rhida as they arrived at Jomi's castle. 

They entered the castle as Mijo responded, "That's unfortunate. I am guessing we're delaying for a while.. Oh well, it's nothing. Next week's probably a break due to Halloween.. anyway, where are we going?" before they arrive at Rhida's room in the castle. "You want to get something? Go ahead, I'll wait.." said Mijo, before Rhida looked at him, blushing. "Mijo.. I have.. an idea.. But first, let's just enter my room, ok?" said Rhida, before Rhida unlocked the door and they both entered as Rhida closed it. "Mijo.. I want to try.. bondage.." admitted Rhida, as Mijo was flustered and took a step back. 

"What..? Really..?" questioned Mijo, as Rhida ran to Mijo and buried her head on his chest. "Mijo.. I thought you said no judgement when in the bedroom.." said Rhida, her voice muffled and trembling. I.. no— no! I.. just.. I was surprised.. I did not mean to.. to.. I'm sorry, Rhida.." said Mijo, as he comforted her. "Mijo.. I built my confidence up just to ask you this... and..." continued Rhida, before she broke down in tears. "I.. I'm sorry.." said Mijo, softly as he continued to comfort her by patting her back. After a while, Rhida's sobs subsided as she pulled back.

"I.. I am sorry for crying this much.. I.. know it was.. was.. just.. a mistake but.. I'm just so on edge.. right now.. So sorry.. you have to deal with me.." said Rhida, before Mijo walked to her and held her hand. "It's fine.. I.. I'm just grateful you're this comfortable with me." said Mijo reassuringly before Rhida nodded. "Ok.. ok.. Um.. back.. to the topic.." said Rhida, as she walked to a nearby cabinet. She searched through it, bringing out some silky cuffs and ties, as well as whips, vibrators and more. "Getting into it.. huh?" said Mijo before Rhida closed the cabinet and brought the items to the bed.

"I.. uh.. in my free time.. at home, I was curious  what you told me about.. BDSM.. so.. I decided to.. ahem.. research? About it.. and.. I had a very fun night then.. So, I wanted to try this with you, if you want.." explained Rhida, as Mijo inspected the items that Rhida brought. "Interesting, how did you get this?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and looked at Mijo, with an awkward smile. "Jomi.. she.. uh.. had some.." Mijo chuckled and got one of the vibrators to test its capabilities. "Mmm.. seems good. Ahaha.. I would know." said Mijo, as he put the vibrator down.

"Hey.. uh.. so.. can.. we.. start?" asked Rhida, as Mijo brought the items to the floor nearby. "Sure. What.. role do you want to be?" questioned Mijo, as Rhida blushes and looks at the items on the floor. "You know me.. just.. um.." responded Rhida, as her blush and embarrassment intensified. "D—do I have to say it..?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with pleading eyes. "Yes.. I can guess, but you have to say it.." answered Mijo, as Rhida looked at the items then to Mijo. "Okay.. I.. want to.. sub.." answered Rhida, before Mijo nodded with a grin. "Cool, I'll dom then." said Mijo, as he grabbed the silky cuffs and ties.

"So.. should I.. undress?" asked Rhida, as she looked at the cuffs Mijo got. "Yeah. I'll guide you, don't worry." answered Mijo, before Rhida started undressing herself. She started with her dress, then her undershirt, her shorts, then her bra, and her panty. Mijo was looking at the other items and organizing them for later use while she did it. "Mijo.. I'm done.." said Rhida, as Mijo looked at her and her naked body. "Oh.. ahem. Right. Let's tie you up then. You know safe words, right? Mine is banana." said Mijo, as he felt a faint blush on his cheeks while he directed Rhida to the bed.

"O—ok.." said Rhida as she laid down on the bed and spread her arms and legs. Mijo gently used the cuffs on her arms, then the ties on her legs. Rhida tested the restraints, and looked at Mijo. "I.. trust you.." said Rhida, as Mijo nodded and smiled. "From this word, I'll be in roleplay mode, same with you, ok?" said Mijo, as Rhida nodded. "Yeah.. okay.." said Rhida, before Mijo grabbed a flogger that he noticed in the collection that Rhida took out. He gently caressed it on her skin, building anticipation.

Soon enough, he used it on her, making Rhida gasp and scream in combined pain and pleasure. "M—more.." said Rhida, as Mijo continued his flogging on Rhida. Rhida is shaking as the flogging is almost overwhelming her with pain and pleasure. Mijo stops after a while, looking at Rhida intensely. "N—no.. why stop.." asked Rhida as she looked at Mijo back. "Just checking, love." said Mijo, before he put the flog down and started to touch her breasts instead while fingering her core.

"Ah.. b—back to.. b—basics.. ah.." said Rhida, as she is touched by Mijo in all her pleasurable spots, gasping and moaning while doing so. "An appetizer. Don't come yet." responded Mijo, as he covered her mouth with his right hand while continuing to pleasure Rhida with the other. Rhida muffled moans continued, as her hands and feet involuntarily convulsed due to her intense pleasure, her eyes glazed over at Mijo, lost in her sensations.

Mijo pulled back just before Rhida could climax, leaving her panting and wanting for more. "Mijo! Please.. continue.. can't.. stay.. like this.." pleaded Rhida as she is at the brink, panting very heavily. "Hmm.." said Mijo, as he inspected her face, then her body. Rhida is looking at him, very flustered as Mijo pulls back and gets a whip. Mijo looked at Rhida, before untying her. "Turn around. Turn your back to me." ordered Mijo, as Rhida nodded and turned around in compliance. "I.. I think I've seen this.. before.." commented Rhida, before Mijo's whip traces along her spine, up and down, getting firmer by each cycle. 

"Mijo.. just.. hit me already.." begged Rhida, as she turned around to face Mijo. Mijo went closer and touched her cheek, as he directed his other hand to trace the whip behind her. "You're begging for it, aren't you.. My little lovely slutty slave." whispered Mijo, as Rhida was a bit surprised by what he said, but also very aroused. "Y—yes.. I am.. yours.." said Rhida, before turning back around. Mijo pulled back and teased her one more time with the whip before finally using it, hitting her back. Rhida let out a yelp of mixed pain and pleasure, as Mijo went to town on her back and ass, intensifying and overwhelming her with intense pain and pleasure before Mijo stopped as Rhida fell to her back on the bed, convulsing from pleasure.

"Ah.. Mijo.. mijo.." said Rhida, as she barely held in her climax. "Final." said Mijo, as he fully undressed. "Mijo.." said Rhida, as Mijo approaches Rhida with his hard dick. "Agh.. Mijo.." said Rhida, as she spread her legs for him before he jumped on the bed. "Rhida, look at how you're ready for me, now.. don't come yet." said Mijo, as he teased her wet pussy with his dick, making her arch her back and involuntarily grind her core to his manhood. "Mijo.. so.. close.." said Rhida, looking at Mijo with a very flustered face.

Mijo thrust into her, making her scream in pleasure as she takes her roughly. "Mijo! I.. didn't know this... side.. of you.." said Rhida, in-between her moans of satisfaction. "Mhm. Do you like it?" asked Mijo, as he pulls out and turns her to make her face him. "I.. do.." admitted Rhida, before Mijo inserted into her again, thrusting hard and deep. "Ah! Mijo! I'm close.. please.. please.." said Rhida, as she is pounded intensely by Mijo. "Go ahead." ordered Mijo, as Rhida was allowed to violently orgasm. At the same time, Mijo also came as Rhida's walls clamped down on his cock, milking him out of all his cum, as the liquid filled Rhida's womb.

Eventually, Mijo pulled out, as Rhida came down from her high. Cum spills out from her pussy, as they both lay on the bed. "Oh my god... Mijo.. mmnnn.. I can feel.. it.. inside." said Rhida, as she turned to face him. "Ahaha.. Intense right?" commented Mijo, as he rubbed her belly. "Ah.. yeah.. whew.. I.. need a moment to rest.. can you.. cuddle me please..?" said Rhida, as she held Mijo's hand on her belly. "Of course. We'll clean up later."

They cuddle for a while, before Rhida decides to go out of the bed and into the shower while Mijo puts away the things and cleans the bedroom. After Rhida finishes, they switch and Mijo is in the shower while Rhida finishes his work. They nod to each other as they dress up fully and leave Rhida's room, satisfied and content.

## Author's Note:

Well, that's done. That's where I'm going to stop the horniness for this one. Because, well.. I just.. need different scenarios. Oh, and also because I've explored well enough during the vacation to understand this a lot more, anyways, see you, and hopefully.. you enjoyed it, ehe~

<!--Cara character development ehehe oh and tentacles for (sexy) time-->
<p id="S7"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Tentacles for the Tentacled</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Cara and the abyss doctor have a new experiment and Cara decides to test it out in the dark world, beginning with her old little plaything, Jomi.

## Author's Note:

Well, this is a weird chapter. This is mainly because of the.. ahem. Scenes of certain anime that were very horrifying but you know.. arousing.. So, I wanted to make my own. Get it out of my system.

Not even my preference, but it was in the category.. and I watched it.. So, ahem. Anyways, no plot here. Maybe a little bit of characterization, but yeah.. expecting the plot to make sense in.. smut is.. well, good luck!

WARNING: Sexual content, with tentacles

— jmb~

---

Jomi wakes up in a daze, she is naked as she is tied up by some purple tentacles in bed as Cara watches over her with a sinister gaze.

"C—Cara! H—how.. did you get.. these.." asked Jomi as Cara approached her, seemingly in control of these tentacles. "Hmm.. An experiment of the doctor and me.. And I know the perfect first subject, you." said Cara as she caresses Jomi's cheek. "M—me..? I.. um.." stuttered Jomi as Cara caressed her chest, brushing alongside her breasts. "I know you can take it.. You've done so much for me, so.. this is just another one of it, ehehe.." responded Cara as she touched the tentacles making them move to Jomi's thigh.

"W—what.. Cara.. what are they.. no.. ah..." said Jomi as she squirmed due to the insistent movement of the tentacles. "They're taking you to new heights, of course. You're getting impregnated too, so be prepared." answered Cara as the first tentacle slipped into Jomi's wetness. Jomi felt her body's involuntary response, gasping and trying to arch her back as the alien appendage penetrated into her. "Ah.. s—stop themm... please.." begged Jomi as the tentacle thrust into Jomi, the movement both horrifying and mesmerizing. Jomi felt her body adjust to the foreign intrusion, as she moaned in pure pleasure.

"Oh I love that face.." whispered Cara to Jomi, as she stroked Jomi's hair, seeing her blush and intense arousal. "Just like before, mmm... Can't wait for you to be mine again."

Jomi bit her lip as another tentacle joined the first, filling her completely. The sensations were overwhelming, a combination of pain and pleasure that danced along her nerves. She could feel herself getting wetter and wetter with each stroke, her body betraying her fearful thoughts. But she couldn't stop her cries from coming out, as the tentacles continued to work in unison. She begins to feel that familiar feeling of being filled, invaded and used that she always had with Cara before as her body sang for more, but her mind was trying to shut out with the depravity and trauma of the event.

"C—Cara.. t—too much.. please.. let me.. come.." begged Jomi, as Cara put her index finger at Jomi's mouth. "Shh.. It'll be fine.. You'll know when." whispered Cara before she pulled away and looked at the tentacles, glazed over with intense hunger like the tentacles. As the sensations continued, Jomi could feel the tentacles and her coming closer to climax, as thoughts of impregnation clouded her mind. Her orgasm builds, as the crescendo seems to never end, pushing her to her absolute limit.

As the tentacles reached their climax, Jomi felt a warm rush fill her up, a feeling that was very well known to her. It was as if her very soul was once again claimed by Cara, with these tentacles. Her body convulsed and arched as she came, the tentacles releasing their load deep inside her.

"Look at you. ahaha... Such a good breeder for these little tentacles of mine." commented Cara, with pride and awe. "Ah.. W—what now..?" asked Jomi, as she panted, with her eyes glazed over with shock and pleasure. "Now.. we wait, of course. Don't worry, you're special.. I'll wait for you to rest, then.. we test the lightners." answered Cara, as she traced Jomi's swollen belly.

The room grew quiet as the tentacles slowly retracted, their purple forms slipping away into the shadows. Jomi lay there, panting and trembling, her body still singing with the aftershocks of the most intense orgasm she felt in a while. Jomi is recovering as Cara stroked the tentacles, seemingly controlled by her as they retracted more into the dark. "Y—you plan to.. fuck the lightners..? A—all of them?" asked Jomi as Cara helped her sit up on the bed.

"Yeah, hmm.. I hear that Mijo is a special example, he can transform to both female and male, right? Because of that potion of yours.. ahaha..! She'll be a.. great subject. As for the other males, I'll have to use the same method you did, but way more corrupting.. You already know what happens to their females though, ahahaha.." explained Cara as she smiled wickedly at Jomi, with her feeling scared but unable to run away. "O—ok.. I have no choice.." said Jomi as Cara traced her belly again, slowly retracting to normal size, as cum spilled out.

"Mmm.. you're lucky I am in control, if these.. little beings were left to their own devices? You'll be stuck, tied up in the air, birthing forever their new spawns. But, I'm more than that. We actually don't have those tentacles, since I control them, and any excess is killed off." continued Cara, as Jomi imagines what that would be and hyperventilates. Cara patted Jomi's back and made Jomi look at her. "Like I said, it won't happen. I'm in control. Now, let's get you dressed up in your best.. royal clothes. Dress, and all. Come on, Me? I'm just going to use your wardrobe." responded Cara as she went to Jomi's wardrobe and picked out a nightgown and gave Jomi some royal ball clothes.

They wore them, as Cara looked at herself in the mirror, reminiscent of olden days. "Uh.. so.. am I still pregnant..?" trembled Jomi as she checked her clothes and was also brushing her hair. "Yes. Mmmm.. You want to give birth here? Ok." answered Cara as she went up to Jomi and rubbed her belly as a small egg came out of her pussy. Cara took the egg and quickly cracked it as tentacles came out, her controlled tentacles quickly took the egg and the small tentacle to be developed as they went back into the shadows. Meanwhile Jomi is frozen in place, still processing the horrifying event that just took place.

"Get that out of the way.. Mmm.. Jomi? Come on.." said Cara as she snapped her fingers bringing Jomi back to reality, as she started to hyperventilate. "W—what happened.. what was that.. what.. what.." repeated Jomi, as she instinctively buried her head to Cara's shoulders. "Ah? Mmm.. Come on, Jomi.." said Cara as she was surprised by this, her emotions mixed. "Agh! No.. why.. do I feel empathy... fuck.. No.. no.." murmured Cara as she patted Jomi's back as she cried. "Damn it.. ok, Jomi..? I'll let you.. release your emotions as part of our plan to dominate the dark world." whispered Cara to Jomi, as she murmured in acknowledgement.

After a while, Jomi pulled back. "Cara? How.. did you.. let me..? This isn't you.. Y—you would taunt me further.. and.. degrade me.. but.. huh?" questioned Jomi, as Cara looked at her, unsure of herself anymore. "One time thing. Promise it won't happen again.. I think..?" said Cara as she looked at Jomi's confused yet grateful expression. "No.. no.. it's something else. You're changing too." continued Jomi, as Cara looked down and took a deep breath. "Ah.. whatever. The plan is still ongoing.. I mean, ehehe.. does it matter if I have different feelings about it, when the effect is the same?" asked Cara as she looked at Jomi, with a grin.

"Well, yeah.. But, now you're conflicted about it. Like me before.. you know what happened. Your plan failed at the last second." said Jomi, as Cara looked down again, feeling anger but also confusion. "Right. I've always.. punished you for that. But, this.. feeling? Empathy? You call it? It hit me suddenly, foreign.. and not.. normal." answered Cara before she stood up and grabbed Jomi. "We're going. I don't want to talk about it. I'm the one with the tentacles. So, let's go." continued Cara, before dragging her outside of her bedroom where they were before.

"Do you even know where Mijo is?" asked Jomi as Cara stopped in her tracks. "No. Provide it." said Cara glaring at Jomi. "Ah! I.. uh.. um.. hold on.. let me.." said Jomi before Cara forcefully pressed Jomi to her body with tentacles behind Jomi. "Tell me now. Or else." said Cara as tentacles go closer to Jomi. "Hold on! Hold on.. please.. I'm.. begging you.. I.. just need.. to.. think.." responded Jomi, her tears swelling again. "Think faster." said Cara as she takes one of the tentacles and presses it at Jomi's pussy through her panty. "Ah! Please.. please.. you've.. done to me so much.. Y—you're already my.. master.. so... why don't you drop me.. then.. I can direct you to Mijo..? Please..? Just.. I will.. do anything.. just.. don't do that to me again.." begged Jomi, saying anything to get out of the impending assault.

"Fine." said Cara as she drops Jomi and the tentacles retract. "T—thank you.." said Jomi softly as she pants due to the tension of the situation. "See? I don't have empathy, so that empathy was a one time thing." said Cara, as Jomi looked down before hugging Cara. "Agh! No no.. Not again.. no. You.." said Cara as she tried to get Jomi off, but it was weak, she couldn't use her tentacles nor her abyss magic. "Cara.. cara..." repeated Jomi to Cara, as she buried her head to Cara's shoulder. "What..? Stop.. using this stupid empathy to make me do stuff I don't usually do." responded Cara, as Jomi pulled back and looked at her, exhaustion catching up. "Like you do every waking second we meet?" asked Jomi, as Cara nodded insistently.

"Yes. That's my role. Let's.. just go." said Cara as she glared at Jomi. "O—ok! I—I know where he is.. F—follow.." said Jomi, as she walked and Cara followed. They were walking to the outside of Jomi's castle, as Cara reminisced about the castle, seeing the stuff that Jomi changed when she gave it to her. Eventually, they got to the outside and walked to the city, as everyone recognized Jomi but not Cara. They eventually found Mijo, with Rhida chatting normally.

"H—here.. we are. I—if you can.. please don't disturb the others..? I.. I can bring them to the castle." said Jomi, as they looked at the two, drinking and eating. "Hmph. Don't tell me what to do." responded Cara as she walked up to the two and simply grabbed them with tentacles then quickly left for Jomi's castle as Jomi tried to catch up with Cara.

Around them, the people around were confused but with Jomi around, they decided to ignore it, maybe they're a new lightner, or some darkner from another world, they don't know. They don't see Cara carrying Mijo and Rhida, since Cara intentionally hidden their faces. After a lot of running, they arrive at the castle and Cara goes into one of the many rooms of the castle, coincidentally being Mijo's room in the castle for his temporary respite. Jomi quickly follows inside, fearing the worse for the two.

"Cara! I.. didn't know you would do this.." said Jomi as Cara laid down the two in bed, their clothes completely removed as Jomi is suddenly thrown their clothes. "Keep them safe." said Cara, as Jomi hesitantly nods and puts them nearby. "H—hey! Jomi? And who is this?!!" said Mijo, as Jomi's face became worried. "C—Cara.." answered Jomi, as Mijo and Rhida widened their eyes. "Cara.. huh.." said Mijo as he looked at Cara more clearly. "Mijo.. we're going to die.. These tentacles.." said Rhida, as Mijo quickly nodded, pretty worried. "I know.. I know.." said Mijo as they increasingly became worried, knowing they can't run away from Cara.

"Let's get the normal woman out of the way." said Cara as she used the tentacles to tie Rhida up to the bed as Mijo was knocked back, watching in horror. "Ah! Help! Mijo..! Jomi!" screamed Rhida, as a tentacle was inserted into Rhida's wetness as the other tentacles were on her breasts. "I can't watch.. Jomi... help us.. I can't use my magic.." said Mijo to Cara as Jomi looked at Rhida and Cara, concerned.

"I—I'm sorry.. But Cara already took my magic too.. I can barely.. use anything.. I'm so sorry.. But, until she's done.. You're enduring it all.. It has.. pregnancy too.." said Jomi, as Mijo nods in acknowledgement. "Then.. I know this is stupid.. But can we convince Cara to.. give up y'know.." asked Mijo, as Rhida was pleased by tentacles right in front of them. "Ah!! Coming!!" screamed Rhida as she orgasmed and the tentacles dumped their load into Rhida. "Fuck.. ah.. this cum is.. stretching me.. I'm so sorry.. Mijo.." whimpered Rhida as she was untied. Liquids poured out of her core as she was exhausted by Cara, making her limp on the bed.

"Next, the interesting one. Mijo!" said Cara as she grabbed Mijo by his legs and positioned him on the bed, with his legs spread out and his dick in view. Rhida is pushed aside as Jomi comes to her. "W—what..? Interesting?!! That would be.. um.. good but.. with you? That's not a good word." said Mijo before the tentacles started wrapping his dick. "I wonder.. what you'll do.. Come on, Mijo.. This is much more enjoyable as a female.. So, do it.. I promise it'll be rough~ Ehehe.." responded Cara as she looked at his eyes, with excitement and hunger. "Oh no.. I.. don't know.. either way I get raped right?" asked Mijo, as Cara slid over one of the tentacles to touch the tip of his dick sending him spiraling. "Well.. if you see it that way. I'm just curious what you would do, ahaha..!" answered Cara as she jumped on the bed and positioned one of the tentacles near his anal. "Oh gosh.. Don't.. please.. don't.. I.. haven't been.. fucked there.." said Mijo as he felt the tentacles slide into his ass. "Ahhh!??" said Mijo as he came and the tentacles absorbed his cum as he began the transition to his female form.

"No.. no.. not again.. please.. stop.." said Mijo as her voice started to change, her breasts started to appear and his dick slowly transformed into a vagina. "Oh? You transition like this? Or is this your own choice?" asked Cara as Mijo shook his head. "Ah.. why do you care... if it's my choice.. you forced me here anyway.." said Mijo, in-between gasps and moans as the tentacles adjusted to her new form, quickly teasing Mijo's core and breasts as the tentacle in her ass continued to thrust. "Hmm. So.. it isn't.. Is this the only catalyst.. or is this just one of the reasons.. Interesting, Jomi, any insights?" said Cara, as Jomi was frozen again and turned to face Cara. "I.. uh.. M—Mijo..? What should I do..?" asked Jomi as she was trembling, she didn't want to hurt her friends again. "Jomi.. I... fudge.. this.. ah.. give her what she wants.." answered Mijo in-between her own gasps and moans as she is penetrated into both of her bottom holes. "O—ok.. Um... Mijo.. she can willingly change forms, however under heavy arousal, haziness or vulnerability, if she can't control it, she'll transform into a girl until she returns to normal.." said Mijo, trembling in her speech as she looked at Mijo, still being fucked.

"Oh.. I see." said Cara as she looked at Mijo more clearly. "Come for me. Mijo." cooed Cara as the tentacles dumped their load into Mijo, filling her up entirely. She orgasmed too, mixing fluids as her belly is swollen with tentacle cum as it pulled out. "Ah.. no.." said Mijo as she looked at her body, wet and filled with cum. Cara's tentacles retracted as she jumped off the bed and looked at Rhida and Jomi. "Rhida.. it's going to be fine.. Just.. push it out.." said Jomi, as she held Rhida by her hand and back as she also births a tentacle egg as one tentacle takes it and disappears again. "Is this.. what you wanted..? Are you happy.. or satisfied?" asked Jomi as she looked at Cars, defeated. "Mmm.. Ha—" Cara stopped herself, usually she would've said satisfied or happy in their misery, but she can't bring herself to say it for some reason. "Mmm.. No.. I.. don't. Fuck.. stupid stupid empathy.. Why.." said Cara as tears flowed from her eyes. "What..? The fuck is this? Wetness in my eyes? Blurred vision.." continued Cara as she fell to her knees.

"Cara..? I.. I am the only one who can.. care about this.. I'm sure your abyss subjects won't like their queen crying because of what she does daily and the lightners around me are too shocked and angry to care about you.. Me? You.. were with me for a long time.. So, I know you." said Jomi as she patted Cara's back before Cara shook her away. "SHUT UP." said Cara as she looked at Jomi with anger and confused eyes, as tentacles appeared behind her ready to be used on Jomi. "Ah! N—no.. O—ok.. I.. please.. don't use them..." responded Jomi as her breathing hitched and she started to quicken her breaths. "Ah.. what is this.. am I..? Oh gosh.. it's so.. painful.. Jomi.. help.." said Mijo as she started to birth the tentacle's egg. "I.. ok!" said Jomi as she quickly stood up and went to Mijo's side, comforting her. "You'll be fine.. Just.. let it happen.. I.. Push it out, you can do it, I'll be here.." said Jomi to Mijo, as she pushed out the tentacle egg that Cara's tentacle soon took and brought back to the shadows.

"Damn it.. I.. can't be feeling like this.. Not in front of these.. these.. lowly.. no.. people.. fuck.." thought Cara as she looked at Mijo and Jomi. She felt Rhida move to Mijo's side, as they comforted each other as Jomi looked at Cara and went up to her. "Cara?" asked Jomi, as Cara looked at her, trying to look stern but her face still looked confused. "I.. I can help you, let me.. let me..." said Jomi as she tried to use her magic. "Huh? Hey!" said Cara as she realized her guard was down, making Jomi regain her magic. Jomi blasted some purple and dark blue light at Cara, as she felt hazy and fell asleep.

Jomi enters Cara's dream, feeling unsure if she's going to be abused there or not but she decides to walk further since she already was there. She sees Cara's new body and the abyss doctor.

"Ugh.. what the fuck.." said Cara as she woke up and saw the abyss doctor. "Hello. You may call me the doctor. The abyss doctor. Hmm.. or a name for myself, I say.. Racsa. Hm. But keep that to yourself, call me the doctor, abyss doctor but not my name. Agreed?" said Rasca as Cara nodded. "Ok... fine. You deserve that after you.. what did you do? How did you..?" asked Cara as Rasca looked at her and laughed. "I just.. took you in. You lost, remember? Haha.. Now, we're equals." answered Rasca as Cara stood up from the bed she was laid on. "Equals? Psh. You.. control my life basically. I know this, very well. So, what is it now, hm?" said Cara as Rasca got some pills and gave her it, it's colored dark purple on the right side and dark purple on the left side. "Is this.. what the fuck is this?" asked Cara as Rasca looked at her, observant. "It's a pill. Take it. Or not." said Rasca as she left her inside the room. "I have no choice.. huh? Haha.. what a cruel fate.. Being reduced to Jomi's level, while she becomes the dark princess of her kingdom? Haha.. Well, I guess I'll have to take her as soon as possible." said Cara as the dream transitioned.

"Huh? I.. this makes sense. I always wondered what her relation was with the doctor.. I'm guessing because.. she always appeared instead of him. She leads the assault while the doctor defends and hides in the shadows. Ok, this.. hmm.." said Jomi as she went to the next phase of the dream.

"Wow.. these tentacles you made.. hahaha.. Can't wait to use 'em." said Cara as Rasca nodded in agreement. "Mhm. They're good. Now, I made them so that you can further use your own powers, manifested as these slimy and potentially sexual tentacles. Now, any eggs that are produced should be kept, we want to make sure they don't affect us, lest we get attached by our own creation." continued Rasca as Cara nodded in acknowledgement. "Okay, I'll do that, thanks doc." said Cara before Rasca left to go do something else.

"Wow.. wait.. the doctor's a.. girl?!! No fucking way.. What?!" said Jomi as Cara inspected her new tentacles. "Hmm.. I don't know why that doctor has transformation powers.. Hmm, maybe.. Huh, I heard that Mijo can transform, I should go to him after I visit my good old slave, Jomi." said Cara to herself, as she looked around and the dream transitioned again. "Huh? Transformation..? What.. uh.. I.. ok.. I guess that's why I can't pinpoint him.. or her? What is his true form anymore..?" asked Jomi before she walked to the next phase of the dream.

"Haha.. hey who's there?" asked Cara as she looked at Jomi, with a bit of a smile. "Ah.. no.. Um, it's me.. Jomi. I just wanted to.. talk. I.. please don't do anything.. ok?" responded Jomi, before Cara approached her and pinned her to a wall she conjured. "Talk? Hm, better yet.. what are you doing here?" questioned Cara as she breathes down Jomi. "I.. swear.. I just wanted to talk.. Be honest, do you feel.. empathy?" asked Jomi as Cara widened her eyes and pulled back. "Huh? Haha.. I don't even know what that means.. Hehe.." responded Cara as she looked around frantically. "Y—you look like you do.." commented Jomi, as Cara tried to speak, but couldn't say anything to retort to Jomi. "Haha.. So? Does it fucking matter? Huh? Tell me, slave. Does it mater if I feel bad, regret, or guilt if I keep doing it? Because.. you keep going at me like a cancer. So, you have the answer, slave?" questioned Cara as she manifests some dark cloud that seemed to instill fear into Jomi, but she stood her ground.

"I.. yes. At least.. you won't do it again, right?" asked Jomi, as Cara's cloud dissapates. "Haha.. I live for this. You know what, I've always been honest. A honest motherfucker who takes pride in your suffering. So let me tell you this, you think I can do anything else?" questioned Cara, now basically centimeters away from Jomi. "Uh.. um.. I guess.. but.. I don't know, ok? I don't know everything, neither do you. I just wished you'd stop. Stop abusing us.. Stop.. using us as objects of your pleasure.. Stop... the pain.. I.. can't do this any longer.. Just.. kill yourself.." responded Jomi as Cara quickly wrapped rope around her neck, choking her as Cara grins. "Say it again. I'll kill you. And you won't survive being in this body." threatened Cara, as Jomi widened her eyes and shook her head then splurted out, "Let me go! I'm sorry! Sorry!!?" Cara let her go, before Jomi was dropped to her knees and started to breathe heavily. "Sorry..? You just told me, you'd prefer me dead. Now, no one's hear that no?" continued Cara, before Jomi stood up again. "I.. am truly sorry.. I just.. can't stop myself anymore. You're.. you understand right? Hatred.. anger.. that's what I felt. I.. just.. don't want to hurt anymore.. Please.. you.. get me.. r—right? Please?" responded Jomi, as she hugged Cara, making her drop her manifested rope.

Cara felt strained when she was hugged, she didn't want to feel this and yet, as it settled, she felt empathy rise again. Her breathing grew heavier, as she looked around her then at Jomi. "Must be the new body.. I guess.. I can't.. prevent it anyway.. My abyss magic can only hinder this.. for so long.. Jomi, pull back." said Cara as Jomi complied. 

"Ok, whew.. Look, I.. I am not the same anymore. I know you know that, I just wanted you to hear it. This new body and purpose has been exhausting.. Do I even feel anything, happiness through pain? Mmm.. It's nothing. I gathered enough anyway, I got what I wanted in the end. Haha.. after all this time, I still developed.. well.. this is.. either way the beginning. Leave now." said Cara as the dream finished and Jomi woke up in a daze.

Jomi saw Mijo, now back to his male form, and Rhida tying down Cara to the bed, not to degrade her but to prevent her from hurting them as they are both dressed up again. "Jomi! You woke up.. um.. what did you do?" asked Mijo, as Jomi stirred awake and stood up from her bed. "I.. nevermind. What are you doing to her?" asked Jomi as Mijo looked at Rhida and at the Cara stirring awake. "Tying her up until you wake up. Now you did, I gotta ask what we should do with her.. She's dangerous to you, me and everyone else." answered Mijo, as they walked to Cara, with an unreadable expression.

"Haha.. you lightners.. This is nothing. Leave this room. Let me speak to Jomi only. Or else." said Cara as she looked at Mijo and Rhida. "Hmm.. we should.. yeah. If you need help, we'll be outside, and scream for help if Cara attacks you ok? Rhida, let's go." said Mijo, as he realized provoking Cara wouldn't be beneficial so he and Rhida left.

"So.. what now?" asked Jomi as Cara felt the restraints. "I will go back to the doctor. I.. still have to give.. haha.. well.. her, the results. Hmmm.. right now.. I feel confused.. and.. not normal. But.. I also feel powerless.. Weird.. I.. never felt this way before. These foreign human emotions.. I have to figure it out. You want to know our plans? We're just chillin' waiting for something to happen. The doctor hasn't told me what, but I.. well.. I have no choice but to trust.. her." answered Cara, before she gestured Jomi to untie her. "Should I.. reveal this? Honest question, because.. I kinda.. I'm sorry by the way, for intruding on your memories.. But, it's.. it's just.. part of the process.." asked Jomi, as Cara laughs while Jomi unties her.

 "Well, you can do it.. what does that change? Oh no, the abyss doctor is Rasca, a female?! Like.. it doesn't matter to her, as much as you think. She just transforms whatever she wants to be due to aura, or whatever she said." said Cara, as Jomi grabbed her arm and looked at her forearm. "That's.. a lot of cuts." commented Jomi, as Cara pulled back. "I.. don't know where that came from. I'm serious. Anyways, how do I get out of here.. Oh, don't worry. I know now, just explain to your.. lightner friends that I escaped by overpowering you but escaping through my restraints.. or not, whatever is easier for you to say. Bye!" said Cara as a portal is summoned behind her and she goes into it, still looking at Jomi.

Jomi goes and opens the door, as she sees Mijo and Rhida talking. "Hey.. uh.. um.. Cara.. escaped.." said Jomi, as the two looked at her, very concerned. "W—what happened?! Did she hurt you?" asked Mijo, before Jomi shook her head. "No.. umm.. she.. didn't.. she escaped.. but.. um.. yeah." said Jomi, as Rhida looked at Jomi, narrowing her eyes. "Jomi..? Are you lying?" questioned Rhida, as Jomi shook her head. "N—no! I.. um.. It's.. just very hard to say." said Jomi, before Mijo narrowed his eyes too. "Hold on.." said Jomi, as she took a deep breath and looked away for a while.

"Ok.. so, Cara escaped.. the restraints were obviously not going to hold her back.. She broke out of it, but.. she didn't attack me. She said some things I would rather not say before leaving through a portal she made." answered Jomi, as the other two looked at each other. "Alright. Whatever secret you're keeping, Jomi.. Hope it's not harmful to yourself." said Mijo, as he patted her back and they went on with their day, fixing what Cara ruined.

## Author's Note:

Ends another chapter in my nsfw exploration, I did NOT anticipate Cara's character development, tbh. It just.. happened, and I continued it. With the subject of tentacle use.. I so happen to know how it happened exactly, even today. I know what and who 'implanted' the idea into my mind.

Anyways, it's Island of the Dead. If you see that title on a certain website with.. erotic anime.. If you know, you know. Anyway, stay tuned for more, and bye!

<!--Cara and Rasca character development.. HORROR SEX how does that work..?-->
<p id="S8"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Cycle of the Darkest Pleasure</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Jomi wakes up and she is forced to fight this unknowable enemy, spawning the abominations of the forest. She has this power to resurrect herself after death, but at what cost?

## Author's Note:

Well, this is another weird chapter. This is mainly because of the.. ahem. Scenes of certain anime that were very horrifying but you know.. arousing.. So, I wanted to make my own again. Get it out of my system again. (I need help)

It.. uh.. I was specifically looking for these types and found one. So, after that session.. ahem. I wanted to write this. Anyways, no plot here. Maybe a little bit of characterization, but yeah.. expecting the plot to make sense in.. smut is.. well, good luck!

**_WARNING: Sexual content, with tentacles (again) + basically non-con but it's monsters what do you expect?_**

"Ugh.. aww..." said Jomi before she suddenly gasped at the tentacle intrusion at her core. "Hey!" exclaimed Jomi as she managed to get the tentacle and kill it using her summoned sword. "That... was about to.. oh no.. what's Cara going to do now..?" asked Jomi to herself, as she looked around her, already feeling dread for the day in front of her.

"My dear Caj!" said Cara as she appeared from the shadows with little tentacles coming from her back. "It's you.. oh gosh.. it's you.. please for the love of the world, don't hurt me again.. please.." said Cara, as she shook her head. "I won't hurt you, but.. they might." said Cara as she carries Jomi with her tentacles to the window to see her kingdom filled with monsters everywhere. 

"These have gotten a bit too rowdy for my liking, so me and the doctor agreed you should kill them, however. It comes at a price, you'll see what it is soon.. You're immortal by the way now, but I control your revive." said Cara as she chuckled a bit. "Well? Go at it my Jomi, show these insolent monsters how powerful the dark princess is." said Cara as she gave Jomi's battle suit to her. "I.. this feels too weird. Aren't you aligned with these monsters? What do you mean when you said they were rowdy? Couldn't you just kill them?" asked Jomi as she dressed up in her battle suit.

"Haha.. Well you see that's the problem. I may or may not split my power into all of the monsters here.. So, you're going to have to.. yeah. But I'm still powerful!" said Cara, as Jomi looked at her. "Ohh.. Then that's why I was able to.. wait. I have to fight the monsters either way, but if I give you power again.. Then, you'll hurt me again. But, how.. do I not do that, while keeping the city safe..?" asked Jomi, as Cara laughed and approached Jomi. "Figure it out. But.. If you die, I won't revive you. You'll be stuck under my control, as your body is used by these monsters for breeding." threatened Cara as Jomi steps back, knowing she has power but knowing Cara still has the upper hand.

"W—what!!? O—okay.. Fine.. But you promise you won't hurt me okay?" asked Jomi as Cara nodded, as she inspected her tentacles. "Mmm.. As long as you obey. Now, let's go, Jomi, while I can watch from the sidelines you'll need to be the one to kill them. These monsters while perfect for my controlled attacks have broken free.. Taking _my_ power with them. Be a kind dear, and help me." repeated Cara before she looked across the city.

"Y—yeah.. I know.. I know.. You want to gain your power back and punish these monsters while using me as bait. Fine, but you promise.. to revive me, okay?" said Jomi as Cara nodded and they headed down the castle. Once they went out, the first monsters was a zombie horde. "Oops.. Well, good luck!" said Cara before watching from the sidelines as Jomi faced off the horde. "Easy. I've fought hordes like these." said Jomi as she tried to use her usual fighting style that was aggressive and quick, but the zombies managed to make her mess up causing her to drop her sword as they held her down.

"H—huh? C—Cara!! Help!" shouted Jomi as Cara smirked and responded, "I can't help you, remember? My power is split in these hordes, but I can't kill them myself. I see you're realizing how.. eager these monsters are for the breeding? Let me just say, good luck." before the zombies finally overpower Jomi and rip off her clothes, revealing her big supple breasts and tight pussy. "N—no!! Cara!?" said Jomi before the zombies pull out their dicks and start fucking her.

Jomi is raped from all of her holes as she is molested and touched at her breasts. She can't help but moan and whimper as these monsters fuck her. "Oh? I think I just figured something out. Jomi, hold on dear.." said Cara as she was casting some spell. "Cara!! H—help..?" said Jomi as she continues to be fucked by the zombies, their dicks penetrating deep and hard. "Hold on.. dear, I just have to.." said Cara as she continued focusing on the spell. "Cara... They're.. they're about to come.." said Jomi as she felt her climax approaching at her belly. "Abyssal Reign." said Cara as she cast the spell on the zombies, causing them to falter as Jomi manages to escape out of their grasp before being bitten in the neck by one of them as the other one finishes inside. 

Cara quickly finishes the job by picking up her sword and killing the zombies as she revives Jomi with her battlesuit intact as she gives the sword back. "I.. Cara.." Jomi hugs her, making her falter in her usual mocking tone. "Huh? What?" asked Cara as Jomi started crying. "I don't want to be.. raped again.. please.." said Jomi, as she cried on Cara's shoulders. Cara sighs and pats her in the back. After a while, Jomi pulls back and is now just sniffling as she looks at Cara. "Cara.. cara.. I.. don't want to fight anymore.." said Jomi as she was shaking, remembering what happened but her body was the same before the zombie horde appeared.

"Tch. Whatever. These zombies.. how brutal I have not seen this.. primal sexual side to them.." said Cara as she looked away from Jomi, she didn't want to admit it to Jomi, but she was genuinely shocked and empathetic to Jomi. "Cara..?" asked Jomi as she touched her shoulder. Cara immediately recoiled from the touch as she looked at her, clearly shocked but also fearful. "C—Cara?" asked Jomi as she looked at Cara's expression, with a hint of concern. Cara quickly changed to a neutral expression as she said, "N—nevermind. Whatever, let's go, dear." as she dragged Jomi with her.

Jomi and Cara found some water that looked very suspiciously alive. "Stop. Let me handle this. Do the final blow, okay?" said Cara as she uses her tentacles to touch the water as it suddenly started to form tentacles. "NOW!" shouted Cara as Jomi quickly dispatched the water tentacles. The two looked at each other as they looked at the empty space where the water was. "Even.. water can be monsters? Cara, I don't know what you were doing with these monsters.. but, you have to stop once we're done taking care of them." said Jomi, as Cara dismissed her with a hand wave. "It'll be fine! As long as I don't lose power again. Anyways, I got this one, let's move on." said Cara as they walked together again.

They arrived at an entrance to a cave as they saw a big flesh monster. "Oh damn.. Must've been their merging. Jomi, take care of this would you?" said Cara as she pushed Jomi to fight the huge tentacle-like flesh monster. "I.. no.. this.. is horrifying.. Promise you..?" asked Jomi as Cara immediately answered. Yeah.. yeah! I gotchu. Just, fight it." said Cara, hiding her somewhat anxious and fear of the abomination that she unwittingly created.

Jomi quickly started to go into battle mode as she summoned slashes to cut down the monster, weakening it for Cara. 

'Damn it.. This monster has more of my power than I thought.. Stupid stupid.. Cara.. If you just warned the doctor to not carelessly use her abyss powers to create new monsters, you wouldn't have to be.. be.. submissive to your slave, Jomi..' thought Cara as she watched Jomi fight the regenerating flesh monster. 

"Cara! Help!!" said Jomi as she is trying to fight off the entanglement of the flesh monster. "Oh right!" said Cara as she started to cast the abyssal reign spell. "Cara!!" said Jomi as her clothes were ripped off. 

Cara thought that she was a horny abyss gal, but even she couldn't be happy seeing Jomi get violated like this. No pleasure, just pure breeding instinct. "Jomi..! Damn it.. You'll have to hold on for a bit.. This one's harder to.. disintegrate.. I also won't be able to revive you until then, so.." said Cara with an awkward smile.

"Cara..!! Do faster! They're—" said Jomi before a tentacle is inserted inside her pussy. She instantly gasps at this as she is trying as hard as she can to escape.

'Damn.. not again.. I can't.. watch. Funny to say, huh? An abyss queen, used to being evil.. Horrified by the monsters she has created.. Ironic. But, I have to.. I have to kill this monster, for Jomi—' thought Cara before she cut herself off. 'D—did.. I.. just.. care about Jomi?!' thought Cara, as Jomi's screams and shouts reminded her of what she's supposed to be doing.

"Cara!! They're.. they're.. stretching me.. please.. you have to.." said Jomi before a tentacle inserted at her ass as she gasps and stops talking coherently.

"Enough. You've done enough." said Cara before casting, "ABYSSAL REIGN!" shouted Cara as the spell was blasted to the flesh monster, causing it to unentangle Jomi. Jomi instantly took this opportunity to get her sword and stab and slice it to pieces finally disintegrating it.

"Cara.. please revive me.. I.. can't.. live.." said Jomi before falling to the ground, noticeably bleeding on her crotch and ass area. Cara looked visibly distraught looking at Jomi's body, as much as didn't want to admit it, she was scared. 

"Okay, alright.. you.." said Cara before stopping herself, she feels disgusted now at what just happened. "What.. is this.. feeling.. Why do I feel.. scared? I.. have been here before.. not having power.. and.. forced to fight.." said Cara as she looked at Jomi's naked and bleeding body. "Nevermind. I can do this, feelings are temporary.. Power.. power will stop these.." said Cara as she revives Jomi with her unripped clothes and sword.

As Jomi is revived, she looks at Cara distraught and shaken. "C—cara.. you.. promised.." said Jomi before she trailed off, managing to just stare at Cara. Cara stepped back, as she expressed a hurt emotion that the two didn't expect would happen.

"Cara? A—are you?" said Jomi as she turned her head, questioning what has changed Cara beyond her sadomasochistic tendencies.

"Nothing. I.. simply was.. going out of the cave.. Yeah, whatever." said Cara as she held Jomi's hand and walked out of the cave.

"I.. Cara, are you.. scared?" asked Jomi as Cara stopped walking. "No. I'm not. I'm confident in our skills as a duo to kill these disobedient monsters." said Cara in a stern tone before walking.

'I just have to keep my confidence up.. Maybe it'll go well if I stop doubting my abyssal powers..' thought Cara as they walked through the forest.

"You know I hate you right?" said Jomi, as Cara turned to face Jomi, looking strained. "Do I look like I care? I still have my power over you, Jomi. I don't need your approval, slave." said Cara before Cara quickly turned away and dragged Jomi with her again.

They walked until they found many plant monsters that Jomi quickly took out as Cara cast a spell to disintegrate then, gaining her power back one by one, until they arrive at another cave. 

"Another one? Ugh.. Hopefully this is the last one.." said Cara as they walked inside and saw two large spiders and a larger mother spiders, that immediately notice them, the view of the insides contributing to the two girls' disgust.

"I feel confident about this one. Go." said Cara as Jomi didn't budge. "You said that last time. I don't trust you. I'm not going." assserted Jomi, as Cara turned to Jomi, looking mad. "Then I'll feed you to these spiders whether you like it or not." said Cara before a spider appeared behind her and entangled her.

As soon as this happened, the world for Cara slowed down. 'No.. I.. got.. no! I can't give up!' thought Cara as she struggled with the spider. "Jomi! Help me, you slave!" said Cara as Jomi watched, unamused. "You'll lose your revive if you—" said Cara before a tentacle managed to get up her skirt and touch her core. 

'No.. no no no!' thought Cara as she used her own tentacles to push the spider back from her and once she got out she immediately used her tentacles to slap it back, now regrouping with its brethren.

"Jomi. Now." said Cara as she used her tentacles to push Jomi to the spiders but instead she cut off her tentacles, causing her to falter and fall to the ground. Cara quickly got up and glared at Jomi, as she shrugged her shoulders and fought the spiders.

"You.." said Cara as Jomi manages to stab and slash the spiders, but as expected she gets overwhelmed and the mother spider traps her. "Cara!! Help!!" shouted Jomi as Cara expected. "Oh? So you want me, to help you after you just.. left me to die to these spiders? Yeah right. I'll leave you to die." said Cara, in a mocking tone before turning her back and taking a step.

Jomi couldn't say anything as she was wrapped and tied up in spider silk while little monsters invade her skin and go inside, consuming her from the inside, as she bleeds. 'Oh gosh.. I.. shouldn't have left her.. no.. but I should've.. but.. Cara.. pleeeasee.. help..' thought Jomi as she looked at Cara slowly walking out.

'Damn it.. why is soo hard to leave this slave alone.. I can do it.. I just need her to die first.. But, why am I not.. I can't leave her.." though Cara as she struggled to keep walking, to ignore Jomi.

'Cara, what if you were never revived? By the doctor after the first cataclysm? Would you have stayed dead?' asked a voice to herself as she looked around and didn't see any immediate people except Jomi and the spiders. "I would.. yes." said Cara as she stopped walking. 'Then.. why aren't you helping Jomi? You owe her your life. You know you can't control Jomi, you have no power. You know by leaving Jomi to suffer more you will hurt your chances of getting her back under your thumb. Are you even strong enough, to fight them? You barely survived the spider, even with some of your powers back. Tell me, Cara. Do you need Jomi?' the voice continued.

"I.. stop.. stop saying this.. I.. need her, but I could always explore other paths." said Cara as she turned to look at Jomi's degrading body. 'Oh? But you chose this one, so there must be a reason.' the voice retorted. "Ahh! Who even are you? Get out of my **head**." said Cara as she looked at Jomi. "She's right though." said Cara as she started to cast the spell.

"Abyssal Reign.." said Cara as she blasts it on the spiders, the spider silk disappearing as Jomi suddenly is freed and immediately uses the opportunity to grab her sword. She stabs and slashes, she is running on instinct and adrenaline, her entire body is collapsing as Jomi finished them off. "It hurts.." said Jomi before falling over, the wounds too much for Jomi to bare again.

Cara silently approached Jomi's body and revived her, as her body was healed and clothes returned. Cara picked up her sword and gave it to her as Jomi sheathed it silently, not looking at Cara. Then Jomi took a moment to check herself, as she touched the spots in her body where the little monsters entered. "I.. don't remember how I lived.. But, by this.. this means that you need my body to revive me, correct?" asked Jomi as Cara nodded.

"Okay. Let's.. continue.. I.. wanna end this as fast as possible." said Jomi as she walks to the exit of the cave. "I.. yeah. I agree." said Cara as she followed Jomi out.

They walked for a few more meters, subduing and collecting the other plant monsters and zombies' powers until they arrive at a part of the town.

"Oh." said Cara as she saw the controlled populace, seemingly controlled by some hivemind. "I'll take care of this." said Cara as she confidently strode to a possessed human. "Obey." said Cara to the possessed human as she tried to make it walk away or attack it's fellow monsters, but instead she felt a sharp pain stab at her chest, like someone else was stopping her from controlling them. She fell to her knees, with tears forming in her eyes.

Jomi quickly unsheathed her sword and stabbed the possesed human as more of the hivemind came in, like a zombie horde all over again. "Cara? Are you good? There's a lot of them.." asked Jomi as she looked at Cara crying, unusual to both of them. "Shit. Cara, let's go!" said Jomi as she grabbed Jomi and ran away.

'What..? How.. There must be someone who.. took enough power to control that thing.. But.. no.. I.. have regained a lot of my power.. how is somebody still stronger than me?' thought Cara as she is carried by Jomi from place to place. 'That.. stupid zombie.. It.. made me look weak in front of.. of.. Jomi. Now she's the one fighting for me.. What a coward.. The Abyssal Queen's fall from grace..' continued Cara before Jomi slapped her face, making her come back to reality.

"Cara! Please. I don't know how much you're going through.. But, I need your help..!" said Jomi, as she points to a butcher zombie approaching and hundreds of zombies behind it. "Hehe.. you saw me. What can I even do against them?" asked Cara as she looked at the zombies approaching. "I.. don't know..! But please.. please. You have to think of something, this time it might not just be me who dies.." said Jomi, as Cara chuckled and laid on the ground.

"Let's just die instead, wouldn't that be.. fun?" said Cara as she looked at Jomi, horrified. "B—but you said.. if you don't revive me, I'll be bred until I disintegrate.." said Jomi, as Cara changed to sitting down while leaning against a wall. "Well, who's to say we won't enjoy that?" said Cara as she chuckled at herself. "Cara!" said Jomi sternly  as she pointed her sword to Cara.

"Kill me. I dare you." said Cara as she summoned her tentacles behind her. "Cara..!" shouted Jomi as she is dragged by the zombies. "Take me.. You're not looking at your master anyway, just a remnant." said Cara as she retracts her tentacles and let's the zombies take her away.

'This is the end? I don't know. It feels.. freeing though. I don't care how much they harm this body, I'm used to it by now. Still, I can't help but wonder what Jomi thinks. I.. have failed her, myself, the doctor, and the kingdom.. But, still.. I feel.. like I deserve this for all the harm I inflicted.. even if it's by me..' thought Cara as the zombies raped her and Jomi's body.

'I.. do I feel it? Yes.. but.. I've learned to numb myself at my body's pain, after all.. I do use abyss magic. Still.. giving up here..? Why am I so cowardly? When I used to be so confident, arrogant to some people. I guess, my fragile ego and pride shattered. Haha.. so reliant on the doctor.. now, on Jomi.. Am I really a queen?' continued Cara as her body gets torn apart by the zombie butcher, but at this point she doesn't care anymore.

'Just kill me..' thought Cara before her head got cut off.

_Black. Darkness. Am I dead?_

'Am I free?' thought Cara as she looked around her, darkness all around. "I hope I am.." said Cara as she looked at herself, her original queen form, without tentacles, before the doctor and the first catacylsm. "Yeah. This is not the world I came from." said Cara as she inspected her outfit, it was her battle suit she used with Jomi during the war of the roses.

"I remember.. This is.. the war of the roses.. that solidified my control over the dark world." said Cara as she smiled. "But.. what am I supposed to do here..? Sit alone forever?" asked Cara to herself as she sat down in the endless void. "Well.. I suppose that'll be fun, I can use my clothes for entertainment if I need to.. Still, I guess I should reflect." said Cara as she looked at her outfit more clearly, a light blue coat adorned with yellow stripes and shoulder broads. 

"I miss those days.. before the lightners. Before that.. split with.. ugh. I can never forget that day, when I separated Jomi from myself, giving her no memories so that I can have a better chance at retaining my abyss throne." said Cara as she looked at her pants, normal light blue with light brown boots ready for combat. "I.. don't know what to say for myself." said Cara before the ground below her suddenly started to crack and eventually open up.

**_QUEEN. YOUR TIME HASN'T COME YET._**

"Isn't that.. the doctor?" thought Cara before she woke up tied up, and being raped by zombies as she sees Jomi being raped right in front of her by a monstrous baby-like creature, using her body while playing with her ripped leg. She seemed.. braindead, like her brain was controlled by it, her lewd face is something Cara never saw, at least.. whenever they had those sexy times.

"But.. my body.. what's this..?" asked Cara as she looked at her body, it's another woman's body, presumably one of the city residents, likely dead before she possessed her. "Let's end this." said Cara as she looked at the zombies, they were relatively easy to control now, as she basically numbed herself so much the pain of wrestling control didn't matter as much.

"Now.. you..!" said Cara as she looked at the baby-like monstrous creature. "You don't deserve Jomi. You're my creation. You do not have the right to use her." said Jomi sternly as she uses the zombies against the baby monster, causing it to let go of Jomi. "Her body needs to be.." said Cara before she picked up a butcher's knife and killed her, putting her out of the misery that the baby monster inflicted upon Jomi. "This is yours, isn't it?" asked Cara before she threw it at the baby-monster as it cried out in anguish.

"I shall take you back to your mama.. That's me." said Cara as she cast her spell, "ABYSSAL REIGN!" at the monsters. Everywhere around her, the monsters slowly disintegrated as their power went to her. The sudden power up made even her numbing self hurt a little, as the abyss queen's power was back at the true holder. She quickly took the pain quite well, unlike before she wasn't doubting herself, since what was there to lose anyway?

"The hivemind.. finally gone.." said Cara as her pain tolerance slowly went back to normal, widening her eyes a bit. "Ah! The... it hurts.. everything.. my.. breasts.. my mouth.. throat.. vagina.. ass.. everything.." said Cara as she looked at herself, multiple bruises and wounds covered her body. "Who.. nevermind. I need to revive Jomi first, then.. then she can get me to the doctor." said Cara as she looked at Jomi's torn body, her arms and legs were ripped apart from her torso, her holes completely filled, blood all around and most importantly, a lewd Jomi face before Cara stabbed her brain to kill her.

"Alright, Jomi.. wake up. Your time hasn't come yet." said Cara as she revived Jomi to her normal form, no damages to her body, and clothing. As soon as Jomi was conscious enough she looked at the beaten and battered body of.. Cara apparently, though she couldn't recognize her. "Cara? CARA!!" said Jomi before she hugged Cara, even though Cara's body was hurting, Cara didn't budge, she didn't care anyway, this body was temporary, its original owner died.

"Jomi.." said Cara as she tightened the hug. After a while, Jomi pulled back. "You.. what happened? H—how did you revive? I saw you.. y—your—" said Jomi before crying. "head.. cut off.. your arms.. cut off.. your legs.. cut off.. everything was used to create the abomination that.. that.. ah.. I.. hurt.. remember.." said Jomi as she touched the temple of her head. "It controlled your body, your brain.. you couldn't die. It prevented you from dying, otherwise.. you wouldn't experience it.. and not be able to breed its.. children." said Cara, in a fearful tone.

"I—is that what h—happened..? I.. must be.. manipulated.. I guess, I only remember being trapped by that abomination, it touched me.. and.. suddenly.. I can't remember.. it must be when it start controlling my brain.. The only thing I felt was pleasure, ecstasy and the feeling of being controlled by something in my brain.. I.. there were also those.. eating inside monsters as well.. but.. by this point, everything hurt.. I couldn't.. pinpoint where.. but everything did." said Jomi as Cara looked at her concerned. 

"At least you're fine now. I.. am not. As you can see, this body does not look like me. It isn't mine. I took a dead body that was being used for breeding. My body from the doctor has.. been presumably destroyed by these.. monsters of mine." explained Cara, as Jomi nodded. "But where is.. is.. the doctor? What was she doing all this time?" asked Jomi as Cara looked around. "I don't know.. But she did revive me.." answered Cara, as they went silent to think about it.

"Cara! Jomi! You've done it!" said Rasca, the doctor as she bursts into the room, with clearly ripped clothes and tear streaks. "Yeah, I was here.. You mustn't have realized because you were.. busy. But, I was in the outer room, being.. part of this mess." said Rasca as she visibly looked away in shame. 

"But! I did manage to do one **thing** right, it was.. bring Cara from the dead.. But, her body.. since it was used by the monsters.. I'm going to have to create a new one.. But, hey, you could just use that!" said Rasca, pointing to Cara. "I guess. But, my tentacles.." said Cara as Rasca smiled, seemingly trying to forget what happened to her earlier. "I can make those! Easier to do." answered Cara, before going back to a sad expression.

"So.. what now?" asked Jomi, as Rasca moved closer, her body was obviously used, bruised and badly beaten, like Cara, but she was ignoring it. "We fix things. Let's just say this was a bad abyss invasion.. Because it was, but that the abyss order didn't have anything to do with it, and.. we can just use our current forms! I'm sure no one would expect it." answered Cara, already thinking of her ambition.

"Rasca.. are you.. fine?" asked Cara as Rasca looked at Cara, her happiness shattered. Rasca looked away, and explained, "No.. I'm not. You can tell right? But, I was just hoping to use what we have gotten for.. these types of.. aftermaths.. T—trust me.. I would've used something else.. or not even done this.. **'experiment'** if I knew it would lead.. to our new trauma." hiding her face, but her voice was clearly trembling.

"Let's.. just rest for a while.." said Cara as she laid down on the ground. "Yeah.. I don't have any physical traumas.. but.. those phantom pains.. gosh.." added Jomi, before Rasca silently joined them in their laying down on the ground staring off to the broken ceiling and the moon.

## Author's Note:

It seems I like writing villains with character development, this one was built out of passion (hehe) but also just a general interest to tragic characters, I mean.. yes you could just say that Cara isn't forgiven just because she had a tragic backstory, but that doesn't mean you have to like her! It's just her motivations on how she got there. Take note, canon is still vague, since I don't know how to incorporate this yet, but anyways see you!

## My Darkest Night Cut Draft Ending 1

---

'Whew.. Finally home after working for Jomi..' thought Rasca as she entered her home and rested on her couch. The house she bought to make herself lie low in the city and cooperate with Jomi after the second cataclysm is not much, but it's enough for her. Good living room, good and big bed, good kitchen, and fair bathroom. Perfect for two. 

'Cara.. She had to live on the other side of the city..' thought Rasca as she looked at her notes. They decided to do this just in case anyone finds out about them, after all they're the main cause of all the cataclysmic events that happened before, and while Jomi has somewhat forgiven them, she still keeps them on the low, to prevent anyone else that hasn't seen their more vulnerable sides from killing them.

'They have a good reason.. It's just.. We both wanna live.' thought Cara as she drank from her tumbler, filled with iced coffee. It was something she always craved but never got the chance to do before and during the first and second cataclysms. But now, she can finally enjoy her life, without having to manipulate Cara, Jomi and the abyss order.

_Knock, knock!_

"Oh.. that must be Mijo.." said Rasca, as she put on a smile and opened the door. Now usually, she expects Mijo to be smiling as they've talked about a lot of nerdy stuff, something she always had interest in, but can never discuss due to how important her abyss doctor work is. But **today**, was different.

Mijo looked too happy, like he was in glee after he beat an enemy or when someone uses something that should anger or sadden someone and laugh, like they're already accepting. "Hello, Rasca!" greeted Mijo as he let himself inside as Rasca closed the door.

"Mijo! How's it been!" said Rasca as she tried to do their usual handshake but as soon as Mijo touched her hand, she was shocked. "Ah! M—mijo!" said Rasca as she looked at her hand. "Woops! I expected that someone of as high as a crime as causing the two catacylsms, as well as reviving the evil Cara, would be able to stand a little zap from me?" said Mijo, sarcastic as he looked at Rasca, with a sinister smile.

"H—huh?" asked Rasca, as she was also shocked from this blunt approach by Mijo, but also by how did he figure out. 'How.. did he? No, I must look like I'm innocent.. I.. can't let him! I'm the doctor.. damn it.' thought Rasca, as she looked at Mijo, more assertive. 

"Oh? You're confused? I just.. snooped into your house one night, and decided to search through your stuff, because.. I wanted to! Your door was open anyway, ahahaha..!" said Mijo, as he summoned a sword at his hip. 

'WHAT?! D—did he really..? I was.. just exhausted that night.. me, Cara and Jomi were in a particularly bad situation before we managed to overcome it.. I didn't bother to lock my door.. nor did I even go to bed.. I just slept on my couch until the day rose.. I must have.. no.. it was locked! That could only mean one thing.. He intentionally baited me! After figuring my identity.. I would've definitely noticed if a few things were snooped around.. Because, he surprised me that morning and talked as I hurriedly fixed my house and self.. Ugh..' thought Rasca as her breathing became more hurried.

"Your little blue and pink notebooks.. While filled with your degenerate writing about your life also contained notes.. about the _abyss doctor_. Now, I recognize the doctor's handwriting.. This is exactly it. Other than that, don't worry, I didn't do anything else, because I want you to experience it.. conscious." said Mijo as he unsheathed his sword and pointed it at her. "Feel my wrath." said Mijo, as electricity was surrounding Mijo, ready to electrocute Rasca.

"I..! You haven't given me time to—" said Cara before the blade was almost touching her neck. "P—please..! Let me explain myself..! I'm not them! You have to.." pleaded Rasca, as Mijo's imposing form went closer. "Hmm.. I'm not feeling I should kill you, but rather.. sex. Yes, how about sex?" said Mijo, as he sheathed his sword.

'Sex..? Is he.. He.. can't do that right? He told me he has a girlfriend, he had sex with her before.. and now he wants me to fuck him? Oh no.. he's.. using my identity to get himself free sex, hurting me..' though Rasca, as she was genuinely panicking, her weapons and other accessories that made her strong were unprepared and were moved to her room at Jomi's castle, she didn't know what to do.

"S—sex?! Mijo! I thought you were.. a decent person.. Someone who would stand up for the people.. Surely you won't use your accusation to make me have.. sex right?" asked Rasca as Mijo smiled. That damned smile was the only thing she needed to see, he wasn't going to back off, he was getting his way, no matter what. "I will, if it's to hurt you, Rasca." said Mijo as he took off his clothes, his muscles and abs showing. 

'Fuck.. why do bad people always have to be handsome?! I can't let it show though. I need to get through his head and realize he's just raping an innocent woman that coincidentally had the notes.. Hmm.. I.. grabbed it to study it, yeah..! I'm assuming Jomi will know what happened and support me.. hopefully..' thought Rasca as he looked down to see his dick, almost throbbing with need.

"H—hey! I.. don't want this.. anything you're thinking.. W—we can move on if you just listen to me for—" said Rasca before Mijo pinned her to the wall, as he looked at her boobs, covered by her work clothes. "Mijo! I beg of you, I'll forgive anything you've done.. Just, believe me.. when I say that I grabbed those notebooks from her highness Jomi to study! I—I swear.. in all of the holy gods.. I'm innocent..!" said Rasca, as Mijo ignored her and slowly took off her clothes.

"Please.. please stop.." begged Rasca as Mijo touched her in her intimate areas. She was genuinely scared and fearful of Mijo here, and this outpour of emotion was real too, even though she was hiding her identity, she doesn't know why Mijo is so stubborn at listening to her when he said that he often talks and listens to his girlfriend, and even people call him a great listener, why was he doing this? If she was genuinely innocent, then Mijo has no good reason to be doing this.

'No.. Mijo.. please.. just. Ugh.. Why is he like this? So..' Rasca's thoughts are interrupted when Mijo sensually bites her neck. "Mijo! Mijo.." Rasca's voice is more soft now, but still trembling. 'So aggressive.. I knew of his battle skills.. But he seems to be quite invested in my body...' thought Cara before Mijo hit a spot that made her involuntarily moan. "Mnn.. Mijo.." said Rasca, her voice now becoming more sensual.

Mijo eventually decided to insert his dick inside her, making her instinctively try to remove the intrusion. "Tightening yourself for me? Haha!" said Mijo before dragging Rasca to the couch, making her more vulnerable as he pushed inside her. "Mijo!! Stop..." said Rasca, as her voice weakened, she was giving up on the prospect of getting out without being filled with cum. 

'No.. I can't get out.. he's too.. too much..! I can't hold on forever.. Ugh.. I'm exhausted thinking..' thought Rasca as she felt her body limp and submit to Mijo's will. 'I can feel.. my brain shutting down..' continued Rasca as her eyes slowly started to close. "Mijo.. please.. just.. finish.." whispered Rasca, before she fell unconscious.

"AHHH!!!" screamed Rasca as Mijo continued to fuck her, while shocking her body back to consciousness. "Mijo.. it hurts.." said Rasca as she felt the sharp pain that enveloped her arms and legs, outcompeting the pleasure from her rape. "Feel your degrading humiliation." said Mijo as he pulled out before he could cum and stroked himself to cum at Jomi. The cum covered her belly as he continued to fuck her.

'Why is he not stopping.. please... stop..' thought Rasca before he came again, this time covering her face with his cum. 'Disgusting.. His.. cum.. on my face..' thought Cara before he made her suck on his dick by immediately directing her head to his dick. As she sucked on his dick, her tears flowed freely. She was holding back her crying, but now she can't control it. 'Mijo..! His dick tastes horrible.. I hate it.. I hate this..' thought Rasca before Mijo came inside her mouth, as he pulled out. Rasca was forced to swallow as her breathing quickened.

"A—are you satisfied..? Raping an innocent girl, just so you can take out your sexual anger to the abyss doctor?" asked Rasca, as she laid on the bedframe behind her. "Not yet." said Mijo, as he inserted into her ass and fucked her there. 'I.. don't want to exist anymore.. Is my existence doomed to suffering? Am I meant to be an evil abyss doctor? I can't take it anymore.. but he'll shock me if I sleep.. gosh.. make it stop..' said Rasca, as Mijo came inside Caj's ass. Mijo pulled out and moved to her pussy again, inserting with no care for Rasca.

'Endure.. just endure.. in a few moments.. he'll be done..' thought Rasca as Mijo ramped up his assault, hurting her. "Mijo!! Slow down.. hurt.." said Rasca as the pain became too much to bear and her mind shut down again.

"AGH!!!" screamed Rasca as more electricity went through her body from Mijo. 'That hurt more..! Okay, Rasca just.. keep yourself alive..' thought Rasca before Mijo came inside her, filing her womb with his cum. Mijo remained inside her for a while before pulling out, as he put his dick on her thigh, the remaining cum staining her bed and her thighs. Rasca looked at Mijo absent-mindedly before succumbing to exhaustion.

"You've done well, doc. I won't reveal your identity yet, and I won't.. as long as you keep this sex with me, got it? Don't worry, I'll remind you next time, bye!" whispered Mijo to Rasca's ear before going out.

Rasca woke up in a cold sweat as dried cum was all over her, as well as not even being blanket covered but instead left by Mijo to freeze at the midnight wind. She quickly got up and mechanically cleaned herself, the bed and the sofa before going to bed in her home clothes, hoping to forget what just happened.

_Next day, she's recently finished work and is about to head home_

"Rasca." said Jomi, as Rasca was stopped dead in her tracks. "Oh.. is there a new abyss threat you want me to take care of?" asked Rasca, her tone a bit soft. "Hey, is there something wrong? I noticed.. You aren't as energetic or.. happy like yesterday.. Tell me everything, I promise I'll listen." said Jomi, as she grabbed Rasca's hand and directed them to Jomi's bedroom.

"Here. Let's talk as friends rather than princess to lower noble. Rasca, what happened?" asked Jomi, as Rasca started crying. "It's just.. I don't think you'll believe me.. when I say that Mijo, the honorary leader and first knight of your guards, raped me last night.." admitted Rasca as a knock was heard. "Who's there?" asked Jomi, as Cara was heard through the door. "It's me.. Reca." said Cara, not using her real name to not arouse suspicion from anyone near Jomi's room. "Oh, ahem. Come in." said Jomi, as Cara came in and closed the door.

"Rasca? What happened?!" asked Cara as she went to her side immediately. "Oh. It's just.. Mijo's raped me, nothing out of the ordinary.." said Rasca as she tries to laugh it off, her tears still flowing. "Rasca. You mean to tell this lightner has done.. Jomi, what do you think?" asked Cara as she is restraining her anger.

"I.. where is he?" asked Jomi, a bit shakened up. "I think I saw him earlier chatting with his friends, me and Rasca don't know him that well, and.. if Rasca is telling the truth.. She'll be better with me." said Cara, as Rasca lookef at her and sighed. "You still don't.. fine. We'll stay here." added Rasca, as Jomi nodded and went outside of her room then walked around until noticing Mijo and his girlfriend, Rhida talking.

_On her way there, she felt some unknown headache before she made it close to the two._

"Oh, hey Jomi.. What's that look, something happened?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked at him seriously. "Rhida. Leave." said Jomi, as Rhida nodded and left. "Oh? Is it between us then? Okay.. go." said Mijo, as Jomi's eyes stared down Mijo's. "What did you do last night?" asked Jomi, as Mijo smiled and said, "I went to the others in the dark world. What? Did something happen last night?" asked Mijo, as Jomi sighed and took a huge gulp.

"Did you or did you not enter Rasca's house?" asked Jomi, as Mijo's eyes broke off with hers and said, "Well.. yes. Why ask? I always visit her." said Mijo, as Jomi finally gets to the point. "Rasca reported to me of a rape initiated by **_you._**" said Jomi, as Mijo widened his eyes but kept his cool.

"Hm? I'm guessing you kept me in the dark about this, but mhm. She's the **_abyss doctor_**, why do I care? You know this, because she wrote it down." said Mijo, as Jomi also widened her eyes but manages to calm down. "She.. right. You must've seen the two notebooks then? How did you get them? She never lets anyone see them." asked Jomi, as Mijo smiled and said, "Walked right in and took a look out of curiousity."

"Breaking and entering? Rape? This is unprecedented." said Jomi, as she clenched her fist. "Oh, yeah. So?" said Mijo, as he summoned and unsheathed his sword and pointed it at Jomi. Jomi widened her eyes and reached for her sword before they clashed blades. "A fight here? Hmm.. I'm bored. Can you dodge this?" taunted Mijo, before he charged up with electricity and went into light speed. Jomi looked around, but no matter where she looked Mijo was everywhere, like an afterimage of Mijo's until she's knocked down. Mijo quickly took her sword and took it for himself.

"Mijo.. what happened to you?" asked Jomi, as she was on the ground, wounded. "Eliminating potential threats to light domination." said Mijo, as his eyes glowed blue. Jomi widnened her eyes and thought, "That's not him. He.. he didn't kill me during the first cataclysm due to his beliefs of light and dark balance.. What.. no.. he must've been possessed. Like me before." thought Jomi, before she is teleported by Mijo to her bedroom.

In her bedroom, Jomi saw Rasca on the bed, naked and dripping with cum as Cara is tied up and a vibrator is used on her, as she fights the restraints. 

"What the fuck is happening.." said Jomi to herself before Mijo fucked her out of nowhere. "Ah!! Stop!" said Jomi as she is violated too. She feels hazy and couldn't resist sleep. "Ugh.. why is it so.." said Jomi before falling unconscious.

_Jomi? Jomi!!_

Jomi woke up suddenly, as Mijo was looking at her concerned. "Uh.. me and Rhida were just talking before you suddenly fainted right in front of us." said Mijo, as Rhida also looked at her. "Huh? Must've been the stress.." said Jomi, as Cara and Rasca saw Jomi and moved to her position. "Princess? What happened to her highness?" asked Rasca, as she looked at Rhida. "She fainted while me and Rhida were talking.." said Mijo, as he also avoided eye contact with Rasca.

"Rasca.." said Mijo before Cara interrupted, "This wouldn't be happening if you weren't so.. reckless Mijo! What reason do you have to justify for your actions?" exclaimed Cara, as she stood up and was glaring at Mijo. "Ahem. I have no reason. Let me explain myself, before I am dutibly punished for this horrible action." said Mijo, as he stood up too, looking saddened.

"When I was walking that night, before last night.. I felt a new sudden force.. Like I wanted to take control in more ways than one. I didn't notice however that this was simply an abyss possession. This was a different one, it only amplified my worst thoughts and actions, so over the course of two nights, I did reprehensible things to Rasca. I.. entered a home that violated my friend's trust in me, then I let my urges get to me. After so, I left. Of course, soon after I regretted the whole thing, and vehemently harmed myself until that abyss possession disappeared." said Mijo, stern and clear, prepared for his consequences.

"Abyss possession..?" asked Rasca, before she fainted.

_My abyss doctor, it is time._

"Huh?" asked Rasca, as she woke up. The castle is in ruins as a battle happens around them. "Doctor, what happened? You must've been working too much again. We need to get out of here, now." said Cara, with a sword.

"This doesn't make sense.." said Rasca as she looked at Cara. "What? Wait. a minute.. doctor? Who am I talking to?" asked Cara to herself as Mijo teleports into their convo.

"Guess I was right. This whole thing is a hoax. I'm not real, am I? I'm just some.. simulation probably. So.." said Mijo as he looked into the reader's eyes.

"Did you like it? Or not. It doesn't matter. Because I'll end our suffering now." said Mijo as he unleashed the world ending cut, decimating everything to pure darkness.

## Author's Note:

draft. not satisfied with the result. let's rewrite.

</details>

## Summary:

Rasca (the abyss doctor) is visited by Mijo almost daily, she's happy about it until Mijo figures about her true identity and is willing to do anything to make her submit to him.

## Author's Note:

Got this idea randomly when writing CotDP because of my characterization of the doctor outside of her plot relevancy. Anyways, enjoy! (given in bonus scenes, **_SEX! ALSO NON CON!_** )

canon divergent btw, since my characterisation of Mijo is incompatible with this one, I just wanted to use someone and wasn't comfortable with the others.

'Whew.. Finally home after working for Jomi..' thought Rasca as she entered her home and rested on her couch. The house she bought to make herself lie low in the city and cooperate with Jomi after the second cataclysm is not much, but it's enough for her. Good living room, good and big bed, good kitchen, and fair bathroom. Perfect for two. 

'Cara.. She had to live on the other side of the city..' thought Rasca as she looked at her notes. They decided to do this just in case anyone finds out about them, after all they're the main cause of all the cataclysmic events that happened before, and while Jomi has somewhat forgiven them, she still keeps them on the low, to prevent anyone else that hasn't seen their more vulnerable sides from killing them.

'They have a good reason.. It's just.. We both wanna live.' thought Cara as she drank from her tumbler, filled with iced coffee. It was something she always craved but never got the chance to do before and during the first and second cataclysms. But now, she can finally enjoy her life, without having to manipulate Cara, Jomi and the abyss order.

_Knock, knock!_

"Oh.. that must be Mijo.." said Rasca, as she put on a smile and opened the door. Now usually, she expects Mijo to be smiling as they've talked about a lot of nerdy stuff, something she always had interest in, but can never discuss due to how important her abyss doctor work is. But **today**, was different.

Mijo looked too happy, like he was in glee after he beat an enemy or when someone uses something that should anger or sadden someone and laugh, like they're already accepting. "Hello, Rasca!" greeted Mijo as he let himself inside as Rasca closed the door.

"Mijo! How's it been!" said Rasca as she tried to do their usual handshake but as soon as Mijo touched her hand, she was shocked. "Ah! M—mijo!" said Rasca as she looked at her hand. "Woops! I expected that someone of as high as a crime as causing the two catacylsms, as well as reviving the evil Cara, would be able to stand a little zap from me?" said Mijo, sarcastic as he looked at Rasca, with a sinister smile.

"H—huh?" asked Rasca, as she was also shocked from this blunt approach by Mijo, but also by how did he figure out. 'How.. did he? No, I must look like I'm innocent.. I.. can't let him! I'm the doctor.. damn it.' thought Rasca, as she looked at Mijo, more assertive. 

"Oh? You're confused? I just.. snooped into your house one night, and decided to search through your stuff, because.. I wanted to! Your door was open anyway, ahahaha..!" said Mijo, as he summoned a sword at his hip. 

'WHAT?! D—did he really..? I was.. just exhausted that night.. me, Cara and Jomi were in a particularly bad situation before we managed to overcome it.. I didn't bother to lock my door.. nor did I even go to bed.. I just slept on my couch until the day rose.. I must have.. no.. it was locked! That could only mean one thing.. He intentionally baited me! After figuring my identity.. I would've definitely noticed if a few things were snooped around.. Because, he surprised me that morning and talked as I hurriedly fixed my house and self.. Ugh..' thought Rasca as her breathing became more hurried.

"Your little blue and pink notebooks.. While filled with your degenerate writing about your life also contained notes.. about the _abyss doctor_. Now, I recognize the doctor's handwriting.. This is exactly it. Other than that, don't worry, I didn't do anything else, because I want you to experience it.. conscious." said Mijo as he unsheathed his sword and pointed it at her. "Feel my wrath." said Mijo, as electricity was surrounding Mijo, ready to electrocute Rasca.

"I..! You haven't given me time to—" said Cara before the blade was almost touching her neck. "P—please..! Let me explain myself..! I'm not them! You have to.." pleaded Rasca, as Mijo's imposing form went closer. "Hmm.. I'm not feeling I should kill you, but rather.. sex. Yes, how about sex?" said Mijo, as he sheathed his sword.

'Sex..? Is he.. He.. can't do that right? He told me he has a girlfriend, he had sex with her before.. and now he wants me to fuck him? Oh no.. he's.. using my identity to get himself free sex, hurting me..' though Rasca, as she was genuinely panicking, her weapons and other accessories that made her strong were unprepared and were moved to her room at Jomi's castle, she didn't know what to do.

"S—sex?! Mijo! I thought you were.. a decent person.. Someone who would stand up for the people.. Surely you won't use your accusation to make me have.. sex right?" asked Rasca as Mijo smiled. That damned smile was the only thing she needed to see, he wasn't going to back off, he was getting his way, no matter what. "I will, if it's to hurt you, Rasca." said Mijo as he took off his clothes, his muscles and abs showing. 

'Fuck.. why do bad people always have to be handsome?! I can't let it show though. I need to get through his head and realize he's just raping an innocent woman that coincidentally had the notes.. Hmm.. I.. grabbed it to study it, yeah..! I'm assuming Jomi will know what happened and support me.. hopefully..' thought Rasca as he looked down to see his dick, almost throbbing with need.

"H—hey! I.. don't want this.. anything you're thinking.. W—we can move on if you just listen to me for—" said Rasca before Mijo pinned her to the wall, as he looked at her boobs, covered by her work clothes. "Mijo! I beg of you, I'll forgive anything you've done.. Just, believe me.. when I say that I grabbed those notebooks from her highness Jomi to study! I—I swear.. in all of the holy gods.. I'm innocent..!" said Rasca, as Mijo ignored her and slowly took off her clothes.

"Please.. please stop.." begged Rasca as Mijo touched her in her intimate areas. She was genuinely scared and fearful of Mijo here, and this outpour of emotion was real too, even though she was hiding her identity, she doesn't know why Mijo is so stubborn at listening to her when he said that he often talks and listens to his girlfriend, and even people call him a great listener, why was he doing this? If she was genuinely innocent, then Mijo has no good reason to be doing this.

'No.. Mijo.. please.. just. Ugh.. Why is he like this? So..' Rasca's thoughts are interrupted when Mijo sensually bites her neck. "Mijo! Mijo.." Rasca's voice is more soft now, but still trembling. 'So aggressive.. I knew of his battle skills.. But he seems to be quite invested in my body...' thought Cara before Mijo hit a spot that made her involuntarily moan. "Mnn.. Mijo.." said Rasca, her voice now becoming more sensual.

Mijo eventually decided to insert his dick inside her, making her instinctively try to remove the intrusion. "Tightening yourself for me? Haha!" said Mijo before dragging Rasca to the couch, making her more vulnerable as he pushed inside her. "Mijo!! Stop..." said Rasca, as her voice weakened, she was giving up on the prospect of getting out without being filled with cum. 

'No.. I can't get out.. he's too.. too much..! I can't hold on forever.. Ugh.. I'm exhausted thinking..' thought Rasca as she felt her body limp and submit to Mijo's will. 'I can feel.. my brain shutting down..' continued Rasca as her eyes slowly started to close. "Mijo.. please.. just.. finish.." whispered Rasca, before she fell unconscious.

"AHHH!!!" screamed Rasca as Mijo continued to fuck her, while shocking her body back to consciousness. "Mijo.. it hurts.." said Rasca as she felt the sharp pain that enveloped her arms and legs, outcompeting the pleasure from her rape. "Feel your degrading humiliation." said Mijo as he pulled out before he could cum and stroked himself to cum at Jomi. The cum covered her belly as he continued to fuck her.

'Why is he not stopping.. please... stop..' thought Rasca before he came again, this time covering her face with his cum. 'Disgusting.. His.. cum.. on my face..' thought Cara before he made her suck on his dick by immediately directing her head to his dick. As she sucked on his dick, her tears flowed freely. She was holding back her crying, but now she can't control it. 'Mijo..! His dick tastes horrible.. I hate it.. I hate this..' thought Rasca before Mijo came inside her mouth, as he pulled out. Rasca was forced to swallow as her breathing quickened.

"A—are you satisfied..? Raping an innocent girl, just so you can take out your sexual anger to the abyss doctor?" asked Rasca, as she laid on the bedframe behind her. "Not yet." said Mijo, as he inserted into her ass and fucked her there. 'I.. don't want to exist anymore.. Is my existence doomed to suffering? Am I meant to be an evil abyss doctor? I can't take it anymore.. but he'll shock me if I sleep.. gosh.. make it stop..' said Rasca, as Mijo came inside Caj's ass. Mijo pulled out and moved to her pussy again, inserting with no care for Rasca.

'Endure.. just endure.. in a few moments.. he'll be done..' thought Rasca as Mijo ramped up his assault, hurting her. "Mijo!! Slow down.. hurt.." said Rasca as the pain became too much to bear and her mind shut down again.

"AGH!!!" screamed Rasca as more electricity went through her body from Mijo. 'That hurt more..! Okay, Rasca just.. keep yourself alive..' thought Rasca before Mijo came inside her, filing her womb with his cum. Mijo remained inside her for a while before pulling out, as he put his dick on her thigh, the remaining cum staining her bed and her thighs. Rasca looked at Mijo absent-mindedly before succumbing to exhaustion.

"You've done well, doc. I won't reveal your identity yet, and I won't.. as long as you keep this sex with me, got it? Don't worry, I'll remind you next time, bye!" whispered Mijo to Rasca's ear before going out.

Rasca woke up in a cold sweat as dried cum was all over her, as well as not even being blanket covered but instead left by Mijo to freeze at the midnight wind. She quickly got up and mechanically cleaned herself, the bed and the sofa before going to bed in her home clothes, hoping to forget what just happened.

Rasca woke up the next day, feeling tension she didn't last morning. 'I feel.. unsafe. Even though I checked last night, everything's safe and secure. He didn't.. touch anything else, besides.. me." thought Rasca as she got out of bed and did her morning routine.

'I gotta be confident. Get that confidence back. Why am I feeling so insecure..? Even though.. I was the most confident abyss doctor, slowly weaving the fabric of the dark world at my fingertips.. Is it because of Mijo..?" thought Rasca as she ate her breakfast, a relatively simple hotdog, egg and rice meal combo.

'Mijo.. you.. betrayed me.' thought Rasca as she started to tear up. "Out of all people that could've betrayed me.. Jomi, Cara.. you? The guy that liked me because of Rasca, and didn't know my abyss doctor past?" said Rasca, as she willingly let her tears fall, as she wiped away using a handkerchief. "I.. just.. don't know what to do.." said Rasca before burying her head on the palms of her hand.

'Did I even have a choice, in this existence?' thought Rasca as she silently sobbed at the table. "But.. whatever. I have to confront him. I can't let my pride be shut down like this. I'm getting my weapons." said Rasca, as she looked at her plate and grabbed it.

Rasca continued her morning routine, and got her things and left for Jomi's castle.

"Hey, Rasca!" said Cara as they met on the way. "Oh hi! How's it been? How's that commoner life treating you, ahaha?" asked Rasca, as Cara chuckled and answered, "It's been fine. My alibi of Jomi's so-called guards isn't complete yet so I can't sleep in her castle, how about you? You planning on eventually moving in?" asked Cara, as Rasca laughed awkwardly and said, "Yeah.. maybe." a bit soft.

Then they see Mijo, walking to them with a hidden intention behind his calm demeanor. "Oh, Mijo. Rasca, you should handle this." said Cara as Mijo approached them before Rasca could react. "Hey! Isn't it Rasca and Reca, anyway have you happened to see a certain individual by the name of Cara? She looks tall, has a black jacket, black shoes, purple shirt and glasses?" said Mijo, as he described what Cara was wearing that day.

"Huh? Um.. you mean me?" asked Cara, as Mijo smiled sinisterly. "Yeah, you. Ahem, ahem." said Mijo, as he gestured to his sword. "H—huh? What? C—come on.. Mijo, you surely know Cara is still out there, Jomi can—" said Cara before Mijo unsheathed his sword and pointed it at the two. "No excuses. I saw everything. **Abyss Doctor.** " said Mijo as he stood off against the two.

"What? Mijo.. I'm not—" said Rasca before he tackled her to the ground and kissed her before pulling away and threatening Cara. "H—hey! You're just threatening random civilians! If you want to prove we're what you're looking for, lightner. You're going to have to go to Princess Jomi!" said Cara as she stood her ground, preparing her backup pistol. "Oh? I don't think you abyssal beings have qualms about breaking the law!" said Mijo, before Jomi stopped the three.

"Mijo! Rasca! and Reca..! What's going on here?" asked Jomi, as she has her sword ready, while Rhida and JR are also with Jomi. "Oh, I just found some abyssal beings by the names of Rasca, the **_true abyss doctor_** and Cara, **_abyssal queen._** But, I'm sure you know about that quite well, right Jomi?" asked Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and looked at the two, Cara was shocked while Rasca was fearful.

"Uhuh. It's about that. Tell me, how did you—" asked Jomi before Mijo cut her off. "Rasca is your rat. She left her house open one night. I mean, if it wasn't for me, anyone could've found  out." answered Mijo, as the others are shocked about what Mijo just admitted. "Did you admit to breaking and entering?!!? Mijo, h—how.. how could you..?" said Rhida, as JR shook his head in disapproval. "Haha... You call me the villain when I am about to eliminate the main two threats to this world's peace? You can't stop me." said Mijo, as Rhida and JR stepped back a bit.

"There's a reason why I kept it secret from you lightners. I wanted them to redeem themselves first. I know things haven't been good with them, but they can change, I swear!" said Jomi, as Cara aimed the pistol at Mijo. "Jomi! Ugh.. fine. But, what does killing two darkners change, huh knight Mijo?" questioned Cara as she glared at Mijo. "Stops them from regressing. A criminal is always a criminal." said Mijo, as Jomi covered her mouth in shock.

"You literally redeemed me during the first cataclysm.. What—" said Jomi, before Mijo suddenly unleashed his sword upon the others, surprising and knocking them down in a few seconds. "I'm wasting my time. I'm finishing it now." said Mijo, as he stabbed Jomi in the chest.

The others were shocked as Mijo pulled the sword out, as Jomi widened her eyes and was bleeding out on the ground. Mijo quickly moved to Cara, disarming her before stabbing her in the chest. "No more revives after your doctor meets the same fate.. or not.." said Mijo, before killing her. 

Rasca is panicking, she was thinking of pulling out a reserve knife she had, but it was too risky to meet the same fate as Jomi and Cara, since she can revive them fully. "W—what do you want..?" asked Rasca, as Mijo smiled and looked at her. "One final sex. Then, I'll finish you off, or do you prefer being killed first, then fucking the second?" asked Mijo, as Rhida and JR couldn't hold their silence anymore, while Rasca was shaking.

"Mijo! Stop this. We'll have to intervene before you do anymore harm." said JR, as Rhida held her ice sword, now with contempt and disgust for Mijo. "Oh? What makes you think you can stop me?" said Mijo, before teleporting behind them and stabbing JR in the heart before using his scabbard to trap Rhida in his arms. "Mijo..!" called out Rhida as she struggled to get off of Mijo. "Hmm.. you know what..? It's the end of the year anyway, I'm not seeing you, since after this I'm leaving Cab City!" said Mijo as he turned Rhida's front to him, and began undressing her in front of Rasca.

'W—what the fuck?! Is he actually raping his own ex-girlfriend? I can't let him..' thought Rasca, as she struggled to stand up before being knocked back by an energy sword thrown at her by Mijo. 

"Mijo.. stop.." said Rhida, as Mijo shut her up by covering her mouth with his left hand while touching her with his right hand.

'Okay, he's.. distracted.. I just need to.. AGH!!' thought Rasca before she felt the energy sword intensify its pain on her right shoulder. 'I need to get rid of that thing..' thought Rasca as she used her left to dislodge the energy sword, causing it to fade.

"I'm going to come into you one final time, darling." said Mijo before coming inside Rhida, as he looked at her smiling. Then as he pulled out, he cut Rhida's throat. Rasca charged at him, as she pulled out her knife.

Mijo teleported and quickly deflected and attacked Rasca as her knife broke and Mijo had his sword near her head. "I.. just.. get on with it, Mijo. You've sacrificed your friends.. Jomi, all for what?" asked Rasca, as Mijo undressed her. "I wanted to finish this world off before moving on. That included killing this group. Don't worry, my friends won't remember a single thing. But you? Yeah, let's fuck. Then.. I'll kill you fast, like Rhida." said Mijo, as he finished undressing Rasca and inserted his dick into her pussy.

Rasca succumbed to Mijo, giving up on her life. 'So.. this is it.. my world.. in flames. I'm sorry. I've failed you.' said Rasca, before Mijo came inside her, letting her feel the liquid before ending her life forever.

"End of the dark world." said Mijo, before he went out into the light world, wearing school clothes.

## Author's Note:

First bonus scene with two drafts.. huh. Well, I just couldn't find a satisfying ending that fit this type without delving into too much lore stuff. I also hate how I made Mijo here, since as twisted as he is.. He's not this bad. But, when the scenario is 'Mijo finds out Rasca's true identity and rapes her for it'. It's not.. a good time if you're talking about the literal main protagonist and hero of the story. Anyways, see you next time, bye!

## Summary:

About Mijo working through his life as a shapeshifting sex curious person, switching between intense bouts of lust and depression, with him are his friends, mainly Jomi, Rhida and ~~Urda.~~

## Author's Note:

This was originally about commenting on the industry related to making sexual art, or video, but.. IDK, it's more of a commentary on how much bonus scenes and in-general dissatisfaction with life and how I live with it, in a sexual context of course.

"Sex.. sex.." said Mijo, as Jomi noticed his nakedness and intense blush and patted his shoulder. "You good?" asked Jomi, as Mijo looked at Jomi, her form flickers between her female and male form, both heavily disheveled and horny. "I um.. no. I'm just so horny today, I don't know why.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi's chest, staring it down. Jomi blushes as he does this, and comments on it, "H—hey! Stop.." Jomi squirmed under his intense gaze, as Mijo looked away and turned into his female form. 

Mijo starts touching her breasts, already moaning. "Tentacles.. take me.. use me.. breed me.." mumbled Mijo, as Jomi's blush remained, looking at Mijo touching herself. "Mijo! I.." Jomi's arousal slowly grew as she sighed and approached Mijo, lightly tapping her shoulder. "Hey—" Before Jomi could continue, Mijo took Jomi's face and kissed her as she also started to touch Jomi's breasts, undressing her. The kiss developed as their tongues went inside one another's mouth, and more movement, as they both pulled back, Jomi catching her breath.

"M—Mijo.. I.." said Jomi, still blushing as Mijo takes off her dress, revealing a black bra hiding those perky breasts. Mijo looked down, seeing normal black panties covering Jomi's slick folds. "F—fine.." said Jomi, as Mijo helps Jomi fully take off her underwear. "Just.. make it quick.." added Jomi, as Mijo straddled her and kissed her again. They grind pussies together as Mijo says to Jomi's ear, nipping her earlobe a bit. "I'm going to fuck you so hard you'll—" whispered Mijo before a knock is heard.

Jomi blushes as Mijo responds, "Who the hess are you?" There was silence, then an answer. "It's.. Rhida. Um, are you two busy?" asked Rhida, as Jomi intensely blushed. "Yeah, why?" answered Mijo, as Rhida is heard sighing and responds. "Oh, nothing. I just wanted to.. nevermind! I'm sure whatever it is, it's pretty important.. this was pretty stupid of me to do.."  said Rhida, as she left them alone and still in the middle of intercourse.

"Well.. now I'm not.. um.." said Jomi as she shifted to get Mijo off. Mijo complied and moved to her side. "I get it.. I lost mine too now.. I don't blame my love, it's.. y'know."  responded Mijo, as Jomi curled into herself. "Awkward.." added Jomi, as the heat died down.

"Mijo.. I just.. want to say something." said Jomi, as she turned to face Mijo. "Huh? What?" asked Mijo, as Jomi sighed again. "Look, I don't know how you keep this.. horny stuff goin' but.. like it's.. like an addiction y'know?" said Jomi, as Mijo sighed and stroked her hair. "Ugh.. Yeah, yeah.. But.. I don't know what else to do! It feels like.. uhh.. I've run out of sex ideas.. or any idea." responded Mijo as she sat up on the bed, leaning on the wall behind her.

"Sex ideas? As in.. you're growing tired of having sex? Yeah, that'll happen if you continously use your sex drive y'know? Also, also.. it's the time of year that really calls for more development outside of the sexual life, you get me? Of course, what I mean.. not necessarily family, but like.. something more meaningful?" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Mmm.. You're right. I'm.. I don't know. It's probably because of what just happened but.. I just feel less horny now.. like a whole month has passed since I came into your room." said Mijo, as she messes up her hair and looks a bit *agitated.*  

"It's been.. **thirty minutes..** Mijo.. I just.. You talked about your issues last time right? I get it, this is a way to distract, but don't you think you've been slacking off in your fighting skills? I haven't seen you in my training ground for.. four weeks. A month. You've gotten rusty, what if someone actually interrupts the all-important event next week? You're going to rely on the always ever *busy queen, me?"* said Jomi, before Mijo nodded and stretched her arms. "Yeah, yeah.. Keep remindin' me.. Jeez, now I just want to have sex again, so I can forget what's going to happen later." answered Mijo, as she straddled on top of Jomi, reigniting the flame of desire again.

"AH! Hey! I.. come on.. At least.. at least just warn me first.. again.." said Jomi, blushing, very uncomfortable about her arousal at the current situation. "Ah? You look.. um.. are you sure you want to do this?" asked Mijo, as she looked away from Jomi's gaze. "I can.. touch myself, and that'll be the same.. if you're not.." trailed off Mijo, thinking about what she was doing. "I.. don't know anymore.. I just let you.. so.. don't ruin it. Look, we've done this a lot of times before. I've just accepted it okay? Just do it." said Jomi softly as she nudged Mijo to look at her. "Huh? Is that a yes or no? Ugh.. I'll just start thenn.." said Mijo, as she started to sensually grind on Jomi's pussy again.

Mijo silently touched Jomi's breasts, as she kissed Jomi's lips, going deep as they both softly moan. Mijo pulled back, with glazed over eyes and a faint blush. "Does this feel good? Are you— ah~" said Mijo before her felt a spark at her bottom, causing her to moan softly as she kissed Jomi's neck. Mijo kissed Jomi again and soon picked up the pace, as her movements became more urgent, aggressive and desperate. Their bodies moved in a harmony that gived them both intense and great pleasure, filling the somewhat quiet bedroom. With only the air conditioning humming undeneath the various whimpers and moans of Jomi and Mijo.

They both felt getting closer to the edge, their breaths coming in short gasps. Mijo focused at the sensations, ignoring her immense burden, while Jomi was too overwhelmed to think about anything other than what's currently happening to her. Mijo eventually broke the skin, with a usual smirk that made Mijo's lips whenever she's lost in the ecstasy. "Beautiful.. so submissive, so fuckable.. responsive slut.." murmured Mijo, her breathing getting heavier. Jomi noticed this comment under the haze and muttered, "Mijo.." before Mijo touched Jomi, making her arch her back from the touch. "Ah.. this.. I.." whispered Jomi, as she closed her eyes, giving into the sensations once more.

Eventually, their movements grew more frantic as they cried louder moans that if anyone were to visit them again, they would hear them. They raced towards the climax of pleasure, as both felt a coil of heat in their belly threatening to burst. Jomi gripped Mijo's hips instinctively, her nails digging into Mijo's soft flesh, indicating to be more urgent at their movement. Mijo pulled back and grazed over her neck as she whispered, "Come.. come for me.. Feel you all over me.." whispered Mijo, her ragged breathing at Jomi's neck as they both climaxed at the same time, as Mijo moved to Jomi's lips to claim her in a bruising kiss, as they came over the edge. Both bodies in a symphony of pleasure that leave them breathless.

Mijo collapsed on Jomi, before she rolled over next to Jomi
