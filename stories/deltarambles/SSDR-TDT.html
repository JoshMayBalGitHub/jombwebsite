"Is this thing on?" asked Mijo, as he looked at the microphone that Jomi brought. "Yeah.. it's on." said Jomi, as she tapped on the microphone. "Okay.. whew. First episode.." said Mijo as he looked at the camera. "This still feels so new.. so.. weird. But whatever. Let's get this thing started. We're going to have to do a lot of prep work for later anyway, so.. Hey, Jomi.. what's on the agenda again?" said Mijo, as Jomi grabbed the notes that Mijo just scribbled before recording.

"So.. Encore? Huh.. that WuWa character? You sure you can mention her, or.." asked Jomi, before Mijo interrupted her. "Yeah, yeah.. This is completely free anyway, we don't have to be as restrictive, just talk about stuff, develop.. whatever." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Alright, go on. I'm just going to read this.. this.. whatever this is as context." continued Jomi, as Mijo cleared his throat. "Okay, so.. like, that story? 'bout stories.. and.. life is very deep to me.." said Mijo, as he touched his head then he brushed his head.

"It's something that I've been thinking about.. for a while.." said Mijo before he drank some RoyalCo. "Let me finish this. Jomi, I'm on a tight schedule this time, so.. let's just go with this and hmm.." said Mijo, before he took the note and scribbled more. "Okay, two topics. Let's finish the first one, then some opinions on the second one, then we end. I don't have time for more." said Mijo, as he drank some more RoyalCo." continued Mijo, now looking more tired by the hour.

"Okay, fine. Go. Before you turn incoherent babble in your half-asleep craze." commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Okay, so.. like, in that story, Encore and Yuni, I think? Go with this story about some three treasures.. and that gate of wishes. It reminded me of how I felt about the world sometimes, it's.. intoxicating to fall into the fictional world. But, more and more stuff keeps piling on, and the mind goes crazy. It's like, I just want to avoid it.. I can't seem to find myself doing it, while being happy.. I'm talking about school and stuff.. It's been a doozy fighting and talking about the dark world, but Imma be real with you, this feels like that world in Encore's story, feels real and fantastical but.. short-lived."

"All my life.. I've been searching for the courage to speak properly, but I never let my mind rest.. I just want to rest.. I don't know if I have thought or said this before, but I remember just being tired of being ordered around, feeling used by these military club people who think just because they're a member of some little hierarchy imposed by a mandatory non-academic club means they can be army officers in a normal science school. Right now, I feel tired.. I don't feel like I like being here, but I want to be here.. In truth, I just need proper rest. Maybe some balancing. Ways to finally express. I think I have a set goal for the next couple of days. I just.. I just hate this fucking stupid piece of shit class that I am afraid if I ever speak out on, will sacrifice this sense of reputation I keep.."

"I see.. I don't really have much to say, Mijo.. after all this is your idea of a podcast.. Just, let it out. You decided on the topics, I'm just here to be your.. guide." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and turned to face the camera. "This is going on-air no? Well, it doesn't matter.. I'm sure it wont affect my story much.. Unless someone wants it to be.." said Mijo, as he looked to a wall that seemed to break the fourth wall, but the author was unamused. "Anyways. Just, the philosophy of stories being part of life and just having to get through to survive.. Ugh. You know Jomi, maybe I should talk about CAT next time, maybe after the intramurals topic tomorrow, or actually.. next time, because I don't want this to be an obligation, cause that would ruin the point of these.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi.

"Ahaha.. True, these are simple texts, voices and cameras set up for use when needed.. But, I have a feeling you're going to make this daily, if you can?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Hopefully. But for now, crossed fingers. Anyways, I just.. back to the first topic at hand. Encore's story hurt me more than it should, because it reminded me of how attached I am, even though I don't look the part. I just feel this sense of hopelessness. That I am becoming numb even though I don't want to be. I think I need some time to reflect and talk about that military subject. That's the main issue that I need to talk about before it gets worse, like my mental state." continued Mijo, as he sat up on his chair.

"Okay! We should stop there. Let's do a quick round on the second topic before ending it off." said Jomi, as Mijo shot up and grabbed the paper, with Jomi still holding it. "Oh yeah, well.. there aren't things that I haven't said before, basically.. in conclusion, oswaldo, a very bad guy, but represents the stereotypical capitalist at work, considering their past and present. IPC is a corporation that represents a powerful capitalist country like the USA or China, wait.. is that controversial? Nevermind. Anyways, typical marxist analysis.. Look, it's very late into the night when I started this, can we just wrap this up, and I can go to bed, to start my school shit?" answered Mijo, as he stared off aimlessly.

"Sure!" said Jomi as she turned to the camera. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, before the show turned off.

"Are we live? Wait.. is this even supposed to be live, or pre-recorded?" said Mijo, as the cameras started rolling. "I think it'd be better if it was pre-recorded.. We.. uh, started the last episode at a very late time.. It's better if we go from this day forward, it's all pre-recorded." answered Jomi, as she poured over the notes that Mijo brought. "Oh, okay cool. So.. what's the quote you prepared?" asked Jomi, as Mijo widened his eyes and hurriedly looked around him. "Mother.. where's the.. Crap, must've forgotten to write it down.. Jeez.. okay, uh.. I think I remember it.. nope. I'm going to write it down first, you Jomi, introduce.. while I write." answered Mijo, as he grabbed the paper from Jomi.

"Oh.. uh.. ok? Right, my new intro.. ahem." said Jomi, as she grabbed an index card she was pocketing. "Hello! Welcome to our podcast, sort-of.. still working on that. Anyways, called The Dajovy Times! I am Jomi, co-host and the princess of the dark, Mijo.. who is writing his.. quote.. is the main host, and the lightbringer! We are also hosting two special guests! However, they're not here yet. They're saved for later, if they ever come that is. I will introduce them once they come on the show." said Jomi, before she turned to Mijo, still frantically writing.

"Oh? We're done..? Um, uh.. ok! So, our quote for today is.. oh gosh.. am I correct? Nevermind, anyways.. 'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity.' by Albert Einstein.. Oh, uh pretty smart guy, theory of relativity, he started.. Jomi, do people here know him?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head. "I know because.. complicated backstory. But, yeah.. we should move on, let's just say this Einstein guy is smart, and talk about the quote."

"Alright. So, in my opinion, this is the best quote I can make towards my current situation right now. Never stop questioning. This applies to all situations in life, or mostly.. But, for me, this applies mainly in school, not just restricted to the traditional education in it, but also the systems surrounding it, for example.. On how curriculums restrict true potential and creativity to the individuals learning. People or students there learn in spite of school, not because of it. This is also an einstein quote.. But I forgot the name.. I was searching through the quote library of him, haha.. Anyways, this ties back into the main reason for this podcast existing." said Mijo, before he took a swig of RoyalCo, orange-flavored softdrink.

"You might apply this here, why? Well, simple. I want to just lie down and air my opinions out. While still refreshing my mind on things. I mean, there's no stakes here.. For the most part, only talk and converse about whatever interests me.. If I run out, then I quit. This is just more of a therapeutic way of saying things without a stake in them, I got this from the last episode, in truth.. I just have less tolerance to judgement. I often sit around and don't do stuff because I know the pain will overwhelm me, and I don't like being depressed, of course. So, this is just a way of doing whatever." said Mijo, before he took a deep breath and drank some more RoyalCo, then water from a RoyalCo water bottle.

"Wow, that was a lot.. In my opinion? Uh.. it's definitely a way, but my concern stems from.. can you handle this, whole podcasting, recording 'thing' everyday? You..  uhm.. told me before, you break habits easily due to certain undisclosed conditions.. So you might be pressuring yourself to speak and talk more even when times are different, like today, it's been a long time since you're free for today, and I can be here too, it's just.. I'm worried you're not resting or asserting to everyone that you should  take time to rest, no matter how selfish it might seem.." commented Jomi, before she took a deep breath and drank some water.

"Okay, then.. short break time!" said Mijo, before cutting to a transition scene.

_Later, after Mijo locked himself in a room for 5 minutes_

"Okay! I got some new ideas! Lemme write it down.." said Mijo as he wrote into the paper, while Jomi was awakening from her short nap. "Huh..? Oh.. right, okay.." said Jomi, as she turned on the cameras. "Well, we're back! After.. a while, hopefully there were no issues before turning this on.. Now, back to the topics! Mijo, are you done with the quote? This is already turning into a huge episode.." said Jomi, as Mijo gave her the paper and sat down.

"It's getting shorter, trust. Like one paragraph at most. Anyways, we're done with that einstein quote, let's move on to my school ramblings! As of this.. fine 8:27 morning.. Hmm, Parol Making? I don't have much to say other than congrats to my friends JR and.. Athena for winning I guess.. Why did I write this.. oh, the country's patriotic stuff? Let's save that for the fourth topic.. Ooh! The Intramurals, well.. all I can say is, I wish I could enjoy it like before, but unfortunately.. my experience and time in SciHi has affected me as a person that I can no longer enjoy these events without feeling immense regret and guilt." said Mijo, as he took a deep breath and drank some water.

"Elaborate.. before you avoid and forget it." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Alright, well let's start.. with regret.. The happiness of the first day was cut short by the harsh restrictions during the Mr. and Ms. Intramurals pageant, unfortunately.. the rest was cut short by a storm.. two storms.. blazing through the Philippines. I also regret just.. wasting my life, even though I couldn't do anything at that time to cope with my depression and self-loathing.. But.. about the guilt.. I just feel hopeless and insecure whenever people talk about how much they did for me only for me to falter in the end. Ahaha.. You think I don't know that? Huh? Fudging muddlefudgers.. I just.. this relates to the MAPEH Stuff.. but.." said Mijo, before he took some time to catch his breath.

"This dance routine.. Do I like it? Well.. I wanted to, but no. I don't. Numero uno, the teacher is part of the military club as an advisor that makes my skin crawl whenever he appears in my view. Número dos, the intense practice and training just for a grade I won't care about.. Where would you practically use it? I like dancing, I just don't practice it much.. I am also not confident that I can do it, since.. due to the culprit of earlier progress.. Singing too, like.. 'self-expression'? Muddlefudgers! If I hear that one more time I'm going to burst! I like singing, but then I'm forced to do non-rock songs, I like dancing, but then I'm forced to do something I can't do due to my body and mind, I like arts, so much! But it takes a lot of time to practice, I just.. don't do it due to my commitments to more language based ways of expression. Health? It's been side graded.. I swear, for the life of me, Biology will teach me more about health than health. That's the only part that doesn't get much attention but still feels worse due to that teacher." said Mijo, before looking up to the ceiling, feeling drained.

"I understand.. Do you need a break?" asked Jomi as Mijo looked at her and nodded. "Okay, we'll be back after this short message!" said Jomi, before transitioning to an advertisement about RoyalCo and its products. RoyalCo is a partner with Jomi, so this is a sponsorship but with extra steps.

"And.. we're back! That was long, I guess you just needed to refresh your mind no?" asked Jomi, before Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I did. Anyways, let's tackle another huge topic, C.A.T. that piece of shirt club I call the bane of my existence, the reason I keep struggling in school. This singular piece of shirt subject should not be subjected to more people, and like what the fudge do you expect me to do? I.. just hate my life whenever tuesday appears, aside from english, C.A.T. exists as a way of fucking me up properly whenever I have a good start to my week. It's a piece of crap that needed to be removed long before I became 'eligible'. The worst part? It's basically shitty army school but for teenagers, what? Do you expect me to join the military voluntarily? No! I don't. But I don't expect everyone to not like this, but what I mean, is not all people should! Everyone should have a choice. This.. is fudging absurd, see the stupid dichotomy of a science school paired with a stupid military club, mandatory too?" said Mijo, as he stopped himself, calming himself down by drinking some RoyalCo.

"I guess, but.. what's the difference between your own swordsmanship and training compared to.. theirs? I'm just curious if.. for example, me, I have a voluntary service to protect the city, and to enforce some rules I have. But, my situation is different right? I have an existential threat always creeping up.. There are less people around than your country, and it's.. it's like.. um.. you can see like, the enemy, but in yours? You told me that it's a waste for you during your years now due to you pursuing this.. like this whole thing, and also the underlying pressure that just simmers, you get?" commented Jomi, as Mijo took a sip of water to refresh and think about what Jomi put out.

"Yeah, pretty much. The thing is, it's different in two ways, first.. I have some control of my powers here, and secondly, I'm my own master. Freedom is my most essential value, if there's no freedom, then fundamentally we simply aren't responsible for anything we do. Yours is definitely way more different, I don't see an existential threat that is easy to.. fight? Like, as in.. battles, since the more you think about the fight, the less it matters on the individual and more to the collective country. For example, here.. It's way more defined, the only issue I face is head-on, while in that place, I find only deceit and manipulation, and distrust of systems. Like I said, I hate rigidness. Change can only come from the collective work of everyone, and I know that by working with others, I can do it, but I feel much much more.. alone in my thinking outside of here." answered Mijo, before he took a deep breath, and checked his phone.

"Muddlefudgers.. Can I just add an addendum to the.. fudge! Fucking.. hold on." said Mijo, before the podcast transitioned to a blank screen for a while. After, it transitions to Mijo taking out his anger on some holograms in the training ground.

"FUCKING STUPID! ALL OF YOU! FUCK YOU!" screamed Mijo, as he was fighting with his mixed sword and scythe warfare.

"Uh.. let's.. leave him there, uh.. for a while." said Jomi, before it cut to a transition scene.

_Transitions to a shaking Mijo, as he and Jomi are a bit disheveled in their looks_

"Whew.. whew.. hold on Jomi, hold on.." said Mijo, as he drank more water. "It's alright, just calm down. Then we can finish this episode, afterwards, you can go to your MAPEH practice.." said Jomi, before Mijo clearly reacted in anger as he tried to keep himself composed. "Yeah. yeah." said Mijo, a bit strained in his voice.

"Let's move on before I have less time to finish this fudging podcast. Ok.." said Mijo, as he looked at the third topic. "My short opinion on this is that the disingenuous way of portraying change when there is no meaningful one. It is also a political move to make it a new idea in the curriculum, and the songs.. pledges.. All to serve this goal of cementing their legacy in the Philippines without making it actually better. Whatever, this is for another day, I ran out of time, these.. nevermind. Let's move on to the final and fourth one." said Mijo, a bit analytical but also hiding his anger.

"I understand. Ok, so.. Lauvielle.. she can't come today.. due to that MAPEH Practice.. same with Rhida and JR.. Looks like Ikari is available, only for a brief moment. Alright, hmm.." said Jomi, as she looked at her paper before Ikari shortly arrived. "I'm here! Woah, this.. room is now a podcast room? Okay.. so, Mijo? What did you want to talk about?" asked Ikari, as Mijo sighed and looked at her.

"The usual. Let's just get this over with, I'm feeling tired already.. I hate two things about this gaming energy system. The first is the little you spend, and get but the very long times you grind is.. a horrible system to me. Sure, it's half of the game.. But does that mean your half is just boring? Well, it's not even boring, it's like.. if you were forced to track each individual movement of paint drying for hours every day. Second, the artifacts suck. You can barely get them before adventure rank 45, then even so, the same problem of long grind times, little reward comes in, and you're left with 36+ hours spent getting a good set for a character. Okay, thoughts, you two?" asked Mijo, as both nodded and Ikari spoke out first.

"Yeah, that made me quit that game. It just sucks having to grind everyday, and it's not even that exciting. I love the events though. Characters are top notch too, just the gameplay man.." answered Ikari, as Jomi added. "Yeah, the gameplay is another thing, the energy system would be more tolerable if it was good. Unfortunately, as seen in Wuthering Waves, the game cannot keep up with gameplay in terms of open-world gacha due to the barebones mechanics beyond elemental resonance and reactions, which some are locked with specific non-free characters." Mijo and Jomi both took a sip of RoyalCo.

"Jomi, start the outro.." said Mijo, as he prepared himself. "Sure!" acknowledged Jomi as she cleared her throat. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, as they turn to Ikari.

"Oh? Uh.. like they said. Bye!" said Ikari as the camera was on her before the cameras turned off.

### Addendum:

"Whew.. I managed to add this before the upload.. Okay, so.. you know that addendum? Yeah, I'm here. So, what I wanted to say is the MAPEH Practice in retrospect, it's just.. it's meh. Without the suspects, those being wannabe military officers and.. just in general officers of those scout clubs, it's easier to navigate. Of course, this is also considering their leniency to me, which is fine.. I'd take everything I can get. Anyways, if you hear outlandish and confrontational writing.. Sorry about that, it's just a guy expressing his frustration in the world. Point still stands though, just ignore my intense hatred." said Mijo, before smiling for a while then turning off the camera.
