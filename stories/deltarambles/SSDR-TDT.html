"Is this thing on?" asked Mijo, as he looked at the microphone that Jomi brought. "Yeah.. it's on." said Jomi, as she tapped on the microphone. "Okay.. whew. First episode.." said Mijo as he looked at the camera. "This still feels so new.. so.. weird. But whatever. Let's get this thing started. We're going to have to do a lot of prep work for later anyway, so.. Hey, Jomi.. what's on the agenda again?" said Mijo, as Jomi grabbed the notes that Mijo just scribbled before recording.

"So.. Encore? Huh.. that WuWa character? You sure you can mention her, or.." asked Jomi, before Mijo interrupted her. "Yeah, yeah.. This is completely free anyway, we don't have to be as restrictive, just talk about stuff, develop.. whatever." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Alright, go on. I'm just going to read this.. this.. whatever this is as context." continued Jomi, as Mijo cleared his throat. "Okay, so.. like, that story? 'bout stories.. and.. life is very deep to me.." said Mijo, as he touched his head then he brushed his head.

"It's something that I've been thinking about.. for a while.." said Mijo before he drank some RoyalCo. "Let me finish this. Jomi, I'm on a tight schedule this time, so.. let's just go with this and hmm.." said Mijo, before he took the note and scribbled more. "Okay, two topics. Let's finish the first one, then some opinions on the second one, then we end. I don't have time for more." said Mijo, as he drank some more RoyalCo." continued Mijo, now looking more tired by the hour.

"Okay, fine. Go. Before you turn incoherent babble in your half-asleep craze." commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Okay, so.. like, in that story, Encore and Yuni, I think? Go with this story about some three treasures.. and that gate of wishes. It reminded me of how I felt about the world sometimes, it's.. intoxicating to fall into the fictional world. But, more and more stuff keeps piling on, and the mind goes crazy. It's like, I just want to avoid it.. I can't seem to find myself doing it, while being happy.. I'm talking about school and stuff.. It's been a doozy fighting and talking about the dark world, but Imma be real with you, this feels like that world in Encore's story, feels real and fantastical but.. short-lived."

"All my life.. I've been searching for the courage to speak properly, but I never let my mind rest.. I just want to rest.. I don't know if I have thought or said this before, but I remember just being tired of being ordered around, feeling used by these military club people who think just because they're a member of some little hierarchy imposed by a mandatory non-academic club means they can be army officers in a normal science school. Right now, I feel tired.. I don't feel like I like being here, but I want to be here.. In truth, I just need proper rest. Maybe some balancing. Ways to finally express. I think I have a set goal for the next couple of days. I just.. I just hate this fucking stupid piece of shit class that I am afraid if I ever speak out on, will sacrifice this sense of reputation I keep.."

"I see.. I don't really have much to say, Mijo.. after all this is your idea of a podcast.. Just, let it out. You decided on the topics, I'm just here to be your.. guide." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and turned to face the camera. "This is going on-air no? Well, it doesn't matter.. I'm sure it wont affect my story much.. Unless someone wants it to be.." said Mijo, as he looked to a wall that seemed to break the fourth wall, but the author was unamused. "Anyways. Just, the philosophy of stories being part of life and just having to get through to survive.. Ugh. You know Jomi, maybe I should talk about CAT next time, maybe after the intramurals topic tomorrow, or actually.. next time, because I don't want this to be an obligation, cause that would ruin the point of these.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi.

"Ahaha.. True, these are simple texts, voices and cameras set up for use when needed.. But, I have a feeling you're going to make this daily, if you can?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Hopefully. But for now, crossed fingers. Anyways, I just.. back to the first topic at hand. Encore's story hurt me more than it should, because it reminded me of how attached I am, even though I don't look the part. I just feel this sense of hopelessness. That I am becoming numb even though I don't want to be. I think I need some time to reflect and talk about that military subject. That's the main issue that I need to talk about before it gets worse, like my mental state." continued Mijo, as he sat up on his chair.

"Okay! We should stop there. Let's do a quick round on the second topic before ending it off." said Jomi, as Mijo shot up and grabbed the paper, with Jomi still holding it. "Oh yeah, well.. there aren't things that I haven't said before, basically.. in conclusion, oswaldo, a very bad guy, but represents the stereotypical capitalist at work, considering their past and present. IPC is a corporation that represents a powerful capitalist country like the USA or China, wait.. is that controversial? Nevermind. Anyways, typical marxist analysis.. Look, it's very late into the night when I started this, can we just wrap this up, and I can go to bed, to start my school shit?" answered Mijo, as he stared off aimlessly.

"Sure!" said Jomi as she turned to the camera. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, before the show turned off.
