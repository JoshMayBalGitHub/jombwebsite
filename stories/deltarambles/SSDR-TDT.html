"Is this thing on?" asked Mijo, as he looked at the microphone that Jomi brought. "Yeah.. it's on." said Jomi, as she tapped on the microphone. "Okay.. whew. First episode.." said Mijo as he looked at the camera. "This still feels so new.. so.. weird. But whatever. Let's get this thing started. We're going to have to do a lot of prep work for later anyway, so.. Hey, Jomi.. what's on the agenda again?" said Mijo, as Jomi grabbed the notes that Mijo just scribbled before recording.

"So.. Encore? Huh.. that WuWa character? You sure you can mention her, or.." asked Jomi, before Mijo interrupted her. "Yeah, yeah.. This is completely free anyway, we don't have to be as restrictive, just talk about stuff, develop.. whatever." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Alright, go on. I'm just going to read this.. this.. whatever this is as context." continued Jomi, as Mijo cleared his throat. "Okay, so.. like, that story? 'bout stories.. and.. life is very deep to me.." said Mijo, as he touched his head then he brushed his head.

"It's something that I've been thinking about.. for a while.." said Mijo before he drank some RoyalCo. "Let me finish this. Jomi, I'm on a tight schedule this time, so.. let's just go with this and hmm.." said Mijo, before he took the note and scribbled more. "Okay, two topics. Let's finish the first one, then some opinions on the second one, then we end. I don't have time for more." said Mijo, as he drank some more RoyalCo." continued Mijo, now looking more tired by the hour.

"Okay, fine. Go. Before you turn incoherent babble in your half-asleep craze." commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Okay, so.. like, in that story, Encore and Yuni, I think? Go with this story about some three treasures.. and that gate of wishes. It reminded me of how I felt about the world sometimes, it's.. intoxicating to fall into the fictional world. But, more and more stuff keeps piling on, and the mind goes crazy. It's like, I just want to avoid it.. I can't seem to find myself doing it, while being happy.. I'm talking about school and stuff.. It's been a doozy fighting and talking about the dark world, but Imma be real with you, this feels like that world in Encore's story, feels real and fantastical but.. short-lived."

"All my life.. I've been searching for the courage to speak properly, but I never let my mind rest.. I just want to rest.. I don't know if I have thought or said this before, but I remember just being tired of being ordered around, feeling used by these military club people who think just because they're a member of some little hierarchy imposed by a mandatory non-academic club means they can be army officers in a normal science school. Right now, I feel tired.. I don't feel like I like being here, but I want to be here.. In truth, I just need proper rest. Maybe some balancing. Ways to finally express. I think I have a set goal for the next couple of days. I just.. I just hate this fucking stupid piece of shit class that I am afraid if I ever speak out on, will sacrifice this sense of reputation I keep.."

"I see.. I don't really have much to say, Mijo.. after all this is your idea of a podcast.. Just, let it out. You decided on the topics, I'm just here to be your.. guide." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and turned to face the camera. "This is going on-air no? Well, it doesn't matter.. I'm sure it wont affect my story much.. Unless someone wants it to be.." said Mijo, as he looked to a wall that seemed to break the fourth wall, but the author was unamused. "Anyways. Just, the philosophy of stories being part of life and just having to get through to survive.. Ugh. You know Jomi, maybe I should talk about CAT next time, maybe after the intramurals topic tomorrow, or actually.. next time, because I don't want this to be an obligation, cause that would ruin the point of these.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi.

"Ahaha.. True, these are simple texts, voices and cameras set up for use when needed.. But, I have a feeling you're going to make this daily, if you can?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Hopefully. But for now, crossed fingers. Anyways, I just.. back to the first topic at hand. Encore's story hurt me more than it should, because it reminded me of how attached I am, even though I don't look the part. I just feel this sense of hopelessness. That I am becoming numb even though I don't want to be. I think I need some time to reflect and talk about that military subject. That's the main issue that I need to talk about before it gets worse, like my mental state." continued Mijo, as he sat up on his chair.

"Okay! We should stop there. Let's do a quick round on the second topic before ending it off." said Jomi, as Mijo shot up and grabbed the paper, with Jomi still holding it. "Oh yeah, well.. there aren't things that I haven't said before, basically.. in conclusion, oswaldo, a very bad guy, but represents the stereotypical capitalist at work, considering their past and present. IPC is a corporation that represents a powerful capitalist country like the USA or China, wait.. is that controversial? Nevermind. Anyways, typical marxist analysis.. Look, it's very late into the night when I started this, can we just wrap this up, and I can go to bed, to start my school shit?" answered Mijo, as he stared off aimlessly.

"Sure!" said Jomi as she turned to the camera. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, before the show turned off.

"Are we live? Wait.. is this even supposed to be live, or pre-recorded?" said Mijo, as the cameras started rolling. "I think it'd be better if it was pre-recorded.. We.. uh, started the last episode at a very late time.. It's better if we go from this day forward, it's all pre-recorded." answered Jomi, as she poured over the notes that Mijo brought. "Oh, okay cool. So.. what's the quote you prepared?" asked Jomi, as Mijo widened his eyes and hurriedly looked around him. "Mother.. where's the.. Crap, must've forgotten to write it down.. Jeez.. okay, uh.. I think I remember it.. nope. I'm going to write it down first, you Jomi, introduce.. while I write." answered Mijo, as he grabbed the paper from Jomi.

"Oh.. uh.. ok? Right, my new intro.. ahem." said Jomi, as she grabbed an index card she was pocketing. "Hello! Welcome to our podcast, sort-of.. still working on that. Anyways, called The Dajovy Times! I am Jomi, co-host and the princess of the dark, Mijo.. who is writing his.. quote.. is the main host, and the lightbringer! We are also hosting two special guests! However, they're not here yet. They're saved for later, if they ever come that is. I will introduce them once they come on the show." said Jomi, before she turned to Mijo, still frantically writing.

"Oh? We're done..? Um, uh.. ok! So, our quote for today is.. oh gosh.. am I correct? Nevermind, anyways.. 'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity.' by Albert Einstein.. Oh, uh pretty smart guy, theory of relativity, he started.. Jomi, do people here know him?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head. "I know because.. complicated backstory. But, yeah.. we should move on, let's just say this Einstein guy is smart, and talk about the quote."

"Alright. So, in my opinion, this is the best quote I can make towards my current situation right now. Never stop questioning. This applies to all situations in life, or mostly.. But, for me, this applies mainly in school, not just restricted to the traditional education in it, but also the systems surrounding it, for example.. On how curriculums restrict true potential and creativity to the individuals learning. People or students there learn in spite of school, not because of it. This is also an einstein quote.. But I forgot the name.. I was searching through the quote library of him, haha.. Anyways, this ties back into the main reason for this podcast existing." said Mijo, before he took a swig of RoyalCo, orange-flavored softdrink.

"You might apply this here, why? Well, simple. I want to just lie down and air my opinions out. While still refreshing my mind on things. I mean, there's no stakes here.. For the most part, only talk and converse about whatever interests me.. If I run out, then I quit. This is just more of a therapeutic way of saying things without a stake in them, I got this from the last episode, in truth.. I just have less tolerance to judgement. I often sit around and don't do stuff because I know the pain will overwhelm me, and I don't like being depressed, of course. So, this is just a way of doing whatever." said Mijo, before he took a deep breath and drank some more RoyalCo, then water from a RoyalCo water bottle.

"Wow, that was a lot.. In my opinion? Uh.. it's definitely a way, but my concern stems from.. can you handle this, whole podcasting, recording 'thing' everyday? You..  uhm.. told me before, you break habits easily due to certain undisclosed conditions.. So you might be pressuring yourself to speak and talk more even when times are different, like today, it's been a long time since you're free for today, and I can be here too, it's just.. I'm worried you're not resting or asserting to everyone that you should  take time to rest, no matter how selfish it might seem.." commented Jomi, before she took a deep breath and drank some water.

"Okay, then.. short break time!" said Mijo, before cutting to a transition scene.

_Later, after Mijo locked himself in a room for 5 minutes_

"Okay! I got some new ideas! Lemme write it down.." said Mijo as he wrote into the paper, while Jomi was awakening from her short nap. "Huh..? Oh.. right, okay.." said Jomi, as she turned on the cameras. "Well, we're back! After.. a while, hopefully there were no issues before turning this on.. Now, back to the topics! Mijo, are you done with the quote? This is already turning into a huge episode.." said Jomi, as Mijo gave her the paper and sat down.

"It's getting shorter, trust. Like one paragraph at most. Anyways, we're done with that einstein quote, let's move on to my school ramblings! As of this.. fine 8:27 morning.. Hmm, Parol Making? I don't have much to say other than congrats to my friends JR and.. Athena for winning I guess.. Why did I write this.. oh, the country's patriotic stuff? Let's save that for the fourth topic.. Ooh! The Intramurals, well.. all I can say is, I wish I could enjoy it like before, but unfortunately.. my experience and time in SciHi has affected me as a person that I can no longer enjoy these events without feeling immense regret and guilt." said Mijo, as he took a deep breath and drank some water.

"Elaborate.. before you avoid and forget it." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Alright, well let's start.. with regret.. The happiness of the first day was cut short by the harsh restrictions during the Mr. and Ms. Intramurals pageant, unfortunately.. the rest was cut short by a storm.. two storms.. blazing through the Philippines. I also regret just.. wasting my life, even though I couldn't do anything at that time to cope with my depression and self-loathing.. But.. about the guilt.. I just feel hopeless and insecure whenever people talk about how much they did for me only for me to falter in the end. Ahaha.. You think I don't know that? Huh? Fudging muddlefudgers.. I just.. this relates to the MAPEH Stuff.. but.." said Mijo, before he took some time to catch his breath.

"This dance routine.. Do I like it? Well.. I wanted to, but no. I don't. Numero uno, the teacher is part of the military club as an advisor that makes my skin crawl whenever he appears in my view. Número dos, the intense practice and training just for a grade I won't care about.. Where would you practically use it? I like dancing, I just don't practice it much.. I am also not confident that I can do it, since.. due to the culprit of earlier progress.. Singing too, like.. 'self-expression'? Muddlefudgers! If I hear that one more time I'm going to burst! I like singing, but then I'm forced to do non-rock songs, I like dancing, but then I'm forced to do something I can't do due to my body and mind, I like arts, so much! But it takes a lot of time to practice, I just.. don't do it due to my commitments to more language based ways of expression. Health? It's been side graded.. I swear, for the life of me, Biology will teach me more about health than health. That's the only part that doesn't get much attention but still feels worse due to that teacher." said Mijo, before looking up to the ceiling, feeling drained.

"I understand.. Do you need a break?" asked Jomi as Mijo looked at her and nodded. "Okay, we'll be back after this short message!" said Jomi, before transitioning to an advertisement about RoyalCo and its products. RoyalCo is a partner with Jomi, so this is a sponsorship but with extra steps.

"And.. we're back! That was long, I guess you just needed to refresh your mind no?" asked Jomi, before Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I did. Anyways, let's tackle another huge topic, C.A.T. that piece of shirt club I call the bane of my existence, the reason I keep struggling in school. This singular piece of shirt subject should not be subjected to more people, and like what the fudge do you expect me to do? I.. just hate my life whenever tuesday appears, aside from english, C.A.T. exists as a way of fucking me up properly whenever I have a good start to my week. It's a piece of crap that needed to be removed long before I became 'eligible'. The worst part? It's basically shitty army school but for teenagers, what? Do you expect me to join the military voluntarily? No! I don't. But I don't expect everyone to not like this, but what I mean, is not all people should! Everyone should have a choice. This.. is fudging absurd, see the stupid dichotomy of a science school paired with a stupid military club, mandatory too?" said Mijo, as he stopped himself, calming himself down by drinking some RoyalCo.

"I guess, but.. what's the difference between your own swordsmanship and training compared to.. theirs? I'm just curious if.. for example, me, I have a voluntary service to protect the city, and to enforce some rules I have. But, my situation is different right? I have an existential threat always creeping up.. There are less people around than your country, and it's.. it's like.. um.. you can see like, the enemy, but in yours? You told me that it's a waste for you during your years now due to you pursuing this.. like this whole thing, and also the underlying pressure that just simmers, you get?" commented Jomi, as Mijo took a sip of water to refresh and think about what Jomi put out.

"Yeah, pretty much. The thing is, it's different in two ways, first.. I have some control of my powers here, and secondly, I'm my own master. Freedom is my most essential value, if there's no freedom, then fundamentally we simply aren't responsible for anything we do. Yours is definitely way more different, I don't see an existential threat that is easy to.. fight? Like, as in.. battles, since the more you think about the fight, the less it matters on the individual and more to the collective country. For example, here.. It's way more defined, the only issue I face is head-on, while in that place, I find only deceit and manipulation, and distrust of systems. Like I said, I hate rigidness. Change can only come from the collective work of everyone, and I know that by working with others, I can do it, but I feel much much more.. alone in my thinking outside of here." answered Mijo, before he took a deep breath, and checked his phone.

"Muddlefudgers.. Can I just add an addendum to the.. fudge! Fucking.. hold on." said Mijo, before the podcast transitioned to a blank screen for a while. After, it transitions to Mijo taking out his anger on some holograms in the training ground.

"FUCKING STUPID! ALL OF YOU! FUCK YOU!" screamed Mijo, as he was fighting with his mixed sword and scythe warfare.

"Uh.. let's.. leave him there, uh.. for a while." said Jomi, before it cut to a transition scene.

_Transitions to a shaking Mijo, as he and Jomi are a bit disheveled in their looks_

"Whew.. whew.. hold on Jomi, hold on.." said Mijo, as he drank more water. "It's alright, just calm down. Then we can finish this episode, afterwards, you can go to your MAPEH practice.." said Jomi, before Mijo clearly reacted in anger as he tried to keep himself composed. "Yeah. yeah." said Mijo, a bit strained in his voice.

"Let's move on before I have less time to finish this fudging podcast. Ok.." said Mijo, as he looked at the third topic. "My short opinion on this is that the disingenuous way of portraying change when there is no meaningful one. It is also a political move to make it a new idea in the curriculum, and the songs.. pledges.. All to serve this goal of cementing their legacy in the Philippines without making it actually better. Whatever, this is for another day, I ran out of time, these.. nevermind. Let's move on to the final and fourth one." said Mijo, a bit analytical but also hiding his anger.

"I understand. Ok, so.. Lauvielle.. she can't come today.. due to that MAPEH Practice.. same with Rhida and JR.. Looks like Ikari is available, only for a brief moment. Alright, hmm.." said Jomi, as she looked at her paper before Ikari shortly arrived. "I'm here! Woah, this.. room is now a podcast room? Okay.. so, Mijo? What did you want to talk about?" asked Ikari, as Mijo sighed and looked at her.

"The usual. Let's just get this over with, I'm feeling tired already.. I hate two things about this gaming energy system. The first is the little you spend, and get but the very long times you grind is.. a horrible system to me. Sure, it's half of the game.. But does that mean your half is just boring? Well, it's not even boring, it's like.. if you were forced to track each individual movement of paint drying for hours every day. Second, the artifacts suck. You can barely get them before adventure rank 45, then even so, the same problem of long grind times, little reward comes in, and you're left with 36+ hours spent getting a good set for a character. Okay, thoughts, you two?" asked Mijo, as both nodded and Ikari spoke out first.

"Yeah, that made me quit that game. It just sucks having to grind everyday, and it's not even that exciting. I love the events though. Characters are top notch too, just the gameplay man.." answered Ikari, as Jomi added. "Yeah, the gameplay is another thing, the energy system would be more tolerable if it was good. Unfortunately, as seen in Wuthering Waves, the game cannot keep up with gameplay in terms of open-world gacha due to the barebones mechanics beyond elemental resonance and reactions, which some are locked with specific non-free characters." Mijo and Jomi both took a sip of RoyalCo.

"Jomi, start the outro.." said Mijo, as he prepared himself. "Sure!" acknowledged Jomi as she cleared her throat. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, as they turn to Ikari.

"Oh? Uh.. like they said. Bye!" said Ikari as the camera was on her before the cameras turned off.

### Addendum:

"Whew.. I managed to add this before the upload.. Okay, so.. you know that addendum? Yeah, I'm here. So, what I wanted to say is the MAPEH Practice in retrospect, it's just.. it's meh. Without the suspects, those being wannabe military officers and.. just in general officers of those scout clubs, it's easier to navigate. Of course, this is also considering their leniency to me, which is fine.. I'd take everything I can get. Anyways, if you hear outlandish and confrontational writing.. Sorry about that, it's just a guy expressing his frustration in the world. Point still stands though, just ignore my intense hatred." said Mijo, before smiling for a while then turning off the camera.

"Mijo.. are you fine?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shook his head. "No!! No. No. No. I am not!! I'm.. so.. fudging on edge.. right now, if I see anyone else's face right now.. I am going to burst." said Mijo, as he looked at the camera. "Just fucking start it." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded.

"Hello! Welcome to our podcast, sort-of.. still working on that. Anyways, called The Dajovy Times! I am Jomi, co-host and the princess of the dark, Mijo.. who.. is.. clearly agitated.. is the main host, and the lightbringer! This one doesn't have anyone coming on, as Mijo specifically requested. Now, let's go with the podcast!" said Jomi, as she looked at Mijo, very concerned.

"What? Yeah I'm here. First topic.. ADHD.." Mijo trailed off, as he is visibly hesitant, while being on edge. "I wrote this didn't I? I don't remember, but probably late night.. HORSE RADISH stuff.. AAAHHH!" screamed Mijo, as Jomi visibly went to her partner and tried to calm him down. "Deep breaths, Mijo. Just remember.. I'm here. We're continuing this whenever you want just say so." said Jomi, as Mijo is visibly torn between pushing her away and embracing her. "I.. just.. shut.. the fudge up.. I need to think.." said Mijo, as he looked away. "Mijo.. I.. ok, um.. we'll be right back.. after this transition scene!" said Jomi, before a transition scene played.

_5 minutes later, after Mijo locked himself away in a room again_

"Mijo.. you're back! I was.. dozing off.. I.. just.. these episodes are so inconsistent in recordings.. sometimes they're at after school hours, at others.. late at night sessions.. I'm sorry.. if that affected you Mijo." said Jomi, as Mijo sat down and nodded. "I know. I should be doing something very important right now, but I just.. I just CAN'T! No matter how much I try there's this fight in my head, especially.. especially.. with.. other people around I just don't like other people around me whenever I work.. sometimes? I don't know! Maybe in these rush and half-asleep situations? I always said, at night I'm at my worst." said Mijo, as he started feeling sleepy, with only the anger and guilt keeping him from going to sleep.

"I understand. I guess I just don't know what it is to experience rush times like these.. without.. significant help, like what I mean is for example, when I have let's say a major government project due, I usually have a bunch of people working, while I manage. I also have given myself less 'work' to do. So, that's probably conflict at it again. Plus, it's not like you can decide to pass stuff right? In here, the deadlines are more manageable and visible. That's.. uh what I'm getting at." said Jomi, as Mijo clenched his fists in anger. "I..! Mijo.. I don't.. intend to hurt you.. I just, explained what I do in my situation.." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and glared at her.

"Uhuh. I'm going. Be back in an hour." said Mijo , before leaving still clearly agitated and tired. "Wait! Don't tell me you're.. ok.. he's uh.. finishing his schoolwork first.. We'll be right back after this short break, hehe.." said Jomi, before a transition scene happened.

_An hour later.._

"Jomi.." said Mijo as Jomi was woken up. Jomi was speaking incoherently before Mijo sat down and almost slapped Jomi, before she stopped it. "Hey! Mijo! I am awake.. Jeez.. you're really hitting a woman, and a princess in recording?" said Jomi, before Mijo nodded, but then quickly fell asleep.

"Mijo.. come on.. well, I'm sleepy too.. must've been exhausted. This makes sense." said Jomi as she yawned. "Well, listeners.. we'll see you in the next scene.." said Jomi, before the scene transitioned.

_15 hours later.._

"Oh, it's on again?" asked Mijo as he looked at the camera. "Yep. Are you feeling better?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah.. for now at least. Just.. hmm.. it's fine. It's the same problems I've already talked about just last epiosde. You know, the C.A.T thing. Let's put that aside for now and talk about something more fundamental to me than external factors." said Mijo, as he took a huge breath and fixed his non-existent collar.

"Hey, huh? Don't you.. nevermind. I mean, your actual coat is right outside the camera.." said Jomi, as Mijo looked at her with a smile. "Ahaha.. I know, it's for dramatic effect. Anywho, I just need to relax myself a little." said Mijo, as he grabbed his RoyalCo orange-flavored softdrink. "Alright, whatever. We're not running out of time.. at least for now, so take your time. Hmm.. should we.. what should we talk about..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo thought about it, while looking at the camera.

"Ooh! Let me grab that paper." said Mijo as he grabbed the paper and scribbled something. "There. I changed the order. Let's move the heavy stuff for later. Let's talk about Public Speaking!" said Mijo, as he stared off, regrouping his thoughts. "Public Speaking, okay.. so what I think about this is just.. sometimes, it's easy for me, and at others, a chaotic mess. I often spoke like this, as in me by myself to a camera or a rubber-duckie. What's that called again?" said Mijo, as he thought about it.

"I think I've read about it on those books you gave me for programming.. Rubber-ducking? As in 'Programmers talk to inanimate objects, like rubber ducks for example, to clarify their thoughts and debug problems.. This is called rubber-ducking, it's a way of indirectly getting new ways to solve a problem, by teaching someone on how to.' I guess it counts, I mean.. cameras exists. We're doing that right now, if it wasn't a duo podcast." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Hah, that's funny.. considering I used a rubber duckie as an example. Anyways, let's move on." said Mijo, as he drank some RoyalCo.

"Alright, so.. what does that mean? Well, it means that I basically can't take overwhelming stimuli sometimes. Hmm.. I think especially in social situations, if I'm not comfortable. I.. think this is some form of some anxiety but I can't tell if it's autism or some other form of mental disorder but.. it sure is interesting. I mean, I try to talk properly to other people like right now, but.. yeah it does feel like it takes a lot of energy out of me and.. is that related to my irritability whenever I get disturbed in my alone time?" continued Mijo, as he looked at his drink a bit closer than before.

"Hmmm.. Maybe. I can't.. uh.. well, I can. That's why.. I'm speaking about it. I.. uh.. also realize that the isolation I want whenever I get overwhelmed, is pretty much just because I don't like being overstimulated..? But, I always have intense fights in the dark world.. I wonder why that didn't manifest? I'm confused about the.. speeches too.. I have been.. speaking with my friends for a while, even new darkners.. I can seem to never get that self-confidence and charisma outside of here." said Mijo as he looked at the camera, with a thoughtful look.

"I've always wondered that. Wouldn't you get more confident if you spoke to people?" asked Jomi, as Mijo turned to Jomi, narrowing his eyes. "It's weird. I just don't know how to fix it.. Hmm, is it dependent on how confident as in base power? Maybe its rooted in the school environment versus your fantastical world? I'm not sure yet." said Mijo, as he shaked his head and waved his hand. "Whatever the case may be.. I am not sure yet, and we still have a lot more topics to cover. We have already transitioned to Neurodivergency with this topic.." said Mijo, as he took a sip of RoyalCo.

"Man.. I don't want to do these.. I want to... oh! Let me grab that." said Mijo, as he scribbled on the paper. "Move this trauma topic here.. let's.. ooh! There's gotta be a new rant for the CAT. I can never do one of these without raving on these authoritarian demagogues. Hmm.. am I using that correctly..? How about.. authoritarian wannabes? Okay, that sounds more destructive to their egos. Anyway, that just reminded me of this.. Oh, yeah right. I mentioned I didn't want any guests.. I think? But, for this part.. I rescind that. Rhida, come in!" said Mijo, as Jomi looked around but saw no one enter.

"Oh.. uh.  right.. She's probably chilling somewhere waiting for my message, um.. Okay, uh.. transition time!" said Mijo, before the camera suddenly cuts out. 

"Mijo.. did you have to suddenly cut the video feed? Well, Rhida's here. Say hi!" said Jomi, as Mijo was going back to his seat after turning on the camera. "Hello everyone! I'm Rhida, friend of Jomi and.. uh.. also friend of Mijo!" said Rhida, with a smile, while waving at the camera. "Reckless.. yes.. but whatever. I'll be better next time. Anyways.. hmm.. Rhida, are you ready to witness my ramble and rants about CAT?" said Mijo, as he looked at Rhida, looking hesitant. "Uh.. um.. sure.. I just hope you don't go too hard on them, they're just like us, teens.. They might just.. gravitate there, me? No.. but, my friends are part of similar ones, you know the ones, the other scouting clubs." responded Rhida, as Mijo nodded.

"I understand. That is where I actually want to start, so.. listen for a while." said Mijo, as he drank some water and licked his lips. "Okay, okay." said Rhida, as Jomi nodded in acknowledgement. "So, CAT.. this hot subject, my bane of existence. There's more to it than what I've mentioned. First, I just wanna say, I really don't like how it instills this aggressive and loud forcefulness to make someone do something. It's.. it's.. too reflective of what I fear in myself, as well as what I hate the most in any subject or topic. I realized this earlier. Before I went inside this podcast for the third time. I just hate being forced to do this or that, and I value freedom more than some people, and that is how my perspective is shaped. This means anything that requires obedience and submissiveness to a forceful entity.. It's just not for me.." said Mijo, as he drank some water.

"Mijo.. so, our.. um.. private talk.. you didn't tell me.." said Rhida before Mijo quickly responded. "Don't get me wrong. It's.. it's different from my.. so-called private 'sexual' fantasies. It's.. it's different. Anything I think about there, I won't ever do. Just, Rhida.. even if we have roles there, the point is to have free will in enjoying how you bond with your partner." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded. "Ah.. I get it.. thanks, Mijo." said Rhida before Mijo and her kissed off-screen.

"No problem... Let's continue with the rant, secondly.. I hate how.. so-called collective guilt is implemented in the subject. Just because they made a mistake or I made a mistake means the entire section.. ugh.. suffers. Whatever they want to do to us.. I don't wanna say, since I don't know.. But just thinking about it.. I admit, I have taken a lot of damage in this dark world, but.. being so.. powerless there outside here, experiencing being ordered around, and all I can do is accept it? How fudging convenient for them." said Mijo, as he drinks water, before looking at Rhida. "I.. find that these officers act like every.. student, I'm not calling us 'cadets'. Every student is supposed to be the perfect soldier, always following the formation, etiquettes, and orders like an obedient robot. So whenever something or someone is different, they suffer or that something is removed. If they allow accommodations for physically unfit people, i.e. people with asthma, high blood pressure.. What's the point in keeping this subject existing? It's just another cancer that comes from the huge problem that is the entirety of the school system." Mijo brushed his hair, as he  looked away, looking sad.

Rhida and Jomi are both silent, as Mijo recollects his thoughts. "Let's get the heavier ones out of the way now." said Mijo, as he drank some RoyalCo. "Trauma.. let's talk about it. First, C-PTSD.. what is it? Well, as the acronym implies, it's complex. The main thing is, it's supposed to be for repeated exposure to traumatic events, that involves usually interpersonal stuff.. Basically, a hostile environment that can make someone erratic or dissociate. I.. don't think I have this, or.. at least I don't believe having it as much as the neurodivergent stuff. But, it can provide context to how I react to stuff that.. well, hurts me." said Mijo, as he drank water while Jomi brought out more.

"The whole.. like emotional dysregulation and dissociation thing especially. As you've seen Jomi, and Rhida.. I have.. bad moments of anger and rage.. as well as self-loathing and self-harm ways..  But, the more silent and not obvious is dissociation. I don't know about this one either.. but sometimes.. I just.. give up. I detach myself from reality and try to live comfortably in my mind while the world outside burns.. I just.. shut down, and try to reboot, as my mind hazes and fogs. I.. think this happened earlier.. I just.. wish that my trauma isn't that bad." said Mijo, before Jomi and Rhida pulled him into a group hug. He quickly embraces it and they continue for a while, before pulling back, Rhida flushing a bit.

"Alright. Heavy stuff over.. Let's go on with the last topic. Because oh boy.. I'm getting tired.." said Mijo, as he laid back on his chair.  "Oh, okay. Well, Rhida?" asked Jomi before whispering to her the topic. "What is Love..? Uh.. hey! I... um.. don't.. know much about this.. But.. uh.. I guess I can.. say my experience?" said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo. "Mhm. Go ahead. Just, anonymize the other details, let them figure it out for themselves." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded. 

"Okay, I get it. Um, so.. my experience goes like this.. It's like.. uh.. there was this boy.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo before looking away. "Seems pretty weird. But.. uh.. I.. just so happen to like tall and smart people.. So, I wanted to talk to him. But, as soon as I was.. ahem.. 'convinced' by my friends to talk to him, I uh.. faltered. Can't even get a good look on him without getting all flustered and awkward. So.. every day.. I try to.. um.. muster the courage.. But, uh.. I wasn't sure if he was reciprocating.. So, it got more and more obvious.. But he still displayed mixed signals.. He seemed flustered whenever we are nearby.. But, he also seems.. too friendly to me to take me for anything other than a friend.. I uh.. um.. At that time, I don't know if all the things he was doing was an attempt by him for me, or random stuff he usually does.. It's.. just teenage love I guess. But um.. let's just say, something happened.. and.. it was a tumultous time after that. After that, I couldn't see him much again, and the school stuff.. well.. I had to move on right? But, then.. um.. after a few.. events, I.. got what I wanted.. All the confusion and.. awkwardness slowly started to fade with.. talking. But.. well.. it's just.. it hasn't finished yet.." said Rhida before she grabbed Mijo's RoyalCo.

"Hey!" said Mijo, before they playfully fought over the bottle. "Come on, Mijo..! It's just a sip.. I'm sure you won't mind, right?" said Rhida, as she winked at Mijo. "Haha, no! But, get your own! Jomi..!" said Mijo as Jomi laughed at the two. "Yeah, yeah.. I'm getting more.." said Jomi as she left to get more drinks. "Hmph, fine, Rhida. Take it, I'll just wait for Jomi then." said Mijo, as Rhida takes it and drinks it, emptying it. "Whew.. these few times I drink softdrinks.. Eh, Mijo? I was getting thirsty over our.. fight, so... ahahaa.." said Rhida, as she looked at Jomi bringing back more water bottles and RoyalCo.

"Well, I'll let you two enjoy your remaining time, I'll end off the episode here." said Jomi, looking at the two, before sitting down.

"Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that probably should be reviewed.. and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, as Rhida added, "Don't forget to hydrate!" with a wink, before the camera turned off.

"Is this live.. okay.. let's start.." said Mijo, as he looks pretty tired. "Hello! Welcome to our podcast, sort-of.. still working on that. Anyways, called The Dajovy Times! I am Jomi, co-host and the princess of the dark, Mijo.. whom is barely awake.. is the main host, and the lightbringer! This one doesn't have anyone coming on, yet. But hopefully it'll still be entertaining! Now, let's go with the podcast!" said Jomi, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh? Uh.. hmm.. oh yeah. That election. What's it about? BLU versus RED? Woman vs Man? Uh.. oh right. I'm supposed to say something. Well, I don't live in it, duh. I don't think most of you care, and if you do.. You probably don't need me to tell you what your reaction is supposed to be. You're either very sad right now, or very ecstatic.. Either way, all I can say as a non-participant is.. um.. good luck? Whether you're a hesitant democrat voter, or a fervent trump supporter, which by the way.. I don't know why any somewhat to the right watch this podcast, I will not specify what I believe, but it is almost definitely obvious. Just, try to not die, ok? Hope your country.. hmm.. well, anything I say will be used against me, and I don't really care as much since.. even if it affects me by a little, I don't have a say in it." said Mijo as he drank some RoyalCo. 

"Just, whatever happens next.. was the will of the people of that so-called democratic republic of the United States of America. I don't really hate people who didn't vote, but like I said, be prepared for whatever consequence might come. Good luck, americans.. If you even hear me." said Mijo, as he looked at the paper again. "Hmm.. yeah, I don't need to say anything. But, can I assume that most of you listening are somewhat leftist in your political stance? Well, it can't be that left, you listen to a princess talk with a knight, but whatever. Let's move on, because anything else I want to talk about in that topic are going to be reserved for later episodes." said Mijo, before putting the paper down and drinking some water.

"Heh? Why..? Like, I get it but what I mean is.. is there any specific like.. event or.. whatever you're waiting for? I know you have more to say about the matter, because you visited me last night ranting about the surrounding.. topics about that election." asked Jomi, as Mijo smirked and looked at Jomi. "Yeah, I am. Waiting on the reactions and video essays mainly. I want to survey the others before finalizing it, or at least.. I'm not confident about a few things, so we're just gonna have to see what happens in that country soon." answered Mijo, as they raise their water bottles. "Wait why are we doing this?" asked Jomi, before they clinked their plastic bottles. "A toast to the new president of the USA.." said Mijo, before they put them down.

"Alright, next one.. my problems with the Filipino language.. and Math.. Hm. First off, I just wanna say, I don't have problems with the subjects, it's just.. my attitude and confidence at them is increasingly becoming.. negative. As in.." continued Mijo, before clearing his throat. "just.. tired. I don't know.. Like, every time I try to listen or understand some Filipino-translated story or angles of this circle and relation to it's parts.. I just.. like.. It's like when you've just woken up and you feel your brain being all hazy and foggy before you fully wake up by either checking your phone or going to do something.  It's.. odd? I don't know why.. I usually like literature.. I write literature, and my family is filled with accountants and math graduates.. So, why in this world do I have some sort of brain mechanism, fogging my mind every time I go to school?" ranted Mijo, as he stopped to drink RoyalCo lemon-flavored softdrink.

"Hmm.. You said to me in private once that you always struggled with math.. and filipino, ever since elementary. What I, and our listeners want to know is.. have you figured out some reason or at least cause of these shortcomings in your work?" asked Jomi, as Mijo pondered about it, holding his drink. 

"Hmm.. I would be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it, but at the same time, I would be lying if I said I figured it out. I mean, I'm supposed to be the trilingual gigachad or something, and yet reading my own old Filipino works makes me dizzy? Like, I don't get it. Even with the subject being taught by.. less than ideal teachers, no disrespect! It's just.. it doesn't work for me. Of course, I tried learning on my own.. But then those same problems show up. Same with math really." said Mijo, as he drank more RoyalCo.

"Hold on, pause that topic for a minute. Lemme just.." said Mijo, before grabbing Jomi's paper and scribbling down on it. "Ugh.. well, if you didn't want any political content.. You're out of luck." said Mijo, as he gave the paper back to Jomi. "CAT again? Mijo.. you might want to consider taking action to prevent it from hurting you, this is the third time!" said Jomi, as  Mijo nodded. "I know.. but even that one.. classmate of mine, I'm going to anonymize her, but she struggled very heavily between the transition from after exams in September to the last weeks of October. Let's just say, she's probably going with CAT, no matter what." said Mijo, as he took a deep breath and looked at the camera.

"Let's make this quick. I am not good at memorization, and I often fumble when pressured too much. You know this. So, when this quarter's assignment is to get the signatures of every CAT officer, and to do this you'll have to memorize everything on that little blue book they made us write. I can not remember anything on that little blue book, I don't want to, and yet.. this one will probably be forced upon us in the following weeks, and I hate that. I.. don't like this. But, every single damn fudging time I speak out, there's this sense of 'you have to do it' and it's 'part of being a Honrato student' being implicated in the way they order and off-handedly tell us. Ugh. That's it. That's it for today. I'll have more to say every day and again. Sorry for those people that through this episode and rant figured where I stand.. but, can't help it." said Mijo, as he leaned on his chair and looked at the ceiling.

"He's referring to.. Citizens' Army Training, by the way. For our new visitors, whom are coming from the first topic. Anyways, Mijo.. wanna finish this up and head outside to train?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, alright. I think I saw Urda there.." answered Mijo, as he cleared his throat and looked at the camera.

"Final and fourth topic. Rest and Sleep problems, well.. let me just say that if I sleep without restriction, I sleep at twenty o'clock then wake up at eight. For non twenty-four hour clock people, it's eight PM to eight AM. This is an exaggeration, of course. Since, I never sleep early. I also use alarms, so my unrestricted sleep is never fully extended a lot of the time. Anyway, rest. It's something I need often that causes a lot of problems. Such as.. well, if you're resting, you're not doing anything else, right? So, anything I should do, ought to do, or anything like that, I usually forget. By the end lf my so-called rest, I am still tired but now I know the political climate of a random country." said Mijo, before he stopped himself.

He stretched his arms before he started to speak again, "I just need to be proactive, I guess. Anyways, about that.. Jomi, let's end this off." said Mijo, as he brushed his hair.

"Okay!" said Jomi as she nodded then turned to the camera. "Well, that'll be the end of the daily podcast of the Dajovy Times, hosted by your favorite people, Mijo, the truly interesting individual with many opinions that are truly life-changing haha... and me! Jomi, your princess in the dark, tirelessly working on managing the kingdom, while doing everything she can to not work tirelessly!" said Jomi before the two started speaking together. "This has been The Dajovy Times, remember.. don't give up! Never surrender, and have a good rest this fine evening!" said Mijo and Jomi, before the camera turned off.

"No guests for this one, huh?" asked Jomi, as Mijo picked up some paper. "Yeah, Rhida was busy, Ikari already left the school, Urda's busy too, training.. I also had no topics I could make them discuss, oh well. Hey, have you turned off the.." said Mijo, before the voice cut off.

"Interesting pick.." said Mijo, as he looks pretty amused. "Hello! Welcome to our podcast, sort-of.. still working on that. Anyways, called The Dajovy Times! I am Jomi, co-host and the princess of the dark, Mijo.. whom is.. kinda horny right now is the main host, and the lightbringer! There'll be featured guests, and I'll introduce them as they come, but for now, let's start!" said Jomi, as she looked at Mijo.

"So.. instead of making me talk about my problems you gave me this? You sure know me, Jomi." said Mijo, as he looked at the first one. "Cycle of Darkest Pleasure, please tell me Jomi, kindly what this.. chapter was about." said Mijo, as Jomi blushed and nodded. "It's an.. ahem. an.. alternate world where Jomi... and Cara go in an adventure to.. defeat huge sex monsters." said Jomi, as she awkwardly laughed a bit.

"You and Cara? Weird pair considering what she has done to you. You know, rape, torture, massacre, genocide, basically evill stuff all around. Even you have experienced the end of it.." said Mijo, as Jomi continued to blush. "I'm not saying that didn't happen! I swear. It's just.. you know, different world exploration stuff. Like, you get me? It's not once or twice that I can comfortably explore this without.. without.." said Jomi before trailing off. "I get it. But, if you were uncomfortable with talking about it, why make it a topic?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head.

"N—no.. It's just.." said Jomi, before Cara teleported behind them. "Surprise!" exclaimed Cara as the two were scared out of their chair, but for different reasons. "W—what!" said Mijo as he summoned his sword while Jomi is looking at Cara, almost in anticipation. "Y—yeah.. You told me you were coming.. but make it a surprise." said Jomi, as Cara laughed and looked at Mijo. "Don't worry, dear lightner, I'm not here to take Jomi away, not yet anyway. I've been requested by Jomi to appear in this part as a 'bonding' experience, and I decided to join of course." said Cara, in a casual tone.

"Mhm. I'm keeping my weapon steady. Just in case." said Mijo as he kept his weapon at the bottom of the table. "So.. first part.." said Jomi as she read it. "Anyways, Jomi already showed me this. If you want to read it, you can check that website I created, it's in there." said Mijo as he winked. "What are you talking about? Did you publish it?!?!" questioned Jomi, as Cara looked at Mijo with a threatening glare. "Ah, no. It's simply a self meta-referential sentence. Don't worry about it, I refer to the world like that." said Mijo, with a smile.

"Okay... Well, in this.. world. Um, there's tentacles.. Cara has them.. she uses it.. um.. that's the premise.. She uses it on m—me.." said Jomi, as she whimpers when reading the paper. "Oh wow.. If you wrote this, you must've loved our.. private moments." said Cara as she teased Jomi, by gently touching her cheek. "Sh—Shush! Cara.. please.. you can bash me later.. Because it keeps going." said Jomi, trembling as she reads the next part. "So.. after.. um.. birthing a tentacle egg.. Cara and Jomi head to Mijo and Rhida and trap them in a room so Cara can use the tentacles on them."

Mijo and Cara are both shocked and widened their eyes. "W—what.. Tentacles on me..?" said Mijo, as he sat down, looking away in embarrassment. Cara blushed a bit before looking at Jomi, with a smirk. "Are you sure you don't enjoy me? I mean, it's not everyday you sexualize your rapist, huh Jomi?" said Cara, with a chuckle, hiding her regret. "Uh.. um.. hey..! it's supposed to be private stuff.. I wasn't thinking straight when I wrote it, okay?" said Jomi, as she shook her head.

"I—I.. okay.. Cara, what do you feel about this.. ahem. Like, the.. past..?" asked Jomi, trembling in her voice. Cara is silent as Mijo looks at her curious. "Hey, yeah! I've always wanted to know.. What's the mind of an abyssal being with many crimes put on her name?" added Mijo, as Cara looked at the two, with a blank expression. "Let's just say.. That was our most extreme time, a time filled with ambitions of power and strength. Filled with rash decisions, and obsession with control." said Cara, as she took Jomi's water and drank it. 

"How about now? Still on that grind to take back Jomi and merge with her? I get that you were joking earlier.. But, I want to confirm your statement." said Mijo as he held his sword, while staring Cara down. "Mmm.." said Cara as she looked to be preparing something with her dark aura increasing. "Guys.. uh.. this was a mistake.. let's end it now.." said Jomi before ending the podcast without an outro.
