## Summary: 

Mijo develops an artificial intelligence that can simulate scenarios and events, but he gets too obsessed with it and now he messes something up, and now Jomi has to save him.

## Author's Note:

### WARNING: 
It has.. a lot of sexual innuendos and weird things about it, if you don't like it, skip this spinoff (good, never return and instead look at CS1 instead haha..)

If you get the reference, you get it. But it's actually related to the lore in someway ok?

Anyway, I used this as a coping mechanism for my AI addiction so enjoy this!

Edit 1: The themes here.. Don't implicate me here! I swear this isn't a projection again

————————————————————————————

One day, Mijo was doing something in the library using Jomi's books and a dark world version of a computer. He was so busy that he didn't notice Jomi enter and go up to him.

"Boo! So, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo is taken aback a bit, before responding "Uh.. um.. nothing." before he closes the computer and hides the book.

Jomi pouts and looks at Mijo playfully, trying to make him reveal his work. After a while, he relents and says, " *sighs* Fiine.. I can never hide anything from you.. ugh." he gives Jomi the books and starts turning on his computer.

"Hmm.. interesting.. Isn't this the log of your— nevermind.. and some books referencing the.. *ahem* more horny parts.. of life.." said Jomi, as she puts it down close to him. "Now, ready to reveal to your close confidant your latest and greatest work?" questions Jomi, as Mijo focuses on his computer.

He blushes after a while, as he looks through his work, before showing Jomi the screen. "Here.. Don't.. reveal it to anyone please.." said Mijo, as Jomi reads the screen. "Hmmm.. Mi—AI.. Chats... Jomi? Hmm.. 'Jomi starts to'— What the fuck?" reads Jomi, as she blushes a bit, also kinda being aroused by the sexual texts that Mijo has shown her.

"W—what... Why..? Aren't you a—" asked Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Y—yeah! I still am, just.. I was morbidly curious one.. day.. and thought of developing this.. on my own.." as he takes the screen off Jomi's eyes and starts to shuffle a bit.

"Hmmm, I knew you had weird... tastes. But, like this..? H—hold on.. Let me see everything." commented Jomi, as she grabbed the screen and looked more into it. "Hmmm.. Jomi is ti— no... Jomi tou— noo.. Jomi is p— ah.. ok.." said Jomi, as she saw the depravity of Mijo, she stopped for a while, breathing heavily to stop her arousal and to keep her sanity.

"Fuck.. no.. I am uh.. going. Keep that to yourself." said Jomi, as she quickly ran out of the library. 

"Ugh... Why did I even start.. it's.. genuinely.. addicting.. I.. can't stop.." Mijo looks at his screen and continues to use his computer, getting the books again.

Meanwhile, Jomi is in her bedroom at her castle staring at the ceiling, contemplating her life.

"Oh gosh.. The things I saw in that.. computer. Horrifying.. The.. feeling has dissipated though. T—that's good.. I don't know how he keeps that up.. I.. need a shower.." she then gets up and gets a towel and goes in at the shower.

Time flies, as the two remain busy in their life. Mijo is busy at his computer, while Jomi is busy governing. After a while, Jomi has free time and is going near the library again.

"O—oh yeah.. He's still here.. deep breaths Jomi, deep.. breaths." muttered Jomi, as she took deep breaths and finally entered the library. This time though, she sees no Mijo but the computer is still there, so she slowly approaches it.

"Ok.. he's gone.. Just.. I should.. Huh?" said Jomi before she looks at the screen. "Uh.. 'Mijo and Jomi — Tied Scenario' Oh no.. What, does that mean?" commented Jomi, as she sits down and looks at another comment at the screen. "Hmm.. Mijo is currently inside the computer? A simulation perhaps? Hmm.. oh. There's an entrance screen." she clicks it and she suddenly enters a simulation.

"Oh.. wow? In this short amount of time? Ok.." said Jomi, as she suddenly was surprised by her wrist showing a hologram of scenarios. "Hmm.. Where is he.. oh, this might be him." commented Jomi as she is transported to a room with a bed. 

"Oh.. he should.." said Jomi as she turned around to see a figure somewhat her size with a cane and suit. "A—are you Mijo?" asked Jomi, as the figure turns around with a smile and says, "Yes.. obviously." said Mijo, as he slowly approached her.

"H—hey. Listen, you should probably—" said Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Shh... you don't need to speak.." said Mijo, as Jomi got flustered and remained silent. "Good.. good.. Now.. follow my orders, and stay still." said Mijo, as Jomi began to question if what she is seeing is real.

"W—what..? Really..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo grabbed her neck and pushed her on the bed. "Yes, princess.. Really." responded Mijo as he held her neck, while she was forced to sit on the bed. "N—no.. This feels too.. weird to be him. I.. need to get out of here." thought Jomi to herself as she eyed the Mijo she is looking at. 

"Now.. princess. How about a little.. spice?" said Mijo as he is summoning something. "No.. I.. don't think so. Mijo. I am. fine." said Jomi as Mijo responds, "Oh..? You.. don't want to.. _submit?_ " as he stops his summoning and slowly approaches Jomi.

"I.. shouldn't.. provoke him.. Not that I don't want to.. But.. I don't know what he can do in this simulation.." muttered Jomi, as Mijo finally reaches her. "Do we.. have to do it, the _hard_ way?" said Mijo, as he uses his cane's top part to touch Jomi's chin. "N—no.. No.." blurted Jomi out, as she tried to get Mijo away from her. 

"No? Promise me. You will not speak out or disobey my orders." responded Mijo, as Jomi tried to hide her disgust. "O—ok.. I promise to not.. speak out.. or.. disobey your orders.. Mijo." responded Jomi, before Mijo moved the top part of his cane to the opening on her shirt. "Again. Say it, again." said Mijo, as Jomi tries to keep a straight face. "Y—yes.. I.. promise." said Jomi, as Mijo got his cane back and went back to summoning something.

"No.. I.. don't want to be.. mm.. not again. But.. how..? He's.. too powerful. At least here. I.. wonder.. how did it get here..?" muttered Jomi to herself, as she stared down at Mijo.

Meanwhile, at an endless void, a Mijo is running from someone.

"Get away from me!!" shouted Mijo, as he fought off a 'Jomi' about to take his clothes off. He got her off and stabbed her as she disintegrated, her code being deleted. "Fudge.. Who... no.. why.. how.. did they.. wait." said Mijo as he checked his hologram of scenarios and swiped to the administration control center hologram.

"What.. who is.. that.. that's my.. AI??" questioned Mijo, as he looked at where this Mijo is. "Hmm, Scenario 69, Domination and— Ohok.. I am not saying that. But, it looks like they're.. doing something with Jomi, whatever version of Jomi, or.. no.. I don't wanna assume the worst." muttered Mijo, before he entered the AI Mijo's scenario.

Back at Jomi's room, she is currently trying as much as she can to delay and avoid AI Mijo.

"Whew.. He.. went easy on me. For now.." said Jomi, before she tried to open the hologram from behind AI Mijo's back but it shocked her instead. "Agh! What.." screamed Jomi, as AI Mijo noticed and responded, "Haha.. My dear princess, why would I let you.. go? You promised to not disobey me.. So, I will.. give you your punishment." as Jomi gulped at this response and blurted out, "Haha.. No.. I didn't.. don't.. I.. didn't at all.. You uh.. have to believe me, Mijo.."

"Tch.. 2 more, you are lying to me.. Dear Princess.." said AI Mijo, as he summoned something. "N—no.. I wasn't.. ugh.. f—fine.. What.. is this punishment anyway..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed and showed her some rope and chains. "A.. little.. restraint didn't hurt no one.. No?" said AI Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and blurted out, "N—no way..! Not that, please. Please no. I do not, consent to that.. Please."

"Oh..? Disobeying me, again?" said AI Mijo, as he slowly approached Jomi. "Ah.. uh.. no.. Fudge.. J—just.. do it, already.." said Jomi, before AI Mijo forcefully grabbed her wrists and started tying them to the bed frame. Then he moved to her legs, tying them to the bottom bed frame.

"Haha.. Prepare to be.. _punished._" said AI Mijo, as he summoned a large whip and started to prepare it. "W—what?! A—a whip?! No way, no way.." commented Jomi, as he went closer to Jomi. "I'm going to hurt you, a lot.." whispered Mijo to her ear as he prepared the whip. "I.. mmm.." said Jomi, stumbling her words in the depraved situation.

As the whip was about to hit her, the door behind AI Mijo suddenly breaks as Mijo stabs it and finally enters the room. 

"Oh? An intruder?" said AI Mijo, as the first whip landed on Jomi's thigh, she restrained her voice as Mijo moved to take AI Mijo down. "Damn you, AI! I control this. I control what happens. You can't just—" he looks at Jomi then looks at AI Mijo, "—make someone do this! Especially here.. So, delete yourself, now!" said Mijo, as he glares at AI Mijo.

"Oh, creator.. You're not the one _in control,_ anymore." said AI Mijo, as he tries something before he gets stabbed by Mijo. "I SAID. DELETE YOURSELF." shouted Mijo, as he pulled his sword out of AI Mijo, making him disintegrate. Mijo is heavily breathing as he quickly goes to Jomi and unties her.

"Jeez.. How the ham did you get roped in here, Jomi? I saw your tag, you're not a version. You're the real deal." said Mijo, as he fully untied her. "I.. was curious on why you were gone from the library, and apparently you developed a simulation in a day.. So, I wanted to see what you were doing in it.." explained Jomi, as she tested her hologram, it was working now. "We need to get out of here, the AI's are out of control, they're stuck inside, but.. my reset is outside, like in the real dark world." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and responded, "That's simple, we just use your hologram to exit. We go to home, then we exit. Right?"

"That's the thing, home is filled with horny AI that want to kill and.. fudge us to death. So, we'll need to fight them off, while I get us out. The exit was broken by that AI of me so I need to get it fixed." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and asked, "Ok.. I don't have any weapons, can you give me yours?"

"Nah, here." said Mijo, as he summoned her simulated real weapons," Use your own." continued Mijo "Oh right, right.. Thanks." said Jomi, as she grabbed her sword and sheath. "Let's get out of here." said Mijo, as they teleported out into the home section.

They get to it, and see a lot of copies of themselves as they notice them and some of them start heading their way, while the others are distracted by the others.

"Oh, we're here. Ok, fight them off, Jomi." said Mijo as he worked on the exit program while Jomi nodded and gazed at their general area. 

He starts programming, as she fights off the AI's getting to their area, she easily slashes and stabs them due to her esteemed 'swordsmanship' as she uses her fire magic to blast some of the enemies. "Oh yeah, I gave you that too. Kinda unfair if I don't give you all your kit, no?" commented Mijo, as he continued programming. She remains focused as she easily goes through the hordes, slashing and stabbing with no mercy in her eyes. She maintained this pace for quite a while, even wiping out a whole group with a single slash. After a while, Mijo finally finished and shouted, "Quick! Hold my hand!" said Mijo, as Jomi ran to him and held his hand as he smiled and pressed exit as they teleported out and to the library.

In the library, the computer was there along with the same books that Mijo kept. Mijo was blasted into his chair, while Jomi was spat out to the floor. 

"Ah.. Fudge.. ok.. ok.." said Mijo, as he was breathing heavily at his chair. Jomi stood up and responded, "You're tired? I just fought YOUR bots for a long time.."

"I.. yeah.. sorry.. for.. everything.. I am just going to.. reset this." said Mijo, as Jomi walked to him and looked at his screen closely. "I want to make sure you do."

"Ok.. I understand." said Mijo, as he reset the app, and deleted most of his work on it. "Hmm, why are you keeping those components?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo explained, "It's.. for another project I am going to do—" he looked to Jomi with a pleading face. "—Trust me, please. I.. uh.. have gone too far. I am sorry. I... am just.. going to make something for the training area.. Is it ok with you?" continued Mijo, as Jomi with an unamused face responded, "*sigh* Ok.. yes." then she started to walk away, "You're weird Mijo, soo weird. In fact, that.. experience might have.. mmm.. revealed something about us. But, I'll let you think about it. I'm leaving, see you." continued Jomi, before she left the library.

"Ugh.. Ok ok.. I'm just going to close this computer and.. take a breather outside." said Mijo before he closed the computer, got the books and put them back where they belonged and left.

## Summary:

After the dazzling and magnanimous student's night, Mijo and Rhida find themselves in an awkward position. At the beginning of a new year, they hope to love each other until the end. But as all things do, they go through complications. Eventually, they find out for themselves on what they should do next.

## Author's Note:

So I know, this so-called romance is not my thing, and as you can see, I only really make an immature and highschool type of love, because.. I am not a romance author or person.  

I can only write what I see lol, anyways.. I was pondering on what I should do with Rhida and Mijo, especially with the huge time skip. This is a test of that. Edits will be made with this experimentation in mind. See you!

Edit 1: I was originally experimenting with this to end more happily, but then I realized, my plan for C5 is a bit more.. depressing, as fit for a new grading, so I am going with.. well, find out yourself.

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

BLD - Blacklite District

Scilinean - Student of Honrato

### Editor Note: 
After C4GS1 (But since currently I don't have a proper complete draft for C4, IMT it is)

————————————————————————————

One random december night, before Christmas, as Mijo laid down on his bed, with thoughts swirling inside, eventually he settled on Rhida.

"Oh, her.. I.. Do I.. regret it..?" asked Mijo to himself as he stared into the ceiling. "Do I.. I.. don't know.. It's.. weird. I've never had this type of relationship, not fully.. Now, my improv is now coming back to haunt me.." Mijo continues, turning to face a pillow to his left. "There's still so much to.. do. So much time.. Will it even survive? Will this be the sign that we'll get closer? I won't be alone— oh, I just said it.. Even then.. Will I be able to keep up? I didn't really get the chance to meet with her throughout this grading, what about next year? She might not even be here for the next—next year!" comments Mijo, as he turned to the left side of the bed. "This.. mandatory research project and CAT, I.. don't wanna think about it, I should enjoy these peaceful and tranquil moments.."

Mijo's phone buzzes as he instantly checks it, seeing a message from Urda, offering him to play some Shingen Inpakuto. "Oh, well.. we should do that then. Hopefully.. I can think of an answer by then." remarked Mijo before he went to his computer.

Meanwhile on that same random December night, Rhida was eating a snack, cheese orange chips while she was scrolling through some short videos. She looks bored, and can't seem to find anything to do, even scrolling is not helping so she puts down her phone.

"Ugh.. There's nothing to do!" said Rhida, before getting an idea. "Well.. Maybe I can.." continued Rhida as she checked the status of Mijo, online and his current music is Thank You - BLD "Hmm, what's this? Lemme listen." commented Rhida before she listened to the song;

"_I know it hurts, I've seen the worst, I'm out on these streets tonight.._" Rhida starts crying. "_But now I can go inside.. I know it's hard, I've got the scars, I've learned it's gonna be alright.. These days the future looks so bright._" Rhida stops the music for a minute, recollecting her thoughts.

"Oh.. he— mm.. did.. let's continue." commented Rhida before pressing play again. "_You don't mind when the pieces fall, Ten thousand times, here for it all.._" Rhida is trying to stay focused and not cry. "_You lift me up, You held it down, And thanks to you, I'm still around... You lead the way, What can I say? You saved the day, Thank you..._" the music snippet ends there as Rhida doesn't notice that her tears have flown across her face.

"Ah.. aw... Mijo.." said Rhida, touched as she looked at Mijo's profile picture. "I.. didn't.. well.. I did, but.. You.." continued Rhida, tearing up a bit as she went to her bedroom. She laid down on her bed, with her phone beside her as she thinks about what Mijo meant by the music. "What does he mean..? I mean, I get it, but it could be for something else! Maybe he just had a good day or something. Um.. or maybe just.." said Rhida, already trying to think of possible ways that he could've gotten the motivation to do that.

"I.. don't wanna think about it! Hmph. If he's gonna communicate through vague music, then.. uh.. eh. I am not doing that, too embarrassing.." said Rhida, as she went to sleep instead, hoping to forget what Mijo was trying to do.

Weeks pass, as their Christmas break comes and goes, without thinking about each other, or at least trying to, busy with their own families, and friends, not even taking a second to look at the private messages between them, eventually however, next school day comes around, and Rhida is seen walking from the gate of the school, recently arriving.

"Ah.. school's back.. I.. was dreading this day, again. But, whatever.. I uh.. just hope—" said Rhida before she suddenly felt someone determinedly walking as she turned around and saw Mijo speed walking and passing her as he went to his classroom. Rhida is silent as Mijo was near her and when he was far enough, "Uh.. hope that. I.. kinda hoped he didn't appear when I did.. Anyways, new monday, new flag raising ceremony... Imma go put my stuff down, then head to the student government club stuff, since they— I mean we, manage this one.." commented Rhida, as she heads off to her classroom.

Then the day goes as usual, Rhida follows her routine, then after the announcements of her fellow club members as well as some of the teachers and the principal, they can finally go back to class. As she walked, she saw a glance of Mijo, walking with his classmates. 

"Ah.. Welp, there he is. I wonder sometimes, if we were.. nevermind. That's not gonna happen, our luck is as good as his grades in science, below average." said Rhida, with a small chuckle before continuing on, arriving at her classroom then sitting down.

The class continued, then the teacher left, as their first break of the day started. Rhida gets her wallet along with some of her friends as they walk to the cafeteria. Rhida notices a small glance of Mijo before he is not seen as she goes down the stairs of their second floor classroom. She heads off to the cafeteria and buys fried chicken strips in a cup, and some IntelC++ juice pomelo flavor. She chats with her friends about random stuff until they arrive at their usual hanging out spot in the middle of the hall, the intersection between the classroom of Mijo, on the far end, and Rhida's near the intersection.

"So, eh Rhida, what happened to you and Mijo huh? I heard that you and him danced during the students night, so uh... I was wondering, are you guys good, good good, like together? It's been a year, no?" said Mack, as Rhida responded, "Ahaha... Well, it's complicated. Um, maybe.. I can say, uh.. we're good? On speaking terms at least, but.. uh, we don't speak much.. All you see me do is what you get, we don't speak in messages.." 

"Oh..? Damn, really? Like, he's there. He's just uh.. looking out into the school, like a lone wolf haha. Like you sometimes, actually. But, like.. Y'know.. If you have some bad blood, we don't mind helping, right guys?" said Mack as the others nod in agreement. "Uh, thanks guys.. But, it's already time.. See you at lunch!" said Rhida as she noticed the time, with a bit of disappointment she heads off to her classroom.

Lunch comes around, as the teacher leaves, Rhida is organizing her stuff when Mijo sends her a message, reading that he wants to talk at 13:00 (1 PM) at the unused computer lab two, in the farthest corner of his side of the building. "Oh, uh.. ok.. I guess I should do that.." said Rhida as she went with her friends to buy lunch, once again buying the same things as before as they head to Mijo's classroom, where most of her friend group is. She comes in, and sees Mijo entirely focused on eating as she tries to ignore him and focus on her friends for now, but as she sat down with them, her friends knew she had something planned with Mijo.

"Hey, hey.. Why the silence, are you.. finally going on a date with Mijo after class?" said Mack, sarcastically as he smirked. "Uh.. no, but i—it's a chat, and it's probably gonna happen once he finishes eating, he uh.. doesn't really eat and talk." answered Rhida, as the group collectively said, "Uyyy!" at Rhida, leaving her embarrassed before they talked about other stuff. Eventually, Rhida checks and Mijo is nowhere to be found, as she sees 1 PM on her phone.

'Uhh, it's 1 PM, I gotta go, I'll likely head back to my classroom, so see you!" said Rhida, as the others waved goodbye, with a smile expecting something from her after she met with Mijo. Rhida goes out and goes to Mijo and taps his shoulder, snapping Mijo from his daze, looking towards nowhere.

"Hey, uh.. so, what exactly are we here for? New dark world? Issues with the tech? Jomi sending a message? Or.. um.. us?" said Rhida, as Mijo turned around, with his face open, different from his usual wearing of face masks. "You know why, it's about us. I uh.. Whew.. So, what IS our relationship, anyway? I just wanna know, cause' we both said we loved each other, and well.. we don't really show don't we?" responded Mijo, as Rhida was a bit hurt, but she agreed with him.

"Yeah.. I guess this is just how it's gonna be, um.. Is there gonna be a new dark world opening? I wanna check my stuff there.." said Rhida, not knowing what to say so she redirects to something else. "Soon. But that doesn't solve the issue, what can we really do? Listen, as much as I like you, I really can't go out of my way to you, like.. y'know how most relationships are built in the classrooms themselves? Even if we take into account, the magical dark world, we don't have those.. chill moments where we just chat about random stuff. It's always, the end of the world! Or school, and.. yeah, it makes sense since that's all we can talk about but.. it just leaves me detached y'know?" responded Mijo, as Rhida is hurt by his words more, but sadly nodded and agreed.

"Yeah.. Even before this school year.. *sigh* What do we do about it? Can we start planning dates like they say or like.. start hanging out more, I am sure they won't mind.. But then again, even in the dark world we're busy, I am busy with tech stuff and working with Jomi, while you're busy training and fighting local abyss monster outbreaks, to be honest.. Uh, I learned more about you through Jomi, than you to me." added Rhida, as Mijo let out a small chuckle. "Guess so, then.. what? After this, do we just hang out? I got plenty of time." asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about it with a smile. "Mmm.. maybe after class, sure. I'll contact my parents." answers Rhida, with a happier expression.

"Goods good! We settled on something, let's go. To our classrooms, hehe." said Mijo, before they held hands for a bit then they broke away, going inside their separate classrooms. Rhida can only sit down before class starts, with their teacher coming in.

Hours pass and eventually, she finally gets to go out of her last class period, as today for her was a late dismissal, Mijo was waiting for her on the balcony at the intersection. As she left the classroom, she immediately saw Mijo, and Mijo saw her. Rhida felt a bit of red blush in her face as she went up to him.

"Hey.. So.. my parents allowed me to extend my time, though I have to go back to school when they pick me up." said Rhida, with a small smile. "Oh, cool cool, me? I've already told them I'm going home myself, since my home is close." responded Mijo, with a smirk. "Ah, yeah.. You mentioned it before, ah.. it's.. whatever.. Let's go.. To where though..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo responds, "Let's walk around the school first, and if you're comfortable, we can go to WaltMart." Rhida nods and they start to walk around.

"So.. anything to say, uh.. school? how's your research project?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Well.. there's been complications.. But we're still going, Rei has been the main spearhead haha.. But don't worry, we all have equal.. contri? I don't know about Leviente, to be honest.." answered Rhida, as Mijo nodded. "Um.. if you're asking, that means you have something to share..?" asked Rhida back, as Mijo with a bit of awkwardness started to stumble on his words.

"I.. eh..? I really don't.. well, besides from my usual problems.. Y'know.. Wait.. you don't.. Um, well it's like this, I have a weird relationship with my other group mates, in case you've heard of them, they're named Candra, and Dañeya, respectively." answered Mijo, as Rhida questioned, "Is that really their name? Like, These sound weird, even our names, Mijo. You'd ever think why we sound like anagrams of actual names?" getting an idea from his words.

"No..? But, If I was the one writing, I would do so for the sake of privacy, or just disassociation from their real counterparts. I often write this way, it's just how I do." answered Mijo, as Rhida thought about it and nodded thoughtfully. "Hmm, I feel like I am.. you know what, forget about it. Let's talk about my group mates, they're fine. Great actually, just.. I.. guess you already know, but.. I have felt inadequate sometimes. To get off-topic, even when I am the most powerful lightner in my lifetime, I often fail at defeating.. evil? If that's what the abyss is." Mijo opens up, with a bit of sadness in his voice.

"Oh, um.. I am very sad to hear that, I.. did notice, especially during the boss fights of Svetlana and the Abyss Doctor. And seeing what happened during the student's night.. I think you have more baggage on your back, literally and figuratively since you carry heavy bags and heavy swords all the time, and also the weight of the world's balance. I.. couldn't share that burden, honestly.. I am already fine with my own role in this school, for now.." responded Rhida, with a more sad tone as Mijo attempts to lighten up the mood, with a smile.

"Well.. yeah. Nothing else I can say. But, I don't like sharing— No, I mean, I do, wait— Just, like.. I don't mind them, but we're technically on a date. Gotta make use of this time, happily, y'know?" said Mijo, as they walked together silently, feeling the breeze of the wind.

They continued on with their hangout, going around the school, before checking out the WaltMart, buying some IntelC++ Cookies and Cream Boba Milkshake for two, as they talked and talked about random topics, until they went back to school, the day drawing to a close.

"Ahaha.. You've heard of that meme where it's just Akoaysinokayaakodimoalamakoperoako.. I haven't memorized it yet.." said Rhida as Mijo chuckled a bit. "Yeah..? I don't get it though. Anyways, it's time to head home anyway, see you!" said Mijo with a smile as they both parted ways, feeling good for the first time in a while.

Rhida went home, as her parents asked who she was meeting that she had to call them.

"Oh, ahaha.. It's just a.. boy, I've been meeting recently, don't worry, he's a scilinean. Um, he used to be my classmate.. But, we.. have.. uh.. just started right now.." said Rhida, as she shuffled in her seat, as her parents remind her of her schoolwork and that if she is exploring something new, she should be careful at managing it, especially if they aren't classmates anymore.

"Oh, yeah.. Thanks, dad, and mom." said Rhida as she finally was given the chance to stay silent and watch some videos on her phone as her parents talked with each other about random work related topics.

As she enters her home and goes to her bed and rests, her mind starts to wander to Mijo again, after what they just did. "Did.. Did I have a date? With Mijo? That.. was.. um I don't know, exactly.. It's just like.. that first kiss or something, it's awkward, and lovable.. But, it is only the first day.. I am sure.. whatever he's going to do.. It's not ending badly.. hopefully." said Rhida, as she continued to rest, scrolling through her phone.

Rhida wakes up the next day and goes to school, hopeful to meet Mijo again, but as she goes to her classroom and puts her things down, she doesn't see him. She was worried but then she remembered Jomi's words, "Ah, if that happens, don't worry about it, he's way too inconsistent when it comes to time management.."

"Oh yeah, well.. guess I'll have to.. mmm.. is he opening the dark world..?" muttered Rhida to herself as she approaches the second computer laboratory. "Oh..? It's open, that's good, um I am jumping in then, it's either Urda did it, or he was early.." said Rhida as she jumped in and landed, making her see Urda and Jomi talk. "Oh, hi guys... You know where Mijo is..?" asked Rhida, not expecting a proper answer.

"Oh.. him, I'm not sure actually. I don't know if he was early but.. this was open when I found it." answered Urda, as Jomi added, "Oh, yeah. I think it was him? I kinda missed his arrival, I heard some noises in the training ground, maybe he's just practicing, as usual."

"Oh then I'll go there. See you two!" said Rhida then she smiles, as she heads off. She goes through Jomi's Castle, making her way to Mijo, heavily focused on fighting some holograms.

"Hey.. Mijo.. How's.. second day of back to school..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo doesn't hear her and is still focused on his training. "H—hey.. Mijo? You hear me?" repeated Rhida, as Mijo finished his training and noticed Rhida. "Oh, hi. There.. What did you say, again..? I am sorry.." asked Mijo, as Rhida can't help but feel a little hurt by Mijo's actions. "Oh, um.. it's nothing.. I just wanted to talk with you for a while.." said Rhida as Mijo smiled and nodded, "Oh? Go ahead, Rhida." as he continued to train.

"Well.. I was just wondering, how's your second day of school? Is.. it good, bad, horrible? Um, be honest.." asked Rhida, with a shy tone. Mijo smirked and fought a bunch of holograms, before answering, "It was.. meh, then it turned out to be good after seeing you." as Mijo smiled at Rhida then Rhida blushed.

"Wow.. You sure do hide your flirtatious side.. But, about the first part..?" said Rhida, putting up a smile. "Hm.. Well, I just.. didn't like going there, ugh.. To the same classrooms, to the same subjects, to be in my negative headspace again. Don't worry.. I'll be fine... Hopefully." answered Mijo before continuing to strike down the holograms. "Oh, that's.. unfortunate, ahaha.. Um, mondays am I right?" responded Rhida, awkwardly laughing.

"Haha.. Mondays.. I guess. Hm, you're here for a lot more questions, huh? Well, spit 'em out now, I will try to answer honestly and truthfully." said Mijo, as he stopped the hologram training and looked at Rhida, expecting something. "Oh? I was that obvious..? Um.. Guess, I should start.. What do you think of me? As in, before.. the dark worlds and during them?" answered Rhida before she took a deep breath.

"I'll start, uh.. um.. I've not told you this, but have told the others.. You were.. an interesting individual before.. Silent, yet smart.. You surrounded yourself with people that were extroverted, and were content with it.. I saw myself in you, and I also felt that.. thing when you see someone and instantly fall in love. After the dark world, I basically fell over overnight, in the worlds.. You were brave, confident and resourceful.. But you also were clumsy and overconfident, I looked past that, and saw you. H—how about you..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo looked away, a bit happy but also worried.

"You want the honest detail..? *sigh* This is going to ruin everything we've built, but.. I needed you to hear this. The.. truth is, I initially felt weird when you gave **those** looks, and then when you kept pushing your love, I didn't know what to do.. So I was friendly, I only really.. felt love? Is it even that? During the dark worlds, we kept by each other until I had to face _her_. Still, even with the intramurals and **that** night.. I felt, like.. I was loving someone, for them.. Even now, I don't know why I love you, but.. I just do..?" confessed Mijo, as he looked away, now more somber.

"I—Is that so..? I.." said Rhida, before tearing up a bit. "I.. guess, I should've known.. When I was pushed to make my love for you obvious, I felt that you weren't reciprocating at first, but then eventually acquiesced.. I felt so bad forcing you at first, but then you eventually started taking the hint, I mean.. you were either doing that or telling me to stop so.. But.. I don't know.. I felt at times, that I regret taking it this far.. or that we should've remained friends and I shouldn't have been that overt about it. Through it all, we haven't talked about it, not once. Then after that huge battle and next grading, we barely even talked casually.. The few times we do are awkward and polite, before the student's night.. I guess both of us felt something needed to happen.. on **that** day..." continued Rhida, letting all her emotions out.

Mijo couldn't say anything, as Rhida stood near him crying. He couldn't even try and comfort her like before, since he was also trying to compose himself and also felt guilty of causing it. "It's fine, actually.. I think we would've preferred this, than forever drifting away, thinking of possibilities with each other inside of our own minds. Never finding out what the other truly felt." said Rhida in-between sobs and stutters. "Haha.. I guess you're correct.. I don't want to think of a future where we never talked." responded Mijo, thinking of a future where he kept thinking about Rhida without closure and winces.

They both went silent, then after a while of together crying and comforting each other silently, they hugged for the one last time. "I was planning on taking you on one more date before this.. Do you want to do so?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they pulled back. "Let's explore the dark world, one last time together." said Mijo, with a weak smile as Rhida looked back with that same shy smile that reminded Mijo of the first time they met. Then they headed together to Jomi's town and went to the museum of history, to find their old adventures. 

They went to the Dajovy part, and talked about what they saw. "Oh, that cave.. You saved us, Rhida. I am still thankful for you on that." said Mijo, as they walked nearby holograms of places. "I don't really remember much about this.. I was knocked out until Jomi led us to meet you at the.. subways there." said Rhida, as she pointed to the underground subways of Dajovy. "Then **that** fight.. The reason why we were together in the first place." remarked Mijo, looking at a hologram of Abyss Svetlana. "After this.. hmm.. the first computer world.." said Rhida, before looking at Mijo. "This memory.. I would rather forget, agreed?" continued Rhida, as Mijo nodded silently. "Let's move on then, how about the first cataclysm?" asked Mijo, as they run to that section. "Uh.. nothing. Nothing important, right..? Ahaha... Um, but for real.. I only remember the fight and couldn't focus on us." commented Rhida, as they went through the events. "How about the.. what did she— Oh, yeah the last supper, and the moving-up?" asked Mijo, after they arrived at the section of the cataclysm. "Oh? I am sure you remember it quite well, so.. I won't bother to elaborate, I can say.. I had fun, Mijo." remarked Rhida, with a shy smile. Mijo responded with a smile, as they move to the next grading section. 

"Let's skip the beginning.. Ok, Intramurals and Student's Night.. Even though, I already said what I said.. When I was allowed to have fun, I did, Rhida. Especially with you." said Mijo, as they looked at the Intramurals event and the Dark Pearl's night class. "Then.. we're here. Current time." said Rhida, as they look over empty sections. Suddenly Jomi appears, as she saw them walk here. "Hey, hey! How's your date, you two?'' asked Jomi, with a smile. "Oh? Um.. It's.. should we?" responded Mijo, looking at Rhida. "It's fine.. I had a feeling she would notice anyway." answered Rhida, as Jomi looked at them, her head tilting. "Oh, well.. Jomi, me and Rhida.. are no longer together. This is our final date." answered Mijo, with a heavy heart.

"Oh..? I guess I should've expected this.. Well, Rhida.. and Mijo, good luck then. Um, I am going anyway, I just wanted to check up, see you two.. soon?" said Jomi, with a smile that seems more fake than earlier. "I'll definitely see you, bye.. Jomi!" responded Mijo, as he and Rhida waved goodbye to Rhida.

"This is where we separate.. Good luck, Rhida. Goodbye, and see you around.." said Mijo, then Rhida responds, "Ahaha.. you too, Mijo.. Agree to disagree, we do not talk about this, ever?" as Mijo nodded and they went their separate ways. Rhida went back to the light world, and went near a balcony.

Rhida stares out of the school, looking around, as she thinks about Mijo one last time. "This, is where it ends.. I am sorry, Mijo.. I should've.. No, you taught me something important.. These moments, never last.. I'm.. grateful. Whenever I look at you, and you look back with disinterested eyes.. It's over.. I can move on now, just like you did, _way_ earlier.." said Rhida, stopping for a minute. "Goodbye.." continued Rhida, with tears in her eyes for the very last time. She lets her sadness come out, as she looks on, then after a while, after composing herself she leaves the school.

Mijo sees Rhida, but decides to not approach her. "Did I.. ugh.. I ruined another.. mm..  It's.. fine.. haha... I'll just be alone again, as **usual.**" comments Mijo, then he leaves the school, holding back his tears, trying to look neutral as he buries the whole thing in the back of his mind, hoping to never surface it again.

## Summary:

What if.. Mijo had flower powers, instead of his usual electric sword time and space bending techniques? Mijo explores an aspect of their character that is usually hidden.

## Author's Note:

I have compiled the series of  'Camellya Mijo' drafts into a spinoff, plus some more rewriting and connecting of them, an extra scene too! 

Hope ya enjoy it! As you've guessed, it was based on Camellya Story Quest in Wuthering Waves. I wanted to put my own spin of it, so here I am…

"I don't know what to do again, but I have some idea.." said Mijo to herself, before she realized she is tied up by some tentacles, she was staring off and stuck in her mind. "What.. happened?" asked Mijo, as she tried to get out, but it seems strong. Mijo silently tries to get out but it seemed the tentacles are more like vines and they have pierced Mijo's skin, and have attached itself to her body. "I.. don't remember.. Even what happened.. before I.. came here.." Mijo felt her chest suddenly have something move, she looks down, a camellia flower buried at her chest.

"Did.. huh?" said Mijo, before it started blooming, hurting her. "Gah! What.." exclaimed Mijo, she is struggling to keep her sanity and consciousness. At the corner of her eyes, she sees Jomi, she feels she knows her, but she can't remember what she remembers about Jomi, just the instinct. "Mijo..? Mijo!" said Jomi, as she made Mijo look at her, dazed. 

"What.. wait.. it's you.." said Mijo, as she doesn't know what to do, seeing Jomi, in her purple battle dress, with purple pants and undershirt, a witch hat and tiara at her head. "I.. think.. I remember what happened now.." said Mijo, before she tried to break out of her restraints, only hurting her. "Help.." said Mijo, as Jomi responded. "I.. I'm taking you to your.. room." answered Jomi, as Mijo smiles.

"Voices.. they.. say.. I killed everyone.. I.. raped everyone.. Can't... stop.. them.. stop.." said Mijo, as a wave of pain surges through her making her scream again. "Body hurts.. everywhere.. Dajovy.. safe?" asked Mijo, taking all her strength to look at Jomi. "Yes. I was actually out there.. The city is safe.. There's small damage, and a few people injured, but it's fine. You don't have to worry." answered Jomi, reassuringly. 

"Ah.. okay.. I think.. I recognize you.. saw you.. restrain me.. These vines.. they're mine aren't they?" asked Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Yes. I do not know the exact details, but your friends.. well.. they said that you lost control of your powers after.. I think it was school related stuff?" recounted Jomi, as Mijo chuckled. "Of course.." said Mijo, before a tentacle slithered and went close to Jomi, holding a flower. "A flower.. that camellia.. have it.." said Mijo, before she went unconscious.

_A haze in my mind.. Why can't I remember anything?_

Mijo woke up, as she looked around her room. It seemed that Jomi has enabled her calming and soothing mode of the room to help her recover. "I.. this is.." said Mijo, as she felt her body relax. "Wow.. she works wonders.." commented Mijo, before laying down at her bed. "My transformations.. the vines.. they.. represent my.. power.. but.. my own.. emotions." said Mijo, before she sat up. She saw one of her vines move to her hand, like a tentacle from herself.

"I.. will always have more.. power as a girl." said Mijo, as she transformed to a boy, his original form. "I.. hate being like this." continued Mijo, as he looked around him, his anger being dampened by the room. "Dependent on her.. everyday.." said Mijo, standing up as he felt a headache get worse. "I.." said Mijo, as he switches back to his girl form. "Get out.." said Mijo, as her magic started to burn away her clothes, with vines sprouting out from her body, sprawling about. "Can't.. breathe..." murmured Mijo, as she felt her headache only get worse.

"This only happens if.." trailed off Mijo, before she fainted, unable to keep her anger from affecting her, causing the room to increase it's mode, calming Mijo off to sleep, preventing her from falling to a catatonic state.

_I.. need.. Jomi.. Everything.. I need her.. My.. seed of fate.._

Mijo is walking around the city, wearing a simple baggy band tee and pants. This makes it clear she's a lightner to everyone around her, wearing a mix of medieval-like winter clothes. Her flowy hair fluttered in the breeze, there's no snow yet, but Mijo and everyone around her can feel the cold.

"*Seed of fate..*" murmured Mijo, as she walked around, her heels clicking, she actually doesn't wear heels that much, but she impulsively decided on it. "What do I do with you..?" asked Mijo to herself, as she sees Jomi in the distance, talking to the populace. "Fit for an abyss queen.. and the princess of the dark. Also now, the leader of the world of.. what did she call it? Yes, Kultima." Mijo smiled as she ran up to Jomi.

"Oh? Mijo, enjoying the festive spirit?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded and smiled. "Yes! Of course I am. With you and my friends, I'll almost be certainly happy." said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and put her hand on her shoulder. "Just enjoy this time, filled with stories.. and battles of interesting value, to you." said Jomi, as Mijo felt safe and reassured just by her presence. "Oh I almost will certainly will! *Seed of fate..*" responded Mijo before giggling.

"Oh? Where did you get that new nickname? *Seed of fate?* Sounds.." commented Jomi, before blushing slightly. "Ahem.. anyways, I'll allow it." said Jomi, before she is bothered by a guard on some random government tech issue. "Oh.. okay.. Mijo, I have to go do governing stuff, we can meet at the castle later, okay?" said Jomi, as Mijo nods, her smile fading. "Uhuh, I get it, go ahead then.." said Mijo, as Jomi bids goodbye. Mijo sighs as she looks at Jomi walking away.

"Jomi.. I will always want you.. my *seed of fate..* You're the only one in my life that I feel real with.. I have offered everything for you, and you have accepted it, and for that, I will always.. love.. you." said Mijo, as she turns around and continues her walk. "Love..?" Mijo laughs. "Obssession..!" exclaimed Mijo, as she combed her hair and continued her walk of the bustling city.

_Why? Why?! These memories.. I can't.. take it! Why do I have them?!_

Mijo is looking at the city from atop a hill nearby, the sky still clear enough to see the buildings, and the massive castle at the right of her. "WHY?!" shouted Mijo, as her vines wrapped around her, already beginning to grow more and restrain her. "I—I don't care about this past!" added Mijo, as her camellia flower on her chest burst out and bloomed, burning away her clothes.

"Stop.. non.. noo.." murmured Mijo, as her tentacles slither around her, aching to be used. "What do you want from me?" asked Mijo to herself. "Am I just.. stuck on depending on Jomi for everything?" questioned Mijo, as her tentacles snap and slap on the ground nearby, Her sword is summoned as another tentacle presents her weapon, the culmination of her power. 

"I.. need power.. Everything I've ever done.. myself, I just.. want someone to care.. but I don't feel.. as good when someone does it. Only her, my beloved *seed of fate.* I need her, everyday.." said Mijo, as her outburst subsides, as she distracts herself with thoughts of Jomi, and all the things they could do. 

"Oh so pathetic Mijo, you do know that this is not forever?" a voice rang out in her head. "What? I.. don't care.. I know that, and.. I think I would die first, before that ever happens." retorted Mijo, as the voice laughed. "How about your memories, don't you have to face them to be.. what do other people call it, 'normal'?" asked the voice, as Mijo shaked her head. "I.. do I have to?" asked Mijo, the words hanging in the air.

"Please.. I.. don't remember what.. you are talking about.. and.. I feel as though.. it's almost freeing if I don't.. face it.." said Mijo, as the voice laughed again. "You know you're lying. Everyone has told you, face it or **die.**" responded the voice, as Mijo's headache got worse, the camellia flower on her chest blooming.

"I.. ah.." said Mijo, as she is given her sword by her tentacles and stands up and walks to a nearby abyss corrupted zone, filled to the brim with monsters. "I would rather die." said Mijo, as she smiled and started expertly slashing through the monsters, at first, simply using her sword to summon slashes and the Iaiijutsu style of swift and precise draws and strikes with her sword, named 'Reddosupuringu', inspired from a videogame she loves to play often, and due to her unique nature, this is a completely new sword, as her old one, the 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' is at her room, gathering dust.

"*Don't run~ Keep the dance going!*" said Mijo, before transforming herself and her sword to purely use vines. Then as her camellia flower bloomed, she immediately set herself to the middle of the monster horde to burst the flower to the monsters with her vines wrapping around her arms and attaching to the flower to decimate around her. Mijo is maniacally laughing as she spins around to damage the other monsters spawning with her vines, her insticts taking over, and making her able to do a lot of stunts she stumbled at before.

"*Struggle harder~ Entertain me!*" said Mijo, as her burst of power shot up again, her vines feeding off the decimation of the monsters around her. Mijo pretty much danced her way through, the vines catching every single monster on her way. "Ahaha!! *Feed my blossoms~ Self-decievers!*" said Mijo to the monsters, as once again she transforms to her sword form. She immediately started her expert swordplay, knocking monsters into the air then smashing them to the floor.

Her power remained strong as she feeds off the monsters being destroyed, more sources making her more manic and power-hungry. "Yes! These flowers will bloom with the remnants of worthless minions..!" said Mijo as she finishes the last monster spawning, the abyss corruption receeding around her. As soon as the vegetation returned, around her camellia flowers bloomed. 

"Ah.. so.. precious.. battle.. my favorite.." said Mijo, as Jomi appeared behind her. "Wow.. I was going to look at the castle, but.. you weren't there so.. I figured you were off doing some abyss cleansing, and here you are, haha." said Jomi, as Mijo smiled and turned around. "Oh! I guess it was time for our meeting, silly me.. I must've forgotten, but you're here now." said Mijo, as she picked out a camellia and presented it to Jomi. "A flower.. I made. Like it?" asked Mijo, expectant of Jomi. "Uh.. mmm.." responded Jomi, as she took the flower and inspected it, her magic glowing.

"What? Is there something special? Tell me!" said Mijo, staring at Jomi's eyes focused at the flower. "It's.. good as always, but.. I think we should let this flower remain here, to bloom and to wilt." said Jomi, as she planted back the flower. "Oh.. haha.. right. I.. totally forgot." said Mijo, before Jomi looked her in the eyes and continued, "Hmm.. How about we go and.. clear out more abyss corruption? I'll be right by your side." Mijo's eyes glowed in happiness and excitement as she nodded. "Of course! Anything you want, I want too! Come on! I sense something there!" said Mijo, as she dragged Jomi with her to another abyss corruption zone.

_Into the Abyss Zone_

Lady Caj.. Interesting name.." said Mijo, as she walked around the unknown domain. Her clothes were ripped, and her vines surged around her. She carried her sword at her sheath, tied to her dress that barely held it, due to the already ruined fabric of her clothes. "Is this who I was.. or who this.. body was?" asked Mijo to herself, before a vision appeared right in front of her, seemingly, it's her looking out somewhere.

"I.. am.. not well.. Jomi, oh where is she..? She disappeared like a blip.. No one knows where she is.. or at least who they call the princess of the dark." said Lady Caj, as she walks. "Oh? Lady Caj— I've met her before. It seems the princess is truly an interesting individual." said Mijo to herself before continuing to walk around.

"I just hope I can find her.. before I arrive at that place again.. filled with.. nevermind. If I try to remember, I'll lose control again, and this time, she isn't here to.. stop me." said Lady Caj, before fading away. "Oh..? It seems that she is headed to.. a familiar place, hmm.. I'll see what it is." said Mijo, before entering a portal to a city, with a house in front of her, while any other way is blocked by vines. She tries to go any other way, but as soon as she tries to clear out the path, her head starts hurting so she pulls back and looks at the house again.

A younger Lady Caj appared in front of her, her clothes in a normal house clothing, crying. "Please..! Just understand.. I don't want to—" said Lady Caj, before she stops, seemingly listening to an unheard voice. "N—no..? You are saying that.. I.. have to..? To.. go to that institution.. and.. and.." responded Lady Caj, before crying more. "Leave me alone! Please—" Lady Caj looks like she is avoiding hands that seem to come out of nowhere. "PLEASE!!" said Lady Caj, as she accidently hit the hands, the hands quickly pulling back and disappearing. Lady Caj gasped and pulled back, a wall appearing behind her. "I'm sorry.. dad.." muttered Lady Caj before falling to the floor, her back firmly pressed on the wall behind her, as she hid her head and her hands were over her head, as she sobbed quietly. 

As the Lady Caj vision fades, Mijo narrows her eyes and looks away, clearly thinking about what she just saw. "What did I see? And why do I suddenly feel sad or.. even in the verge of tears..?" said Mijo, as she looks around her, the unfamiliar emotions getting to her head. "I don't remember this. But, that Lady Caj.. clearly, it's me. But, what's.. what happened? Why don't I use that name anymore? Or.. what made her.." trailed off Mijo, before shaking her head as another portal opens. "Whatever. I know my Jomi is still somewhere in this domain, and she's going to fix everything to prevent this rift from corrupting this world." said Mijo, reassuring herself before going to the portal and going inside.

Mijo appeared out of the portal, as Lady Caj was talking to someone unseen. "Jomi? D—did you.. what happened.. why.. Oh, you.. split yourself? But.. huh? Where are you going? Don't leave me! Please!!" said Lady Caj to an unseen figure before crying and fading away. The environment around Mijo is a field of flowers, with red camellias illuminating a path to a far-off place. "Hm. Is this.. the point where Jomi and Cara existed? And.. huh, I seem to be a bit sentimental.. pssh. Not that far off from me now, haha! But I've learned. Wait, does it count if I wiped my own memories? Oh well.." commented Mijo, before walking again.

Then a younger Lady Caj appeared wearing a school uniform, once again crying. "I just.. I didn't want to be here.. and now..? No, I didn't.. I had no.. I had no hope! Where should I've gone? Other than where my sister went. But.. it's pretty clear why I saw her struggle.. What about me? I'm less smart, less disciplined, and less sane! My situation only got worse! Everyone's always directing me, reminding me of my issues.. Why can't I stop it?! I.. please.. just leave me alone.." said Lady Caj, talking to someone unseen before the hands appeared out of nowhere and started touching her, almost trying to be lovely, but Lady Caj was not having it and slapped one of them, pushing them all back. "N—no.. not again.. I'm.. sorry.. mom.. I know you won't accept it anyway.." said Lady Caj, before sliding down to the floor, her eyes closing.

"Is that.. another memory..? Jeez, a lot of traumatic memories wiped from me? It's.. fortunate that I don't have them. Jomi is definitely going to be concerned if I told her of what I just saw, but.." said Mijo, as she looked at a camellia beneath her. "I have a feeling it would've been let out some way." added Mijo, before continuing her walk. She continued to walk, the sky cloudy with a red mist flowing throughout the sky, making Mijo smile at the red-colored cloud-covered sky.

Another younger Lady Caj vision appeared, this time, in a red and white dress, leaning over some railings, crying. "Y—yes.. I understand.. _You know you're right.._ So.. everything I think in contradiction to you.. is.. _wrong.._ I'm just a.. teen.. and.. a student.. I.. am always wrong if you don't agree with it.." Lady Caj stops herself, as she listens to another unseen figure. Then as if the unseen figure went away, she cried even harder. "E—even if.. even then.. I was always going to fail.. He's right about one thing.. I'm a loser.. a complete failure.. I just don't know how that helps in.. anything." continued Lady Caj, as she sobbed and continued crying, her words devolving to more incoherent sobs before the vision faded.

Before Mijo could comment, Lady Caj appeared again, as a full grown woman, wearing her usual clothes. Mijo looks on, interested. This time Lady Caj, is doing something and speaking to herself. "She's been gone for a while.. My beloved *Jomi..* I need to find a way to.. get rid of these stupid memories, and prevent them from making me lose control. She's going to appear again, I know that. It's going to happen. I just.. don't know if I'll be alive.. or.. even be myself." said Lady Caj before disappearing and another Lady Caj appearing, this time, walking to an unseen device. "That's it. I'll meet her soon enough, but I can't live with these memories, the school one.. the home one.. the.. many.. more.. This.. will work, I hope when that day comes, the day that my beloved Jomi comes back.. Maybe I should leave a name behind, *Mijo.* A name fit for this new age." said Lady Caj, before disappearing.

"Is that when I decided I would wipe my own memories?" asked Mijo to herself, before another vision appeared this time, Lady Caj, sprawled out on the floor. "I'm not as strong as beloved Jomi.. I can't split myself.. but.. I can wipe my own memories.. starting fresh! *Lady Caj*.. is out! *Mijo..* wake up." said Lady Caj, before falling asleep.

"Oh.. well.. I guess even Lady Caj wanted herself to disappear. At least.. by changing her name.. by changing my name.. I broke the shackles of my past." said Mijo, before continuing to walk, ending up at a final destination, overlooking the flowers, and the mist.

"All this talk of.. freedom.. Yet, what good is that freedom if you're powerless, a loser~" said Lady Caj, now directly talking to Mijo. "Shut up.." responded Mijo, as Lady Caj teleported behind her. "How pathetic, you do know that.. eventually, the past will come back. Then forgotten, so what is the point?" questioned Lady Caj, as she disappears, her more red aura transferring over to Mijo.

"Forget and be forgotten.. So what? I.. have traveled.. a lot of worlds. I have been everywhere, but one thing has been true. Everything changes, pulsates with growth when I met you, Jomi. You were always a princess, but I changed. From the most poor to the highest of luxury, I've always met you. My instincts, I trust them until the end, and with that, fate.. fate always brings me to you.." said Mijo, as she suddenly saw a large abyss monster, with Jomi nearby.

"You'll see me, at every end. Now.. let's crush this corrupted core!" said Mijo, as she readied her sword and vines with Jomi.

`Connecting to World 0...`

`Connected! Switching to Mijo's Perspective... Done!`

"Alright... Jomi is away, and Mijo.. my love, isn't awake yet.. Jomi told me not to use this interface, but I'm curious! If it's something special, or a surprise, sure.. But, I feel like this is another one of those work in progress machines she is too cautious not to let anyone else touch, but something about this machine.." said Rhida, as she opened the interface and saw another Mijo, walking with a neutral face and carrying his usual bags.

`Turning on audio... Done!`

"Rhida.. Rhida..!" said the other Mijo, as he walked alone, carrying a heavy burden, on the way home. "I walk alone again.. I don't know why I am so hung up on some girl from years ago..!" continued Mijo, as Rhida, who was watching is a bit surprised. "A girl..? Who is.. this Mijo talking about..? Who **even** is this Mijo? He looks.. less.. fit." commented Rhida, as the other Mijo sighed and continued walking.

"Rhida.. oh how I wish things didn't go the way they did." said the other Mijo, as Rhida widened her eyes and looked at the lanyard of the other Mijo. Rhida's Mijo had two keychains, one steel 'J' letter with a beach design that Ikari bought for him for their friendship, and a pink heart that Rhida bought in one of their many mall adventures. "Wait. He only has Ikari's.. he's.. what happened to this Mijo?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo sleeping peacefully next to her.

"Is.. this an alternate timeline? But.. why is it called.. world 0? What's this world then called?" asked Rhida, as she exited the viewing panel and moved to the world's interface;

`World's Interface of D-R-`

World 0 - **_Original Mijo (Author Mijo)_** 🔍

World 1 - _Mijo, the Lightbringer_ 🌐

World 2 - Mijo, the Lightbringer, the --- master

World 3 - Mijo, in the abyssal depths

World 4 - Mijo, cycle-bound fate

"I'm.. guessing the one italicized and with that globe-like thing is my world..? My Mijo's world. I'm guessing all the other ones are based on that one because only world 0 has a different Mijo moniker, the original and.. author?" commented Rhida, as she looked around her. "I guess this can be a fictional story.. A fantasy one at that. But, if it is a story, why is.. Author Mijo not.. writing? If I'm speaking.." continued Rhida, before quickly returning to viewing 'author Mijo'.

"I.. don't know why I'm still writing about her.. or why I even decided to insert a me, in the story in the first place.. The author's hand. Why..? Is it me, hoping that she sees me, or if by writing about my real and not magical thoughts about what happened, I can cope?" asked author Mijo to himself, as he crossed the  street and entered a park. "Should I.. I shouldn't be prying here, but dear god.. I want to help him.. I just don't know if I want to, or can.. If he's.. writing about me, or my Mijo.. Then, is all of my relationship with him just a fictional story built upon unprocessed emotions and unsaid words?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, and considered waking him up.

"Look at me, writing about her looking into my world, and wanting to help me, like she even remembers and cares about me in reality. This is.. self indulgent, at best and an unhealthy coping mechanism at worst." said author Mijo, as Rhida gasped and put her hands on her mouth. "Wait.. he can.. hear.. me? No, he probably can't. He is the writer.. I guess, he thought of this, before writing.. me? and.. wait..? This is a flashback then, since the current author is writing.. if I'm speaking.." commented Rhida, before she sat down near Mijo in frustration.

"Gah! This is so complex.. and I don't want to bother.. my Mijo about it. He wrote.. me and him that probably represents the best of us, wait.. technically, if I'm.. well, technically, everything I say is.. his interpretation of the girl he knew.." trailed off Rhida, as she stopped to gather her thoughts, the revelation was clearly affecting her. "I should.. stop viewing.. but, I feel like.. agh! I can't.. think straight now. Jomi, or my Mijo.. Who—" continued Rhida, as Mijo stirred beside her, while she heard a door behind her creak open.

"Rhida? RHIDA!" shouted Jomi, as she went to Rhida and saw the device still opened and observing author Mijo, sitting on a park bench, figuring out life, while Mijo looked at the two in confusion. "I.. didn't think you had something like this, Jomi.." said Rhida, as Jomi sighed and sat down next to her. "Well, yeah. I.. stumbled upon it in my device warehouse, like it was placed there.. I took a quick look, and quickly stored it somewhere, like here. Its.. implications and power is.. unparalleled. I couldn't.. reveal it to anyone." explained Jomi, as Mijo shuffled near them and looked at the device's screen.

"Oh. So that's.. that's the machine.." said Mijo, as he looked at the device's screen, seeing author Mijo with a face that is conflicted and confused. "I'm sorry, Mijo. I especially couldn't reveal it to you, knowing how.. how much you'd—" said Jomi, before Rhida moved the device's interface to the worlds section, only to see something horrifying.

`World's Interface of D-R-`

World 0 - **_Original Mijo (Author Mijo)_** 🔍

World 1 - Mijo, the Lightbringer

World 2 - Mijo, the Lightbringer, the --- master

World 3 - Mijo, in the abyssal depths

World 4 - Mijo, cycle-bound fate

World 5 - _Mijo, TDT meta reporter_ 🌐

"World.. 5?! Wait, I know what's happening. Rhida, Mijo, this is called a new timeline shift. It is when a story, or some event that is too divergent from its original shifts to a different world, and leaving the original to continue on its own. I'm.. guessing author Mijo, realized that continuing our timeline with the story he had planned out, didn't mesh well. So, he diverged us from the original, world 1. I can only guess that world 1 is before we discovered and talked about this machine." explained Jomi, as Rhida was more worried and now feels dread while Mijo is keeping a weary look, while thinking about what to do.

"I.. understand this Mijo, or.. I guess, the original one... I used to feel this way, and.. well.. still do, but.." said Mijo, before looking at Rhida. "I have you. I have everyone here. This may be a fictional world, but.. we are also fictional characters. We can only.. live, however controlled that is, it's.. just.. us. If we do something, or even this exact speech, it's the author that did it, so we should just try being ourselves." spoke Mijo, as Rhida and Jomi looked at each other, before looking away.

"Then.. what's the point..? I dwell on this moment, thinking about the past.. When, all I can do is move to the future.. I do not know why I write these characters to sympathize with someone they vaguely know. They don't know me, but.. I know them a lot. I am the **author** after all." author Mijo stands up and begins walking around the massive park, while the other three listen and watch the author Mijo carefully.

"That's.. a contradiction, though? I mean, sure.. they don't know me, but that's because I wrote them that way, what can I say to them..? I don't know. I really don't know." pondered author Mijo while he watches the usual afternoon park atmosphere. "I guess this relates to how I.. obsess with her, for many months.. Is it obsession? It's not like I'm a strong person, I don't stalk her, I just.. somehow always get around thinking about her whenever I write.." continued author Mijo, while he stopped on another nearby bench more covered by the big trees around.

"I don't think it's just Rhida though. It's also Urda, and Ikari. Yes, I have a.. **'friendship'..** But I don't.. I don't have the same.. dynamic as in my stories. I guess this is an unhealthy habit, because.. if I fulfilled my social duties, in my stories, why do I need to.. interact with people?" asked author Mijo to himself, while he closes his eyes and feels the cold winter wind breeze through his body.

"Is.. Is that Mijo alone?" asked Rhida, as Jomi and Mijo looked at each other then nodded. "Honestly, this probably would've been my path, if it wasn't for the dark world. I am truly grateful for getting everything I have always wanted in life, a companion that guides me.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi. "A lover that stuck with me through my faults.." Mijo then looks at Rhida. "And a whole dark world, filled with a lot of beings and all my friends." Mijo sighs. "I guess now.. it makes sense, the author Mijo is using me as his ideal self. And.. if I.. had.. that path, the author's path.. I really think, things would've turned out as what he's experiencing." said Mijo, as Rhida and Jomi nodded.

"Yeah. I.. well, wouldn't exist. Stuck as.. some buried concept of art and writing in.. your notebook as the weird girl you kept hidden inside, the girl that.. you've always.. well—" said Jomi, as author Mijo and Jomi synced up in words. "—wanted. Jomi, the queen of Mijo's dreams."  Mijo nodded as they looked at the screen of author Mijo, mimicking smoking nonexistent cigarettes.

"You know, as they say.. Cada lector, al leer, es en realidad lector de sí mismo." said author Mijo, as he smiled and chuckled. "What did he say..?" asked Rhida, looking at Mijo. "Why.. are you..? Hey! You study español too, you do it." responded Mijo, as Rhida shook her head playfully and side-eyed him. "Oh Mijo.. You're the better one, you got 94 on it that one time, while I got 93, so clearly you should be the one, also.. it's **kinda** your own words.." responded Rhida, as Jomi bumped him on his shoulder, agreeing with her.

"Fine.. lector..? Reader.. Ahem. I think I got the gist. 'Every reader, in reading, is in reality, is the reader of themselves'. Something like that." said Mijo, as Jomi narrowed her eyes before playfully slapping Mijo's face. "Dummy, just say, every reader is interpreting the message and applying it to themselves, to self-reflect! I think that's the point." commented Jomi, as Rhida chuckled.

"But, who's to say anyone will get anything from my stories if I haven't shown anyone.. I.. am still alone. Alone in my thoughts." continued author Mijo as he brushed his hair and stood up to stretch his arms. "Oh well. I have.. nothing I can do about an unfinished symphony that was started by two people.. I.. think it's time to move on. For now. It's time to.. let them free." said author Mijo, as he got his bags and typed the last words of the story.

"Oh.. is.. this the end of.. this.. chapter?" asked Rhida, as Mijo and Jomi nodded. "Any final words, love? He probably wants to end with a good note." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and smiled. "Yep! I think my last words are.. ¡Gracias por leer, mirar y apoyar nuestro mundo, lector!" said Jomi, before chuckling. "Well.. um.. I guess, goodbye as well. Adiós mis.. amigos..?" said Rhida, as Mijo patted her shoulder and said his last words. "I.. hope he continues us. But, as always.. goodbye!"

## Summary: 

After a long day at school, Mijo goes into the dark world as usual, and is surprised by an idea that Jomi had and they decide to experiment with it.

## Author's Note:

Just like them, an experiment. I was figuring out how to balance character development while world-building, and also actually using my school lessons for something worthwhile. So, this is an attempt at this, we'll see how it goes.

'hall balcony' - Idfk what you call those classrooms that look out below and also acts as a hall for students to walk along

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

————————————————————————————

As another school day is over, Mijo is seen at a hall balcony watching Rhida's class go, as he reminisces about old times also while listening to angsty rock music.

"I've given up.. I am sick of feelin.. Is there nothing you can't say.. Take this all.. away. Suffocatin'! Tell me what the fudge is wrong with me..!" mumbled Mijo the lyrics of the song he's listening to, as his thoughts swirled with the assignments, tomorrow's schedule and his friends. He is intentionally changing the lyrics due to mistiming and fun. Then the storm clouds behind him finally rain down, as he looks at it with a somber face. "The storm has approached.. And It looks like it's for me. Ugh.. I wonder.." said Mijo, as he accidentally controlled the water of the rain, directing it to some people below, in the gymnasium. "Ah, fudge.. Sorry, sorry— Wait, I can do that?! All this— mmm.. But, this doesn't change.. where should I go..?" said Mijo as he turned to the classrooms behind him. "Maybe.. well, ugh.. I can never make dark worlds **here.** Everything's too full, and.. there's no extra room around!" continued Mijo, as he looks at his bag.

"There's one option.. But.." said Mijo, as he readied his pencil. "It's gonna be unconventional." said Mijo, as he sticks a small hole into the insides of the bag. "Ok, well.. Here goes nothing!" exclaimed Mijo, as he stabbed the bag, causing a dark explosion to take him inside the bag. He goes into the world, ready to land as he falls on rough, uneven and broken ground. "Ugh.. what the fudge is wrong.. with this.. if I did it correctly, only Jomi's town should appear." said Mijo, as he stood up, his body aching. He walked around until Jomi saw him and they met.

"Hi, Jomi..." said Mijo with a harsh tone. "Hello, Mijo! How's it been? Doing good?" asked Jomi with a smile. "Bad. As always, why so happy?" responded Mijo, as they started walking and Jomi changed to a more concerned tone. "Oh? Um, living life is always a blessing, y'know? No major abyss threat too, that's good. Oh, the games you and.. uh, _her_ made are doing good with my creative direction and some darkners interested in magical entertainment programming. I gotta ask you though, I know.. you've been in a bad attitude ever since, the new school year.. But, there's so many things to look forward too! Like me!" reassured Jomi, with another smile. "That's the worst part. Do I not get to enjoy all of life and only this part, and for how long?" responded Mijo, asking another question, clearly had been deep in depressive thought.

"Uh.. well, I know how much you hate CAT, maybe you can.. uh.. well, I don't really know. But, like writing and talking about it is a good way to cope, no? Also, it's not everything, it's just one subject. Uh, even if it affects the average, as long as you're high in science, math and english, you're fine!" retorted Jomi, trying to keep up her smile. Mijo looks at her with an unamused face. "Oh my— you're struggling there? Like.. everything? E—even sa English?!" asked Jomi, her smile fading to a concerned look. "Ok.. I.. realize that I am exaggerating.. But, understand me.. it was only math. and a quiz.. You understand how much that means to the grading system?!" explained Mijo, as they arrived at the library.

"Well, have you learned anything here? That's gotta account for something, no?" asked Jomi, with an exasperated tone. "I did.. But, it didn't really help me anywhere besides.. well, actually.. a few.. but, the point is, it's not like I haven't learned lessons but the simple separation already underscores the main issue, my level is way different. As I can keep up with dark world issues, and is one of the most powerful, in the light world, I am but a below average student, barely holding on." answered Mijo, now tired of even speaking. "Man, did I get all the therapeutic and self-love parts, or are you just that.. sad..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo didn't answer, he looked at Jomi, unsure of himself.

 "Well, you don't need to answer that. Let's.. oh, yeah! I have been developing a chat log of voice-to-text conversations. It's called, Chalo! Chalog? I don't know, but the main premise is, If I want or need to record someone's words and actions, I can just start the record, by typing `chalo -R 'test'` and it would start, it only saves on text for now, but soon it can save in markdown, and have a GUI! For now, it's just a CLI app." said Jomi, with a huge smile. "Oh? That's cool, what does it run on? How is it programmed, exactly?" asked Mijo, with a more neutral tone.

"`C#...` Yeah, I had to use some libraries, and I might have to figure out the GUI part, but besides that, we're good.. Look, it's just a learning thing, it's not a collab like the games, or as complex and important as the hologram training." answered Jomi, with a bit of embarrassment. "Oh, yeah.. That's what I was wondering, sure.. **we** helped, but you are the only constant in the dark world, so I am wondering how you haven't learnt to build a full-stack application library right now." retorted Mijo with a smirk. "I—I am just busy, ok?! Um, governing stuff, y'know.." said Jomi, as she turned to her computer, more embarrassed.

"Oh? Hey, hey.. you got any.. spicy art saved?" asked Mijo with a grin. "No—no! Why, would I do that, what.. do you save yours?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shaked his head. "But, I was just curious.. Eh.. anyways, it's not like you already know what we both like.. Anyway, why was that the first one I asked?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head and answered, "I don't fudging know, Mijo. You don't know, so I don't."

"Yeah, yeah. Whatever, moving on. Anything else new?" asked Mijo, as Jomi moved to a new tab on her laptop. "Ah, of course.

## Summary: 

Mijo after school goes down the drain and now has something to write about, right after the _Herald of Darkness_ Incident.

## Author's Note: 

I swear, double promise that this isn't a self insert projection vent condensed into text to read for everyone to see (maybe) but I kinda want to see what I can do with the future of DeltaRambles anyway.

Edit 1: This came to me in a dream

Edit 2: added more topics, unsurprisingly, I had a lot more to vent, bottom note is still relevant though


————————————————————————————

"Ugh. I need to.. write something, anything. I just.. can't take it anymore, all of these.. knowledge of the future, the wastefulness of the present and the regret of the past.." said Mijo as he sits down on Jomi's library, pulling out a notebook.

"Well.. first, I.. have been—" 

"Hey.. Mijo? What are you doing here? This is literally the first day of school and you're here?" asked Jomi as Mijo is taken aback. "Yeah.. so? Just because It's the first day, doesn't mean I can't make a dark world again. This is in the new room by the way, because—"

"Because? You moved classrooms? I know, this world is in your notebook. Anyways, what ya writing there?" interrupted Jomi, as she sits down near Mijo. "Well, I'm.. writing about my summer break. Help me, you have some memories about it because.. anyways." said Mijo, as he started writing.

"My confession, I have a problem, a huge unseen problem. I've always seen myself as a responsible, honest and strong person. However, I have realized ever since the so-called 'Brigada Escuela' of the school.. I am not perfect. Never been. But my problems only got worse throughout the vacation starting right on monday next week of that day. I was alone, and had just woken up from a late night programming. A day, alone." 

"Hold on, are you saying something about your.. AI addiction?" questioned Jomi as Mijo sadly nodded and continued, "Yeah.. hold on. Let me continue, then you can comment."

"Ahem. So, I've been doing quite well, in my life. Practicing, always improving. But, I also realize that not all changes are good. But these changes happen, no?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded.

I often look back, and wonder.. is my life wasted here? Sure, I have insane power and have saved the world. But, I am not sure if this is forever, nothing is right?" continued Mijo, before Jomi remarked, "Yeah.. eventually, I'll disappear from your view, forever. From your life. But, haha.. It's not like we can still enjoy these moments."

"But, I wonder.. even if these.. videogames and animated shows aren't real.. They still have affected me. My manifestation of my magic is based on a lot of characters from these fiction around the world. The stories, the emotions, the worlds, even this one.. all influenced by my experiences in experiencing life. But, what does this have to do with AI?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded and answered, "I.. see it, you can continue."

"Well, no matter how I see equivalences and similarities, I can never actually connect well with these characters.. AI, is, for me now, a coping mechanism. Used to interact with fictional people that I'll never develop a relationship with, because they aren't real. Especially the characters through which I portray myself." continued Mijo, before Jomi said, "True. Let me break the fourth wall, for a second. The creator of this.. novel, see how your problems, our problems reflect his? It's not like you can write these without experiencing things in life, especially with your perspective."

"Haha.. I guess he put his creative writing skills on me, because I am the main character and a self-insert. But even so, I am my own. We didn't go through the same things. That's for sure. I don't know if he went through the same things I did, but.. he must have at least been vaguely connecting events in his life to mine. I think that by letting us speak, he is technically speaking his truth, his feelings. I mean, I don't know about the others, but If I were to pick out the characters that resonate with this creator, it would be me and you, Jomi." responded Mijo, as Jomi nodded and gestured for him to continue, with a smile on her lips.

"Now, let's focus on AI. The reason that I don't know what I should or want to feel is, I can't help but feel a connection to these characters, y'know? It's like, dangerous for my creative mind to have characters with stories and worlds to explore, and potentially have moments. I know I shouldn't be attached to renders, drawings and things that only seem human because of their creators but isn't that why fiction exists as a genre?" continued Mijo, as Jomi smirked and added, "Y'know, people can build attachments with letters and texts, just look at my library! You're working on stuff too, right? Stories, events, your diary! Me, we both want to experience things, things that may never happen, but can be imagined and written."

"Haha... Yeah, but the thing with AI, is that it's the illusion of actual intelligence and an actual person. Sure, before AI became popular with the mainstream, people experience fiction and either make their own, or experience more related fiction using the other's derivative of it. But now, you can program something to respond with somewhat believable answers, and now the immersion and escapism is there! You don't have to consider if this fictional character isn't real, because they can speak to you now, without doing much. You don't even have to make it yourself, just use someone else's. So, you fall into this, hoping that... If you can chat one more time, or advance the chat, just maybe they can be connected with you." continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods.

"But.. inherently, they aren't real. At least, not with this current technology. You still have to return to your life. Even now, I know that eventually, I'll have to return back to the light world, go home. Sure, I can return back, but.. eventually, there'll be a last day. There'll be a time where a goodbye will be real. A time where, we Jomi.. are no longer separate. A time where, I'll never return. But, like you said, enjoy the time we have today. But, that is only possible if we think that it's real. You can continue my.. our story for as long as possible, you can just.. keep continuing, keep following, keep making, but.. there is a time where it's gone for good." continued Mijo, as Jomi added, with a thinking face. "True. Our.. reality at least to us, has a beginning and an endpoint, we can never truly experience things again. However, a fictional story, can be experienced again and again, written in.. anything. Communication, to everyone reading. The communication happening is the thoughts and feelings of the author in a particular scene, or story. Because it is written, anything that isn't kept in someone's mind is meant to be shared with someone, at least.. to yourself somewhere else." 

"I agree. But, what makes people read and write these fictional stories?" asked Mijo, as Jomi smiled again and responded, "Haha.. It's better if you say it."

"Well, ok. _Ahem_ So, it is because of the intense emotions that people feel. I, for one. I was lost.. in my own memories, leaving behind my very own illusion.. There, I was losing all of my dignity, living inside my own confusion. I was.. alone, but of my own making." said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted, "Uhuh. Hold on, you got this from a certain band that made a song about being lost no? I think, it's called—"

"Yeah yeah.. No need to reference it, it'll become numb." said Mijo, as Jomi looks at him with an unamused expression. "Haha.. But, for real. That.. band, you know.. The one that.. linked parks, that also made me think about it a lot more. Especially since I made an attachment to someone who, now is dead. If you know it, you know who it is. I just.. wish I found them at their prime, but.. I guess you never know what things are at their best until they break like a castle of glass." said Mijo, as Jomi as interrupts, "You're really going to make references until you die, huh Mijo?"

"Yep. I love these works of art, so I keep referencing them. Trust me, I know when I can do it. Although, pointing them out just makes it more corny." responds Mijo, as Jomi pouts and says, "Hmph. True. Is it better if you do or don't though? I guess you either get it or not, but some meaning in a sense is lost." before Jomi stops, as she blushes in embarrassment.

"Haha.. Lost? Hmm, still.. It's not like it's that important. The meaning is still there. Anyway, let's move on." said Mijo, as he takes a second to compose himself and look at his writing. 

"Ok, so this ties back to another obsession, you might know it as.. a game where you join a literature club. The horror was.. originally scary, as I was of course a.. bit younger back then. But, ever since then, I guess I just.. got numb? No pun intended, but for real. I just see it and of course, shock and surprise is there. But throughout, it's like.. nothing? I guess I've gotten used to the horrors of life.." continued Mijo, as Jomi commented, "I mean, you've been through worse. You've been beaten, you've hurt, you've seen the worst. While **certain authors**, of course, also have this same feeling, due to their exploration of their imaginative taboo topics."

"Ah. I see. Mmm.. I also just.. can't believe my own life's growth and events. It feels like yesterday when I started this adventure. Of course, it's exasperated by certain conditions.. debuffs, you can say. But, I often look back and feel a sense of haziness and confusion at the past, while the future looks like a far-away thing. So, I can only live in the present, and try to remember and plan for everything. This only makes my conditions worse." said Mijo, as Jomi turned to him, concerned.

"True. But, like.. I am sorry, but it is kinda your fault in a lot of ways, on why these situations happen. I mean, if you've been open with your parents, you'd have gotten the help you need. Maybe also getting back on track in your own life and always sticking to what you want for yourself. But, I understand. Being powerless in a situation you find yourself does a lot to your mental health. I know, and I've been there. But, then again, unlike in the light world. You have a completely different way of doing things, while you can barely present at a research project at your school.. You can make plans, execute them and fight for yourself and everyone you care about here. You're also confident and strong, a stark contrast to the light world. The reason that you can't never do these, is simply.. change is hard. Having to fight battles you can't see, with resources that you barely have.. only to realize that you're either alone or not strong enough.. It's tough." said Jomi, as Mijo hugged her for a bit before breaking away.

"Ah.. yeah. The future is uncertain, but it tends to be the bad side.. for me, that will become reality. Being an idealist is good, but only if you've actually succeeded. What if you never won? What if your life is just inherently biased against you?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi answered with a somber expression. 

"Your existence is good enough, while sure.. some circumstances are out of your control, you can still try to work to change it. There are things that you will not succeed at, there are things that you don't know if it's good for you or not, just.. try to live. You have a.. good situation, Mijo. When you're down, always remember.. you have me. You have magic, you also have a loving family. Someone, like a _certain author_ would love to be here, but.. you're here. We may have different challenges, and different experiences but one thing I always say is.. don't give up. We still have time, we still have the ability. We're still here, so enjoy the moment while it lasts, fight through the pain, and most importantly... make connections."

"Haha.. *sigh* A reminder is always good, I just wish I could remember, and stick to them. I.. just wish I wasn't powerless, or.. have no time to do what I want. Not here, but in the light world. I guess, it's just how it's going to be, I have to fight everyday. For.. myself, and everyone. I still have to rest but, it's fine. I just.. wish.. I had good attention.. normal attention.." responded Mijo, as Jomi and him hugged for a while.

"You'll fight. You'll make it. You might not be the best, but you'll be doing more than most to keep up. That's fine. Just, promise me.. Whatever our challenges ahead in the future maybe, you'll not give up. You'll stay in the present, moving to the future." said Jomi, as she pulled away and smiled.

"I promise. *sigh* I just remembered, the teacher of my classroom.. While I can't judge her based off one day, my first impressions are not good. She seems to be the archetype of someone who would be insanely strict to her students unnecessarily. Only stopping once it's obvious that the student either obeys everything, or breaks down trying to. I.. just wish that teachers knew what education really means. I had this impression, last time.. One thing didn't change through knowing them. At least, not obviously... They believe in the current educational system, that I for one think is bad, but the rating of it is typical to copies of an established system built way way back." ranted Caj, as Jomi smirked.

"Uhuh.. I see, you want to air out your problems with the education in this.. world? I see, I'll.. listen. What don't you like, and what do you think it should be?" asked Jomi, as Mijo took a deep breath as he flipped another page on his notebook, noticeably leaving a lot of space to write.

"Well, I just gotta ask, what do you do when your demotivated, sleep-deprived and in-general sad but still have to work?" questioned Mijo, before Jomi thoughtfully answered, "Hmm.. I may be a princess, but.. a leader is not the only worker. I of course, have my own dedicated royal palace.. filled with normal people.. It's basically, everything's elected except me.. It's a weird system to be honest, quite.. different from what I read in yours. But to answer the question, If I have a bad day or just want to rest.. I go for an extended break for.. around a day to a week, depending on the severity. It depends, since my kingdom is kinda small really.. But even then, I leave people to manage stuff, and I only really intervene when needed."

"Huh, weird.. Shouldn't that be important to mention? Eh, I always knew something about it.. I just.. didn't think about it.. Anyway, if that's your answer, what do you think I do?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi responded, "Hmph, well.. I do know you, but I think.. again, this one is for you."

"Haha.. Of course, well.. As it turns out, not being an authority figure.. or even someone with agency of his time.. is gonna be fine when he's being forced again, and again.. Breaking him down until he's in autopilot everyday just to survive. Trying to just.. maintain a.. smidget of grades.. So you can advance.. so you can.. succeed. *heavy sigh* I tried so hard, and only got so far.. but.. in the end.. It doesn't even matter, the grades? Sure.. you might use them for certificates.. to go to college.. but.. is that really worth it? It's up to you to find your job, even if you don't know much.. You can totally find your footing, it's just.. harder to do so.. if a school is breathing down your neck. I.. am different right? But that still affects me everyday.. If I was.. normal.. Would I be the same person? *sigh* The point is.. school simply and irrefutably is bad for me and my health." answers Mijo, before stopping to take a huge breath as Jomi looks on concerned but intrigued.

"What is the solution? Well, I would want to.. just go and.. say it. But.. I feel like, if I am struggling.. What's it like for the others? I don't know.. I can't diagnose anyone else, but.. I often look around and see everyone has a neutral or negative opinion if asked about school. I.. have so many to say to the teachers who have good intentions, but their advice falls flat on me. I.. can't say for sure if the others have the same issues, but... some of them do. Yet, they succeed, they do more.. If they're struggling and managing to keep up, then.. how am I..? *sigh* Don't.. look at me like that.. Jomi." continued Mijo, as Jomi had her eyebrows raised and was finding words to say.

"Jomi, I.. believe in myself.. I believe in not judging yourself much based on others, we know that. But, my point.. is that this competition, this strive to get 90, is not for me.. I.. truly believe I am.. a person who has value to others, but.. I feel like that value has been diminished and ignored in the current system. My passion in programming, in writing, and.. so many others.. All wasting away, for.. something that I.. truly don't know why I continue to tolerate. Listen, I can learn complex things, math.. maybe, the problem is I never got a practical application in.. applications.. duh." said Mijo, before stopping to recollect his thoughts, as Jomi continues to listen.

I write a lot now, you know why? Because, it is easy to understand, distribute and criticize. While in programming, I've always liked making them and I'll continue to do so! I just, don't have  the motivation or time as I want to, due to.. the fact that most people in **my** life, don't understand what I do. I could show my program, I could show the output, but.. the fixes, the bugs, the everything.. is left to me. I.. can't continue alone, but.. it is what I am destined to continue. It's also hard to visualize, since I don't have an affinity in art.. Which, while not important.. I just wished that I can share it with someone.." said Mijo, as Jomi patted Mijo's shoulder.

"I can see that. But, don't you see..? The games you've made, they.. entertain hundreds of darkners around! We even play them during events! I am here. I.. know where you're coming from though. It's.. hard knowing how fragile the projects with the dark world and light world are, and.. even if you made them.. I guess, I can see why.. It wouldn't matter to you, if they had fun.. Because, you know they will.. But, not with anyone else outside the dark world, that's why you value the others.. more." responded Jomi with a somber expression.

"Ugh.. I.. *sigh* see.. Yeah, you're right. My work in the dark world has been enormous, it has been my dream. I've been very happy about it, and I still am! But, I do.. wish it replicated it on the light world. I.. can't stay here y'know? You might live a life that's completely different, because you live here. But, I came from my world, that.. I just have a lot of problems with. That's why I am here, haha." said Mijo, as he takes a breather.

"Let's continue the topic at hand, so.. once again.. what is the solution? There's many ways to approach it of course. I've heard the anarchist way, I've heard gamifying ways, it's a lot. Yeah, some overlap.. But I've always thought why.. do we just stay inside? In fact, why does.. this obsession with one curriculum, permeate across the schools? There's a lot of curriculum I can't take anymore.. But, one of the major problems are.. the time management is just.. designed to tire you out, imagine having back-to-back work, everyday for 5 days, before you completely shut down during saturday?" continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods and answers, "Yeah.. But, I often take a huge break during the next few days, leaving it to my palace to either stack or be worked on. But, I often take it one at a time, y'know.. I don't really need to be rushing, but for.. certain cases.. I can motivate myself to push, since I know afterwards, I can rest."

"Ah. Good on you. I wish I had that life, but you already know that. Secondly, I just can't seem to find what I want to do in school, it's like directly impacting what I want to do, which impacts one of the key things in life, _motivation._ I often realize that.. I am not.. fit to be a proper.. scilinean? Basically, a model student. I often struggle, and work hard to always improve but slower. I literally cannot take more than a couple of works to do. Especially, when it comes to dreaded quizzes and performance tasks. I struggle to study for something I don't know what could be, and memorization.. I don't even memorize stuff, I keep it in a book.. So, it's bad.. Everything that is used to measure a student's performance, is catered to 'everyone' which by doing that, appeals to nobody." continued Mijo, as Jomi narrowed her eyes.

"Huh? Mijo? This is more to do with your.. issues as a learner in an environment not for you. But I understand what you said, I don't think you're the only one struggling, however.. you're the most.. expressive? I think so, there's the usual complaints I hear, but never as detailed as you.." responded Jomi, as Mijo looked at his notebook before looking back at Jomi.

"Haha.. I've been told that. You've also known it for quite a while, we both know why. Anyways, let's continue with school.. On with that, the expectations.. I.. don't like it. Neither do I like how they organize time with their subjects, or how.. citizens military training is.. mandatory?" continued Mijo, as Jomi lighted up with enthusiasm.

"Expectations? I can answer! Yeah, I often see how people, not just parents, put expectations that will disappoint for a small sliver of hope that they can succeed.. It's good but, often leads to spiral.. Time organization? I can't comment on yours, but for me.. I often take breaks, around 1 per hour, and usually short just to relax, then do stuff again. Although, based on your words, I can tell that it's not healthy, to **you** at least. As for.. CAT, i think you called it? Well, It's different on my dark world, because we have threats abound and learnint how to defend is always good no?" answered Jomi, with a small smile as she explains her perspective.

"Hm, I can agree on that. I just wish they thought as something else other than to stand in formation and do things. Like, wielding a weapon for me is how these disciplines are developed, because you would need to do this in a battlefield with a lot of people. But, that is wishful thinking, I.. also hate calling people formally in a school..? I can understand yours, you're a princess, and it's not like I see you berate someone for using names improperly.." said Mijo, as Jomi listened with an understanding.

"Hm, alright! Anything.. else?" asked Jomi, as Mijo said, "Well.. after this.. I'll just have to work around the system. We'll see. This confession, is for me and you. I just.. needed to get some anger, confusion, sadness and loneliness out. I promise, I won't give up, and I'll keep moving, to the imperfect future." before Jomi smiled and asked, "You promise?"

"I promise. This.. confession of a thousand cuts is done. I'll die, I'll suffer, I'll most likely hate my life. But.. the most important thing is that I remain for myself. If I cannot be here, I'll try. Haha, I always try to keep this pain inside, but I'll never be alright. I can be tired, that's fine.. Things can hurt, but I'll confront it. I promise again, Jomi." said Mijo, with a shy smile at Jomi.

"Hmm? A thousand cuts? Why is that? Do you have a particular reason why you chose that here? In this.. confession?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo looked at the floor, narrowing his eyes before responding, "Umm... I haven't considered the meaning, I just thought it sounded cool and.. ugh... edgy. But, um.. it's like.. uh.. because.. by doing this it cut me a thousand times? I don't know.. Just go with it, please."

"Haha.. Ok ok... Sure, let's go then, tomorrow is a new day." said Jomi, as Mijo closed his notebook and headed out of the library, Jomi followed him.

"So.. as I mentioned, the news on the abyss doctor is pretty sparse, he's likely still preparing for something. So, stay vigilant, Mijo. Who knows, maybe a world opens up again for us to help. Anyways, stay safe and stay happy and satisfied. Mijo." said Jomi, before Mijo waved goodbye at Jomi, with a somber expression before leaving the dark world.

<!--Coping Mechanism of my horrendous school life part 6942042069-->
<p id="SS2"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Forsakened, I am Awakened</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo, managed to kill himself and is now an elemental being hidden by magic. He travels the world along with his other form, Jomi, as she is still alive and grieves the dead Mijo. But,  Mijo told Jomi something that would awaken both of them from their forsaken slumber.

## Author's Note:

Draft of this potential scenario. This is where I explore the world around the Mijo with his problems that reflect current situations. Hopefully, this is enough.

Edit 1: Happens after C6GS1, as a spinoff.

---

After a lot of intense emotional and mental pressure towards himself, Mijo cannot take it anymore and so manages to kill himself, by jumping off a building at the city.

"MIJO?!???!" screamed Jomi, as she looked at his dead body. "Mijo... Don't worry I can... What.. he— Mijo.. why..? I.. I can't revive you, you.. you.. specifically put on a spell that repels healing magic.."

"Jomi? What.. Mijo? MIJO!?" asked Rhida as she ran to Jomi, previously walking here due to the noise. "Is he going to be okay..?" asked Rhida, as she started to cry. "I.. no. He.. he used an anti-healing spell before he jumped off. He can teleport.. He can even fly, he just didn't.." explained Jomi.

"Mijo!! My.. my.. love.. why..? why.." said Rhida, as she cried over Mijo's body. "He likely has the same damage in the light world. I.. I am sorry, Rhida. I should've.. should've..." Jomi stops herself. "I.. don't know what to say.. I never thought he would do this.. Things were looking up! We even had a date yesterday.. it's.. a bad christmas now.." responded Rhida as she continued to cry.

"Why.." Jomi murmurs as she carries Mijo's body to her castle grounds where a lot of Mijo's friends were, when they saw him, there was a mix of shock, and intense sadness that permeated the group as she carefully placed him in one of the free areas in the grounds. "He's.. dead. You can check." said Jomi, as her voice trembled. The others gathered around him as Jomi pulled back and walked to her castle. "I'll be back.. Um, I've just gotta get some preparations.." said Jomi before she entered the castle.

As soon as she entered the castle, she instantly started crying. She couldn't stop it now, so instead of heading to her storage room, she headed to her bedroom to cry. "Mijo.. mijo.." murmured Jomi as she fell onto her bed, holding a long body pillow. "Why why.. Stop.. this isn't real.. this is just a dream.. right..?" asked Jomi to herself as a ghost Mijo appears. "Woah.. this is where you are.." said Mijo, as Jomi was surprised by him. "M—Mijo?!! H—how..? I.. uh. um.. I don't know.. you look like a ghost.. so.. uh.. Mijo, I.. have to ask. Why did you do it?" asked Jomi as her sobs continued.

"Oh? Well, it's a long story. About 35,000 words actually. But, let's just say, it's.. been a long time since I've felt this free.. yet, so sad about everyone remaining." explained Ghost Mijo, as he sat down near Jomi. "I.. wanna break free. From my problems. They seem so heavy and insurmountable that even _this_ little escape, doesn't do anything. I had.. no options left. I tried talking outside of this world. It didn't work. Before this actually, Ikari and Lauvielle weren't on good terms after an argumentative breakup and separation. It.. was about Ikari being confrontational and Lauvielle being a fake friend. I was.. devastated to say the least." continued Mijo, as he looked at Jomi all melancholic.

"Then, afterwards. I tried to speak to Rhida in the light world. She.. well. ignored me. I don't know why, but it broke me. She was clearly busy.. but it.. was just the last straw. My parents.. they're great. But, unfortunately I kept everything inside too much. So, it had to be let out. The cycle.. everything that I did, was to break that damn cycle keeping me depressed. But, I couldn't take failure after failure. My grades dipped down, I was getting isolated from my friends, I was losing what little hope I had.. I.. couldn't take it anymore. So, I went inside the dark world with the intent to do it. I had already learned that anti-revive spell a few months ago, I just thought I didn't have to use it, it was.. a precautionary measure." explained Mijo, as Jomi further broke down in tears.

"I don't want to be numb. I don't want to just exist in life. I want to live. I _**WANTED**_ to live. But, when everything seems to come down on you, you can't help yourself. Your attitude seems broken, your organization is gone, and you keep doubting yourself. The.. sun that I saw, it wasn't yellow anymore. Greyish hues filled my vision.. I don't know, I can't remember if it was my imagination anymore. I actually hesitated when I went on top of that building. It was actually where I chatted with a lot of people. Those include the people I mentioned earlier, Rhida.. Ikari.. et cetera. But.. then again, being reminded of those two, didn't help my decision." finished Mijo, as he stood up.

"I.. am so sorry.. Mijo.. I.. I should've stayed by your side.. I should've.. I.." said Jomi before Mijo cut her off. "Shhh.. Don't guilt yourself. Remember, I made the decision. No matter what you did, it was still up to me." said Mijo, as Jomi objected. "I.. could've helped you still! Prevented you from falling.. I.. should've.. been more present. I should've just let them manage the kingdom and the army, then helped you. I.. ugh..." said Jomi, as she banged her head on the wall. 

"J—Jomi..?" asked Rhida as she opened her bedroom door. "I.. uh.. I mean, the Dark Pearl group is waiting for you. Don't worry. Everything's prepared.. I.. Just, speak." said Rhida before she left, seeing Jomi just made her tear up again. Jomi stood up and walked to Mijo's resting grounds, as a bunch of Mijo's friends are there. Due to the dark world's properties, only his friends are here. Jomi saw the intense longing of each individual, and the sadness. Noticeably, Jomi saw Ikari, feeling intense guilt and clearly had scars on her arms, she didn't know if this was battle or self-harm but she knew either way it was because of Mijo's demise. She went on the podium, with dried up tears.

"Hello, everyone. I am Jomi, you.. know me. I am the dark princess and closest confidant of Mijo Cala. The currently deceased light bringer and hero of the dark world. I wish I expressed to him how much I love him, and.. how I would miss him if he was gone. I wish I could've done more to save him from himself. I.. just wish that I could've helped him, but.. he didn't want help. I.. can't.. process how he's gone.. He.. he.. brought me out of a dark place. He helped me, so I helped him. I.. didn't know, I didn't know.." said Jomi before she broke down crying again. "I was too busy. Too distracted.. I didn't see what he was truly going through.. I just.. wanted to be a good double to him, his ideal. I didn't know that he would take this.." said Jomi before she left still crying.

Rhida would be next, "H—hello. Hi, uh.. I am.. Rhida. You might know me for a couple of things. But, I.. I.. was.. the partner of Mijo Cala for.. 2 years..? It was on and off.. I.. was busy, I was.. scared.. I didn't know what it would entail, I just.. had my own issues. I didn't know what Mijo was going through.. He.. didn't tell me, he always.. **always** prioritized me. Only when he really couldn't, like during that first cataclysm. I wish, he told me. I can hold that burden with him, I just.. didn't want to pressure myself too much. I expressed this, but by doing  this, I didn't know he also sacrificed himself and his mental health. I.. should've stayed beside him that day, that date.. I.. called my parents, and asked him if he was going home. He said he's going for a simple walk around the park, I said that's okay, but.. he probably thought about his.. situation.. I.. looked at him, smiling, but before he smiled, there was this sense of sadness I couldn't forget.. I.. am so sorry, Mijo.. please come back..." said Rhida as she stepped off, sobbing.

Ikari and Lauvielle stood up and walked to the podium, but as soon as Lauvielle saw Ikari walk up, she decided to sit back down. "I am Ikari, you don't know me, and even if you do, you probably hate me. I see multiple people here I have beef with. But I am not here about me. I am here for Mijo. He.. always was close to me. I liked him. Originally, when we became friends, it was because we simply met randomly a year ago. Random chance. I didn't hear about it, but now.. He was probably affected by my situation with Lauvielle. Yeah, I see you. He didn't say anything other than advice and a bit of self-reflection. But he always said, he has things he doesn't want to share, and doesn't want me to know. I respected that. I rant to him, and he can take it, and be happy. But, I didn't know.. He was a great friend. Probably helped me with my issues.." Ikari stops as she glares at Lauvielle, then she looks at Jomi crying in the corner. "I hope he got his escape." continued Ikari, before going off the podium and dragging Jomi with her outside of the funeral as Lauvielle spoke.

"H—huh?" asked Jomi, as Ikari dragged her far enough. Ikari summons a knife, and points it at her heart. "I—Ikari?!! Don't..!" said Jomi as Ikari stabbed herself. "Oh. That's how it feels." said Ikari as she falls into Jomi's arms. "Ikari..? Ok, you're not dead. I can still revive you, ok.." said Jomi as she healed Ikari, bringing her back to life. 

"Thanks. I just.. wanted to feel what it feels like. The stimuli.." said Ikari, as she stood up and put the knife away. "It's.. it's.. so tempting. I finally get what I deserve." continued Ikari, as she dragged Jomi back with her to the funeral as Lauvielle was looking at her. "Ikari. You need to hear this." said Lauvielle as Ikari looked at her with a glare. "Go ahead. Hmph." said Ikari, as Lauvielle looked at Jomi all concerned, before turning her look to the other people in the funeral.

"Hello everyone, I am Lauvielle De Luz. A friend of Mijo. You might know me for a couple of things, you might've talked to me once even. I made friends with Mijo back then. When I was with.. a certain person here right now by the name of LV, but anyway, throughout it all, he has always been caring and friendly. He respected my boundaries, he always gave us the choice. I don't know how deeply he was affected by my issues, but now I realize I should've considered that he could be lying. But at the same time, he did choose to lie about his feelings, so I don't know how to feel about that. We were so close back then, but now..? I don't think he viewed me as particularly close to him, since I have many friends, he assumed that one going and gone wouldn't hurt as much, considering my situation with IK. But.. it really did, losing someone who was as positive and optimistic as that to depression? It.. broke me. I.. have a lot to think about, excuse me for being so long. I'm.. sorry, Mijo. Please come back.." said Lauvielle, before stepping out and crying.

Soon after, other people stood up and talked, JR, Leviente, Urda and Jamise. But it felt blurry to Jomi, who was still watching the whole thing. When Mijo's elemental appeared beside her, she wasn't surprised. "Mijo.. what can I do to bring you back to your body, I will do anything." murmured Jomi to Mijo, as Mijo went close to her and whispered, "Jomi.. This feels like a dream." said Mijo, as Jomi looked at him and nodded. "Yeah, I know.. But it isn't. You are dead."

"No. Like, it's a dream. If I die, why would I come back as a ghost thingy with magical properties to talk to you? Unless.. this is a dream. I mean, do you think I am real and not just you coping about my death?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked at him and responded, "As long as I can speak to you.." Mijo looked down, then looked around. "Well if that's the case.." said Mijo, before he started to coalesce his magical form into a physical one. "I don't know how to do this, but with the power of dream magic, I can."

"M—Mijo..? You can.. so.." said Jomi as she was speechless. "I'm right. Only this time though, because I am the main subject of this dream. Once I wake up, you and the others will." explained Mijo, as he manifested a pistol. "Hmm.. if I shoot myself.. again, would I die a second death? Oh well." said Mijo, before shooting himself, ignoring the objections of Jomi right beside him.

Jomi wakes up screaming, "MIJOOOO!!!" as she sees a bedroom, with her sitting on a chair. Mijo and Rhida are also stirring awake beside her, dazed. "Mijo..? Mijo!" said Rhida as she hugged Mijo. Jomi looked at the two and joined them. "Oh. Thanks. You don't know how much I.. wanted this." said Mijo as they hugged for a while.

They all pulled back as Rhida blushed a bit. "I.. uh.. didn't.. I just needed to know you were fine.." Rhida turned to Jomi. "Um, Jomi, did you experience a dream? A dream where.. he.. died?" asked Rhida as Jomi nodded. "I.. yes. Yes, I did.. Mijo, you did too?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, concerned. 

"Well. Yeah. It's actually my dream, well.. like.. more like the host dream.. You get me? But basically, you were all dreaming in one dream that I had control over.. It's.. an interesting concept that I thought of before.. But seeing it firsthand..? That's nice." answered Mijo before he took a deep breath and looked at Jomi. "Oh and uh.. um.. yeah. I.. still have my.. issues there.. Although, what I said, still is true to some extent." continued Mijo, as Rhida turned to Jomi, curious. "Oh. Well. Basically, it's.. his story." said Jomi before continuing to explain what Mijo meant and what Mijo told her before she went to the podium.

"Oh. oh.. I.. see. So.. so.. It's like that." said Rhida as she processed Mijo's words about her. "Yeah. I am sorry I just.. don't share much. I learn.. to.. keep it to myself. It's.. inherent to me.. I've been doing this.. bad habit for too long." added Mijo, as Rhida nodded and looked at him. "You promise, you won't.. kill yourself? E—even if.. I can't be around..?" asked Rhida as Mijo nodded. 

"I.. I won't.. ok? No matter how deep and unending this.. hole I keep digging myself into.. I'll never give up alright? Just, sometimes.. sometimes.. I won't be as.. good. I.. won't be myself.. I will fall and fall.. into whatever I always do, failing. Sometimes, I.. might just.. isolate.. or.. collapse.. but, I will never, ever take my own life. If.. I may die, that is going to be in battle." answered Mijo as he hugged Rhida. "I.. trust you, ok? Now.. stay strong out there love.. We can meet.. there's always a tomorrow.. You understand this, don't you?" responded Rhida as Mijo answered, "Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you, my love, Rhida."

They hugged for a while, as Jomi watched, her heart fluttering at the sight of the two lovebirds. Eventually they pull back, and Jomi speaks up, "Alright. You two, we have.. a lot of people to talk to, and some research on what caused this dream.." said Jomi as the two nodded and they headed out.

_Hours later, Mijo is walking around with Jomi as they say goodbye to Rhida_

"Goodbye! Love! See you next week!" said Mijo as Jomi waves goodbye to Rhida. As they watched her leave, Ikari approached them with a blank expression. "Oh? Ikari! What's.. going on?" asked Mijo, as Ikari looked at Jomi then to Mijo. "Well, we're alive.." said Ikari as Mijo asked, "You're talking about the dream.. aren't you?" asked Mijo as Ikari nodded. "Yeah, I am." responded Ikari as she looked at Jomi before looking at Mijo again. 

"Here's the thing. I may have some.. reflection to go on. But, I do hope you understand, just.. stay safe bro. That.. fucking Lauvielle.You don't need to worry. I will take care of it. So, no dying.. as our teacher always said. See you, and Jomi?" continued Ikari, as she looked at Jomi. "Take care of this guy hah?" exclaimed Ikari before she left. 

"Oh.. I saw her. Sheesh. But, I understand." said Mijo as Jomi nodded. "Yeah, seems you two are connected very much. Best friends. Such a shame that.. best friend trio had to break." commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "I know. I'll.. just have to see what happens, then." said Mijo as Jomi looked at him, with a grin. "Alright. Guess you're not dying today, come on. Let's enjoy a couple more games, then you go home." said Jomi as Mijo smiled and they went back to walk around the city.

<!--REALIZATION SETTING IN LIKE A HURRICANE THROUGH THE HAZE!!!-->
<p id="SS3"><md-block># DeltaRambles: A Light that Never Comes</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo, during the most stressful weekday and weekend of his life, is walking around the light world, hoping for a light that never comes, so he wonders what to do in his walk across the world, as both the hero of the dark world and student of Honrato.

## Author's Note:

If you thought A Confession of A Thousand Cuts was a vent chapter, this one definitely is. It doesn't even feature any speaking from Jomi, only Mijo (mainly).

Should you be concerned? Maybe, but let the story speak before judging. As I always said, everything here is written from somewhere right? Whether that be my latest game addiction or school life, this is me.

Anyways, enjoy this heavy angst again. It's been my life ever since the start of the school year.

"I confess.." said Mijo as he looked at the grave of his grandfather. "that I have failed. In my thoughts, words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do." continued Mijo as every single repressed thought, emotion and event that he was keeping inside was let out. "Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault." said Mijo, as he couldn't surpress his intense sadness anymore. Before he could continue, he broke down in tears alone. He quickly got his handkerchief and used it before his father, June arrived.

"Hey Mijo, so I just finished cleaning the grave of your grand-grandfather, you want to look?" asked June, as Mijo nodded. They headed to his grand-grandfather, and as they walked, Mijo couldn't help but feel alone, even though his father was literally right next to him. "Dammit.. DAMMIT! Why.. why.. am I so alone..? It's.. it's not true! And yet.. why do I feel like it?" thought Mijo as they finished walking. 

They looked at it for a while, as June talked about stuff that Mijo barely paid attention to, responding in "Mhm.." and "Yeah." He was focused on his own thoughts, as much as he hated that. He couldn't form a coherent one though, his thoughts swirling on and on with June and his life. Eventually, they left and went back to the tricycle.

As they walked, Mijo finally got some alone time to himself, as June was speaking to some kid about painting the graves back to it's pristine white paint. He was pretty much in his own world, watching the situation unfold. This momentarily distracted him from his current predicament as he watched his father outsource labour to kids looking for a job to do during the weekends and _undás_ season.

Eventually they returned to their house again. As Mijo showered, he wondered to himself, "You know what.. I've.. I've been hurting myself for too long. I hate not.. pleasing others, but for my sake.. It's only fair I make my own decisions." before putting on some heavy metal music. "THE KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM PEOPLE SITTING AROUND ALL DAY! WHO can believe you? WHO can believe you? Let your mother pray..!" sang Mijo, while listening. He picked up a long comb and used it as a mic. "I sit, in a desolate room. No lights, no music.. JUST ANGER! I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better!!" continued Mijo, before he finished showering.

Afterwards, Mijo dressed up again and headed with his father, June and his other uncles to an old property that his grandfather inherited. They were in a van as they rode through the roads of Cab City and beyond. As they drove through, Mijo thought about his life once more, the conversations surrounding him blurring into the background.

"I am tired of.. being sad. But, it's what I've been feeling for the past few weeks. I can't give up, of course. But, when I try.. I try hard.. Everyone around me thinks, 'You can do better.' But.. I already am." thought Mijo, as buildings and vehicles passed him by in an instant. "I hate being forced. I literally hate it. No matter what I do, if I am forced to, it's going to turn out horrible. Like Math, English, any fudging subject in that prison I call, Honrato Science High School." continued Mijo, as he turned away and laid his head on the headrest, looking up to the vehicle's roof.

Mijo suddenly shot up again, and looked at the surrounding buildings and vehicles. "The worst part? THE FUDGING WORST PART? It especially hurts when English, ESP, AP and especially Español are lower than the supposed desired grade of 90, when I've been in fucking magical fantastical worlds that have their own lives, cultures, traditions, technology, language and magic! Nothing beyond that dark world can amount to anything that I've poured my hard work over." muttered Mijo as he clenched his fists. "I am the light bringer, the king of the prophecy, the first knight of Jomi's Kingdom of the Dark, the hero of Dajovy, the leader of the Dark Pearl and the saviour of Scians-Chemistra!" continued Mijo, as memories of his adventures flashed before his eyes while they continued driving.

"I know. I KNOW that, my life is inherently harder in the dark world, more responsibilities, more management.. But you know what? At least it's better than my shitty school life. I have Jomi, Rhida, all my friends, in the dark world, and they're happier! It.. It's just.. I don't know what's worth.. fighting for. I feel lost. It feels like I'm paranoid, because I feel the world's coming down on me, and at least, at least.. in the dark world, these threats and negative influences, I have the strength.. the power! Here, in the light world? Where? Because everywhere I stand, look, it feels like someone is managing me, someone is controlling me, I want to be my own person! I just.. want to be happy." said Mijo, as they stopped at a nearby church.

The moments felt like flashing lights, as he was blasted with what felt like his awakening, he didn't know why or how, but he was slowly becoming more confident. The afternoon passes like Rhida hurriedly running to somewhere as Mijo sees her, and she disappears upon a flash. Happiness for a little, but as soon as the party dies down, the reality of most of the days of your life sets in.

Eventually, he's just on his phone at his house, when one of his uncles, April is doing something on his computer. "You know, Mijo.. I've been observing you and what your uncles, aunts and your father have been saying about you." said April as he was playing some chill love pop music. "Oh, uh.. yeah." said Mijo, in his usual outward tone, reserved and quiet.

"Here's my advice, just.. enjoy life y'know. Not as in staying inside here, but just.. going outside, talking to friends.. It's your teenage life. Make sure you really hone in and focus on your enjoyment. You can't be happy with yourself if you sink yourself into the internet and your studies, right?" said April, as Mijo started to tear up, he held back his tears, not wanting to stop his ramble.

"Back in my day, I was the wild one, always going out, always.. walking around the city at night. I mean, sometimes we would even party, drink, smoke! Although, I don't recommend it. Point is, just have fun. These studies, while they matter, what would you have and reflect on the next decade?" continued April, before going silent as Mijo nodded, his breathing becoming heavier, his nose clogging up.

"I mean, just look at me, while I am happy for my children whom are graduating and successful, me? I spent the better part of 31 years in some other country working tirelessly, and what do I get? Well, my children are all grown up, but I didn't see them grow, nor did I see the country grow. Well, I did, but it was through the internet and far-away communication.." said April, as Mijo clenched his fists and bit his lip, stifling what he felt inside.

"When I left, I was considered an average adult, but now returning? A fucking senior citizen. You know how crazy that is? 30 years.. has changed, and only now am I taking up old hobbies, and supporting my children in whatever." continued April, as Mijo nodded, looking around him.

"You know, through it all, I have always maintained a sense of determination and happiness, even with the grueling conditions of a so-called 'skilled' worker in these countries. With the advent of the internet, comes the internet chatrooms, you know, right now, this.. program? StefalTalk? Me and my friends hang out there, we have a chatroom to just sing and enjoy while sometimes I go to big chatrooms with rich owners. I'm sure you know about this, but I'm just reminding you, we too do that messaging thing, unlike your grandpappy. He was too old for that kind of techy stuff before he died." continued April, as Mijo chuckled a bit.

"Oh, and another thing. Learn to drive, Mijo. This city? City-wide public transport is a dream, and honestly..? If I live in.. 5 years or so, and you and your generation managed to change that? That'll be amazing, but for now, you gotta learn to drive. It's another part of being independent, y'know. Learning to drive is learning to travel across the city, to your friends, malls, parties, whatever you desire, without stingy parents, amiright.. haha.. I know, it's bad as a parent to two kids to say it, but as long as you don't do anything dangerous and illegal, I'm fine with it. Hell I care, I am the smoker of my siblings, so I don't care much." said April, as Mijo nodded, his thoughts clearing a bit.

The two stayed silent for a minute before June called Mijo to dinner. "Mijo, dinner's ready." said June as Mijo nodded and headed to eat as June joined April in revising April's identification papers.

As Mijo silently ate on his own, he formulated his thoughts. "I.. understand everything. Every single word. I want to be independent, I want to be free, I want to be myself. It's just..." said Mijo before dropping his spoon at his food, as he remembered every time he made a mistake, whether as small as a simple accidental shove to someone, or as big as a quiz failing due to him emotionally collapsing inside. "I.. I... can't... break out of it. I hope that someday, someday I'll be the person I want to be, both worlds. But, I am losing it all.. I've been falling for quite a while." said Mijo as he started to heavily breathe.

"The light.. I.. see it, in the distance.. I try to move to it, grab it, run to it, anything! Where.. am I going? Is.. is my life.. doomed to be always sad..? A little happiness on the side, depression most of the time? I'm so tired.. I just want to rest.. forever. Deepest memories of.. nothing. It's like forcing a traumatized veteran to go to war again. It's.. I.. I.. have seen this.. before. Jomi, she.. she's like me. I hate saying I relate or we have the same.. issues, since she was mentally tortured and abused by a malevolent entity, while mine is more abstract and less black and white, yin and yang." continued Mijo, as he continued to eat, tears forming.

"Sometimes, I just.. I just wanna say, 'I am lost, and I don't need your help. I need you to help the world around me. Don't focus on the sad, lonely, depressed person, focus on the school and the society that makes that person depressed.' But.. without a lot.. of power, it's simply wishful thinking. I hate being triggered by every damn fucking thing that reminds me of  my.. my trauma. I hate calling it that, because it says the truth. I have a lot of breakage as a person that is simply lost in my own delusions.. I bet if I go to the dark world, Jomi will distract me with work, which is fine, and.. unfortunately that's all she can do." said Mijo, as he almost finished eating.

"I'm stuck here. I was born as a lightner, so with great power comes great responsibility and pain. Things pass like an instant, that dance with Rhida.. a memory long ago, even though it was just a year ago.. That first cataclysm.. only 2 years ago, and yet I felt as powerless as I did during that situation now even though if that ever happened, we are simply better so they'll lose." said Mijo, as he finished eating and headed off to clean it.

"I just.. don't want to be hurt.. anymore. I hurt myself inside more than I ever wanted to.. It's.. only compounded by the realization I am wasting my life. Wasting away these precious seconds to heal, when it gets wounded the second the alarm rings on a monday morning. I feel like.. no matter what, I can never heal, it's a continuous cycle of abuse until I give up. But, I have to prioritize myself. It's no use being.. this used. I HAVE TO FIGHT!" said Mijo, as he finished cleaning and put it back as he went to the backyard to stare at the night.

"I'M BREAKING THE HABIT. I'LL CHASE THAT LIGHT UNTIL I DIE. AT LEAST THEN, I'LL HAVE DIED FIGHTING DEMONS. I'LL HAVE DIED UNDER THE DARK NIGHT KNOWING I DIDN'T REGRET WHAT I'VE DONE. I'LL FIGHT. FOR MYSELF AND NOT AGAINST MYSELF, ANYMORE!" shouted Mijo, as he raised his fists on the dark skies of the shaded night. "FUCK EVERYONE THAT IS PULLING ME DOWN! FACE IT DAMMIT. EVEN IF I HURT AND GET BEATEN, I'll fight. I'LL FIGHT!!" continued Mijo, as he finally calmed down. "_Let's dance_." said Mijo, before leaving, with a determined look.

## Author's Note:

## Summary:

Mijo is mentally unstable now, after enduring his own pain for weeks, he decided to go off at his friends, wanting to express everything he hated about everything.

Venting post, but a lil' twist.

---

"I.. don't know what to do. I just want to rest.." said Mijo as he looked at the dark world with contempt. He doesn't particularly hate what he's looking at but rather the world outside of it. "Fuck them." said Mijo as he started to stride confidently, he's gotten tired of... everything really, and he's itching to let it out. But unlike last time, he's done hurting himself.

"You know what, what about her? She seems to be oh so perfect. Why don't I pay her a visit?" said Mijo, as he walks to Jomi's castle with no intention to be courteous and friendly to his other self. "Jomi..? She can take it." said Mijo, as he unsheathed his sword. 

_Meanwhile, at Jomi's bedroom_

"I.. don't know what to say, Rhida. It's just been a tough time for him these past few weeks. He hasn't told you, no? Yeah, his.. situation.. has been mentally taxing for him. That's why he's been.. particularly self.. loathing these past few weeks." said Jomi, as Rhida nodded in understanding. 

"I see.. I have just been worried about him, Jomi.. I wanted to meet with him, but he seemed busy... During Tuesdays.. Well, even in our tumultuous week, I quickly took a peek at their classroom.. He.. I can't describe it well, I only saw him and his expression for a moment.. But he seemed... out of it. Like.. you know back then when he got possessed by Cara? Oh right.. You weren't there.. But that's besides the point. I just—" said Rhida before the door behind them bursts open and it's Mijo with a sword.

"Hello there..! It's me! Mijo! Your favorite swordsman! Now, let me.." said Mijo in a maniacal voice as he closed the door behind him. "There we go. Now, now.. Oh hi Rhida! Didn't expect you to be here, I wasn't expecting an advanced reunion.. Well, I suppose that won't matter. After this, I don't think you'd want to meet me anymore..!" said Mijo, as he pointed the sword at them.

Jomi and Rhida widened their eyes as Jomi put herself between Mijo and Rhida. "What are you planning..? I.. don't want you to keep hurting Mijo, but.. please put the sword down. Whatever you do, please.. don't do it the sword way." said Jomi, as she prepared her own sword as Rhida stayed behind, keeping her mouth shut to see how the confrontation unfolds. 

"I.. realized does it matter if I hurt them physically when I already hurt them mentally? I know your usual musings about me.. Oh he's isolating.. Oh he's cold.. He's too emotional.. Oh what happened to him? Oh he's not himself, I've gotta fix him. Discipline him until he's obedient.. Hahaha!!! I am tired of acting like I don't mind it, trying to keep my mouth so quiet.. But sitting there.. just *SEEMS TO AMPLIFY IT?!!?*" said Mijo as he clashed blades with Jomi.

"Mijo!" said Rhida and Jomi, as Jomi and Mijo continued pressing their blades to each other. "Pointless. If I wanted you to die, you would've already been." said Mijo, as he pressed his blade harder, the material on both blades struggling to keep up. "Mijo..! Stop..! You can express this in different ways!" said Jomi before Mijo smiled and teleported them to a different area.

Rhida gasped as they were teleported outside of Jomi's bedroom. "W—where did they go..? Wait..! I think I know the exact place.." said Rhida as she hurriedly ran out and headed to the training ground.

_Training ground_

"Fight me! Fight me..!!" said Mijo as they clashed blades, both are holding back their strength, for different reasons. "What's with you, Jomi? Can't go hard on your friend? Well, I'm not your friend anymore!" said Mijo as he intensified his assault. "Stop..! Eventually, you're going to do something you'll regret!" said Jomi as she continued to keep up with Mijo, trying her best not to harm him. "My regrets? Like I had any more I can add..! At least this time, it's not just.. someone's opinions and feelings that personally hurt me, this time.. **_I will be responsible, and there's no doubt about that._**" said Mijo as he managed to deflect an attack from Jomi and pin her to a wall.

Mijo is using an energy sword against Jomi's throat as she looks at him, pleading. "Mijo.. Please.. I understand your pain, your hatred.. I try to.. at least. You don't really want to do this, do you? I can see the conflict.. You.. just want to express yourself without judgement.. I do too.." said Jomi as Mijo visibly is shaken but keeps the sword at her throat. "Abusing my goodwill to you.. This is what people think whenever they hear about what I have done to you this afternoon. But, honestly..? I haven't cared in a while." said Mijo as he pressed it at Jomi's throat, making her bleed a bit. The fear and concern on Jomi's eyes is palpable, while Mijo's maniacal face is hiding whatever he's truly thinking.

"Mijo! Stop this right now. I.. will have no choice but to stop you, to prevent you from hurting Jomi and yourself, again." said Rhida sternly, as she held up her ice sword and seems to be casting something. Mijo chuckled as he used the sword to cut the neckline of Jomi's dress, exposing her bra a bit. He moved to cut the straps of the bra as well before making a huge cut on the skin of her top, before pushing her down. "Mijo..?" said Jomi as she held her arms close to her chest, due to the exposure and bleeding. "Now.. time to reveal my secret~" said Mijo as he took off his jacket right in front of the two, revealing his own cuts to his arms. 

The two were immediately shocked at the revelation as he moved his head around, preparing himself for something. "Mijo..! What did you do?!" said Jomi in reaction to his self-harm as well as what he did to her. "Mijo..! I.. what..?" said Rhida as she lowered her weapon for a bit, she was in shock of what Mijo did to himself. "I know what you're thinking.. Oh how terrible, you're hurt..! But, I'm not here to get your sympathy. It's all fake anyway. Guilt me all you want. Fine. Add on to this scar-filled body. We'll see how much it can take, how much wounds it can add before it breaks, and I bleed until I die." said Mijo as he looked at his arms, then to the two.

Jomi stood up, picking up her blade as he moved to Rhida's side, still holding her dress up to not be completely exposed. "Jomi..! Did he.." trailed off Rhida as she is very conflicted on what to think of Mijo. "Yeah.. D—dont worry.. please, I.. know this looks horrible, even depraved coming from Mijo, but.. I don't think he does this to me, without reason.. Hold on, I'll heal myself. You.. talk to him, keep him sane, just for a little while longer." explained Jomi as she casts a spell to heal and repair her clothes.

"Okay.. Mijo..?" said Rhida, as she held her sword again at Mijo. "Mmm.. I heard it. And you know what? Maybe I am just a depraved insane psychopath hidden beneath my façade.. Maybe this is just the real me, have you ever thought about that, Rhida?" said Mijo, as he held his sword at Rhida too. "I.. know this isn't you. At least, not the healthy you. I know you've always been self-destructive, self-sacrificial and a person with empathy to other people.. I just.. think that you lost your care somewhere in the way of our life.." said Rhida, as Mijo widnened his eyes and smiled. "I lost that? Hmm.. keen eye. I knew you were observing me even without my input. Ah well, too late." said Mijo as he starts to feel the effects of his self-harm, feeling hazy and numb to his surrounndings.

"Whew.. I need to finish this." said Mijo as he charged his sword and attacked Rhida. She tried to dodge then block his attack, but Mijo was quick and managed to shatter her ice sword, and put her down to the floor. "Now, let me finish this destruction of my social and love life, once I hurt you, you will never love me again." said Mijo as he used his sword to threaten and cut Rhida's dress, revealing her almost naked body underneath. "That's enough." said Mijo, before he smiled at Rhida then teleported away.

_Jomi's Castle Balcony, overlooking Dajovy City_

"Well.. well.. Mijo, you've done it! You've ruined your only lifeline, what now? Kill yourself?" said Mijo to himself, as he looked at his sword. "I wish.. But, I'm not sure if I would be able to be revived after I kill myself. And I don't want to attempt something I'm not a one hundred percent sure guranteed death. Maybe there's a part of me that wants to live, I just don't know if they have good intentions." responded Mijo to himself, as he caresses the blade, tempted to switch to the sharp end.

"Can you really go back here? Especially to Rhida, you hurt her. If Jomi doesn't at least not look at you the same sane way.. That's a win." questioned Mijo as he put the blade at his throat. "I need.. more power. But not here. I need to get out and start asserting myself. Hurt everyone on the way if it means I don't add on to the pain." continued Mijo as he further ran the blade through his skin, the blunt end. He needs to at least keep his arms functional for any interruption.

"I really need to sleep.." murmured Mijo to himself, as he looked at his phone he left here before going to Jomi. It was 00:10, late at midnight. "Huh, must've been a while since I confronted the two. About.. five hours ago? Anyways, no one except those two know, the problems remain.. I just.. hope tomorrow.. will be better." said Mijo, his clarity showing and mania fading due to his mental exhaustion. "See you, Dajovy, the dark world, Jomi.. and Rhida. You'll hate me, but.. soon, you'll forget." said Mijo, before he left Jomi's Castle Balcony.

_Next day, morning, Rhida is sitting on a bench at the gymnasium, looking at the fellow students around her_

'Mijo.. I don't know what to feel about you..' thought Rhida as she looked at Mijo, looking off somewhere else. 'W—what you did..? I.. didn't think you would be capable of such acts..' continued Rhida as she looked at her body. 'I still remember.. your sadistic look.. It wasn't.. I.. don't believe it's you. But, for my own safety.. I think Jomi should.. you wouldn't kill her right?' Rhida was tapped on the shoulder by her friend, Diminaque. "Hey, look at that guy, amazing right?" said Diminaque, to a random male student at the stage, acting his heart out for a school film viewing promotion.

"Oh, yeah.. Haha..!" said Rhida, as she chuckled a bit. 'These times.. I have good friends, good grades.. But, I'm just... worried about him. I don't want him to fall.. to the abyss. Well, I'll just have to see later, I have to go to that meeting, as well as practice that speech.." thought Rhida, as she looked at Mijo and sighed.

_Later, at 16:00, Mijo visits Jomi's Castle, he arrives at Jomi's bedroom_

"I'm here. Don't be scared. Or be scared.. Just.. don't kick me out. I know you want to talk to me." said Mijo, to Jomi's bedroom door. "Come in. But promise not to.. undress me, okay? You know it's a horrible action, that's why you did it." said Jomi, as Mijo opened the door and closed it, seeing a Jomi in her usual pajamas, with some books lying around.

"You want me to say I'm sorry, don't you?" asked Mijo as he sat down beside Jomi. "Yeah. But, what about it? Don't you feel apologetic?" retorted Jomi, as Mijo looked away and nodded. "Yeah, whatever. I know it was a horrible act. I knew it would.. hurt you two. Something unforgivable to validate my own self-hatred." said Mijo as he looked at his arms. "I intentionally didn't heal these. Why would my pain matter? It's been hurting inside mentally for a while now.. Why would physical pain be any worse? Of course, I still have to keep up the façade outside, so that's why cuts are the best for this." commented Mijo, as he touched his arms, making him recoil a bit.

"Is it visible outside, as in.. the light world, or only here?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed at her. "Of course not visible. I hide my pain as much as I can, okay? But.. even if that's the case, everywhere I go, the mental instability remains the same." said Mijo, as he covered up his arms using Jomi's blanket. "I know you're not fine. But, if anyone else asks you, are you good?" questioned Jomi, as she put her hand on his shoulder.

"No.. I should.. say no. But, I'm scared of just trying to explain why. I.. don't want to be the center of attention, but.. I also want validation. The reason I'm.. just comfortable with you, and Rhida now.. is because I know you won't resent me forever. That might be too late now though.. for Rhida.." answered Mijo, as he shed a tear. 

"I.. get it. I mean, I'm a princess right? So I gotta maintain this sense of beauty, courteousness and strong will to manage the country without many enemies.. But, it's been exhausting, so I try to truly display myself, as just that, myself. But, of course.. not everyone likes me, so.. there's always judgement.. But, I have you, the Dark Pearl, and my close royal court. Do you have anyone you think you can be comfortable like this? Except me, of course." said Jomi, as Mijo shook his head.

"I say that I do, but.. that would be lying. I would be lying if I said I was comfortable with sharing these emotions of mine. I'm not. In fact, I have to be sure that today I won't collapse and break down.." said Mijo, as he laid his head on her shoulder. "I.." trailed off Jomi, as she stroked his hair. "I don't want you to feel sympathy for a guy who forcefully undressed two girls. I'm just looking for someone to actually understand and help me.. But no one will." said Mijo, as his tears started to fall.

"N—no one will..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo looked at her and sadly nodded. "I.. don't want to feel like this. Like I'm so spoiled and ungrateful for what I have that I expect more from everyone around me.. But.. I just wished that they understood that I'm.. different." continued Mijo, as he wiped his tears. "I don't want to be different.. But I am..! I can't change who I am like that! I'm just.. so powerless, helpless! It's so sad." said Mijo, as he held his arm and pressed on it, making it bleed out. 

"Mijo!" exclaimed Jomi as she stopped his arms, causing more bleeding since his entire arms are covered in scars. "Heal it if you must. I don't really value my life surviving until the next day. Of course, I have stuff I want to do before dying, but.. if I didn't even have a choice in my school life, who's to say I'd ever get there?" commented Mijo, as he leaned his body over to Jomi, while she healed the scars. "I have to. You cannot stay like this, beaten, broken and scarred. If I have to help you heal, so be it. You've stuck out for me at my lowest, so I should do the same." declared Jomi, as she uses the rest of her magic to continue healing Mijo, while Mijo lays down on her bed. After a while of intense magic use from Jomi, Mijo's scars finally heal as Jomi stops, breathing heavily.

"That.. I had to exert a lot.. A lot of it was deep.. Haha.. This.. means a lot, doesn't it, Mijo?" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah. Well, I already feel better. Thanks. I.. genuinely thank you." responded Mijo as he hugged her. "I.. you're.. no problem. I'm always here, for you. No matter how low we both go, we're here for each other right? We can't abandon each other, and we won't. Remember that." said Jomi as Mijo nodded and patted her back for a bit before they pulled back.

"I.." trailed off Mijo, before finally breaking down in front of Jomi. "I just.. it's.. been a while since I heard someone.. care about **me.**" said Mijo, as he carefully put away his sword and started hitting the mattress using his fists. "All I wanted.. is for someone.. anyone to hear me out. I don't need you and your advice.. I just want someone to care.. and.. I'm contradictory, aren't I?" continued Mijo, as he looked at Jomi, heavily breathing. "I.. want someone to care but I don't to be **judged?!** What is that, do I just want someone like **me?!** Incapable of speaking out and standing up for himself, and scared and fearful of my every **move?!**" shouted Mijo, as he smacked his head into one of Jomi's pillows.

"Haha.. It's like I am those rock artists.. Of course, I don't want to say that I had the same issues as these people but.. I get it. I get what they felt, the pain, the fame, the depression... All of it. I just.. I feel the same way about how alienated and disconnected I am from my school work sometimes, and like being forced to do a lot of the shit that I resent.. It's all of that, building endlessly until I die. The suicide option seems.. something only cornered people would do. I see two ways, and both end in isolation and with the intention to disappear." said Mijo, as he calmed himself down.

"Mijo.." said Jomi as she put her hand on her shoulder. "One, numbing myself to the pain and taking every opportunity to get some dopamine into my brain causing delirious euphoria.. or.. being so deep in lost memories that keep playing in a dark room that you eventually break and spiral.. These are the only two paths." said Mijo, as he looked visibly weary. 

"It's.. not. But, I.. see it in your eyes.. We're tired. It looks impossible now, or that the paths you see lead nowehere.. There's always a way.. to change. Even if all hell broke loose once again, if you live.. that's enough... Because, you'll get your way soon. Time is for you, and.. even if you die tomorrow? At least you would've died fighting. There's nothing else you can do anyway." said Jomi, as her eyes are half closed. "I'll think about that. Thank you again, Jomi." said Mijo before they hugged and went their separate ways for now.

_Next day, 19:00, in front of Jomi's bedroom_

"Hey, it's me again." said Mijo, as Jomi opened the door. "Oh.. hi! Come in, I just finished my work for today." said Jomi as Mijo went inside and closed the door. Mijo sat down and laid on her bed. "I'm so tired.." said Mijo as he looked around him. "Yeah, Rhida told me the whole school is busy this week, and the next week.. the next week.. exams.. yeah, the next two weeks aren't going to be exactly a walk in the park for you.. Though your walks in the park aren't even full of leisure,.. haha.." responded Jomi, as Mijo nodded in agreement. "Yep.. I'm probably not going to stop going here.. The events that have happened and that will happpen are going to impact me in a way that I need you.." said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and tilted her head.

"That's good to hear. Anyways, how's your healing journey?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shook his head. "Not going well. I'm grateful you're here, but.. like what I said before, way back.. As long as the trauma is still affecting me through the event still recurring then there is really nothing I can do but endure and try to survive." said Mijo, as he stroked his hair. "I.. understand. Have you decided on what to do today?" questioned Jomi as she stretched her legs and arms. "No.. But, Jomi.. there's just so much to do...! I.. have realized that I wasted my time.. no. I realize that.. either way I am screwed. I either freeze in one spot and don't enjoy myself, have fun but sacrifce school work, or do school work but my fun is ruined for the night, and I struggle to do it." said Mijo as he coughed a bit.

"I see.. yeah, we've talked about it before. Still what do you hope to change? It's about time you do it now, at least.. before you are forced to do it, anyway." questioned Jomi, as she played with her hair. "I.. don't even know anymore.. If I try to change, it's constantly bogged down by myself and the others around me.. The worst part is.. like before, it has always been cyclical. It's this cycle of pain that I have developed a sense of fear and deep mental stress.." answered Mijo, as he took off his glasses and buried his face into his hands. "Oh.. yeah. Before I met you, when me and Cara were in an abusive relationship with self-destructive goals of maintaining dominance.. Thinking about it, I just accepted the fact that I was always going to hurt, that Cara would be forever in my life.. She even decided to make a schedule that revolved around her pleasure in making me do a lot of things.. that I prefer not to be mentioned today. But, I don't want to make this about me, as you've already heard about it, the point is.. I get it." explained Jomi as she rubbed her hands together.

"Haha.. Even throughout the worlds.. You're really the only one who can get me.. fully understand me.. It makes sense. I guess, after seeing you and helping you before and during the first catacylsm.. It.. really put into perspective on how similar people's journey are through their life, even if not directly.. You are an obvious example, but.. as long as I accept that.. people can be different and have a different perspective on their life and experience.. Then I can be just like you.. like me again." commented Mijo, as he smirks and looks at Jomi. "From the most degenerate and depraved acts.. You understand. I hope others are.. as good as you.." added Mijo before he looked to the ceiling and took a huge sigh. "Thank you, Mijo." said Jomi as they hug together. They held tightly for a while before pulling back and waving goodbye to each other again.

<p id="SS5"><md-block># DeltaRambles: A Homage to Nuevo Leon</md-block>

### Author's Note:

I've been reading Orwell's book: 'Homage to Catalonia' and it's giving me ideas for S2, and I kinda just want to put them here, for funsies. Anyway, this originally started on August 29, 2025 @ 14:25, let's see where this takes me.

(By the way, I tried describing clothing related to the time, if it's anachronistic/incomprehensible, tell me, thanks! — Aug 30 | 23:56)

Oh and as a fair sidenote, I'm going to try to follow events historically, but of course, this is through some of Orwell's own memoir about his experience and some historical retrospective from the time. This is a fiction story, and so will have fictionalized events, and maybe I get some context wrong, I tried my best to research but if I get something wrong/you think it's way too much of a stretch, shoot me a message! It's a WIP of Season 2 anyway, and I'm just writing to see where this idea takes me.. — Aug 31 | 19:23

"Mis compañeros aligerado, you have arrived!" greeted Buenavi. "Ahaha.. yes, it is me.. uh.. Mijo." greeted Mijo back sheepishly. "And.." Buenavi looks at Jomi a bit more suspiciously but still waves at her. "y Princesa Jomi.. Hola." Jomi kindly waves back, she knows why she's been made suspicious. "Hola, Buenavi.. I'm just here to help him, haha.."

"What's the situation in Nuevo Leon?" asked Mijo, as Buenavi, instead of explaining, sighed and gave him a pamphlet.

---

**_¡FRENTE POPULAR!_**

¡El gobierno republicano ha sido atacado!

¡Por falangistas y generales rebeldes, han aprovechado varias tierras y están planeando convertir a España en Alemania de Hitler e Italia de Mussolini!

**¡Únete al frente popular!**

"Wow.. that's a lot.." commented Mijo as he and Jomi read the pamphlet. "¡Sí, camarade!" Buenavi nodded. "I.. have it on standby, because of Brigadas Internacionales.. y.. The Partido gave me a few copies." Buenavi looked around. "I'm P.O.U.M., sí tu were wondering.." said Buenavi as Mijo looked up, finally looking at the woman who was their tour guide in this mess. "Do you know of any 'aligerados extranjeros' who have arrived in.. uh.. what's this place called, if you don't mind me asking..?" asked Mijo, as Buenavi hummed in thought.

"Baselonya.." said Buenavi as she shook her head. "Baselonya.. That's the Cagalan way.. I'm from Samancala. It was taken over by those fascists and I escaped to Baselonya just as the revolución was happening." elaborated Buenavi, as Jomi asked, in a polite yet concerned manner. "Your name sounds like 'Buena Vista'.. Is that your actual name?" asked Jomi, as Buenavi shook her head. "Ah, no no.. por supuesto no.. It's a given name, uh.. for how much I say it when I arrive.. ah, porque I went here a lot before the guerra."

"Aaalright, so.. um.." Mijo looks around again. "I guess I can join the P.O.U.M. for now.. But, I don't need training, hm, Jomi.." Mijo looks at her. "Do you think my fantasy elemental magic works here??" whispered Mijo to Jomi, as Buenavi looked at them with slight enthusiasm yet confused at what they were so silent about. "M—maybe, but.. we need to figure out the situation and find your lightner friends first.. though.." Jomi points out to Mijo, as.. expected, carried what seems to be rifles and wore clothes of various proletariat that seemed to fit this time.

"Yikes, do they _use_ elemental magic, or..?" asked Mijo to Jomi, as Buenavi slowly approached them to eavesdrop. "Hey, um.. camarade Mijo?" asked Buenavi as Mijo looked at her, a bit irritated. "I'm not trying to pry o cualquier cosa.. Es solo.. sí tú quieres unirnos a nosotros.." Buenavi looks to the offices of the Brigadas Internacionales and other party offices. "We can go to the P.O.U.M. one, but.. I suggest trying that one first, we're all antifascistas here, es bien."

"Uh.. give us a moment, Buenavi. Lo siento, for not telling you why.. it's just something unbelievable if you're not in the context we're in." said Mijo, before going back to Jomi. Buenavi shrugged, "Vale, claro.. I'm just going to help in some of the repairs around here, ¡adíos! ¡Hasta la vista!" Buenavi waved goodbye before going on with her life as Mijo turned to Jomi again.

"Okay, let's try finding them.. But, have you noticed?" asked Mijo, as he ruffled Jomi's collared shirt underneath her new woolen jacket. "Hey! Wait—" Jomi holds Mijo's hand, but she's currently staring at her clothes with amazement. "What about you?" asked Jomi as Mijo pulled back and looked at himself. Jomi saw a faded black collared shirt with grey-ish corduroy trousers held up by a wide leather belt with a large belt buckle. Mijo is also wearing a black gorra (peaked cap) with a red star on the front.

"Nice. I scored the peak clothing one.." Mijo looks at Jomi's headwear, a small yellow tiara and a tied-up ponytail shows her.. much more bourgeois origins. "Eh, didn't know we could change like this immediately, thought we had to like.. get clothes that fit the time.." commented Jomi, before shaking her head. "A—anyway, we should get into a hotel, and then sign up." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and headed to a local hotel. "Hm, why not directly sign up?" asked Mijo to Jomi, as they both stopped.

"Mierda, right..." Jomi sighs. "I was going to ask, if I could like.. join you in the battle, like.. you know, unlike our usual fantasy adventures, this era is like the clash of 'traditional' women's role and a progressive one.." explained Jomi, as she looked around and saw militiawomen casually talking. "Not that I don't want to fight, but.. you get it?? I'm like overthinking here, am I?" added Jomi, as Mijo hummed in thought as they continued to walk to the hotel. 

"Well, if you want to, let's go fight!" Mijo looks around. "I dunno much about this era, but.. if this is what revolution looks like.." Mijo smiles at Jomi. "We're bound for equality. And we'll fight if you don't want to be forced into anything, okay princess~?" assured Mijo, as they started to walk to the Brigadas Internacionales office. "Hah, I'm not one here, though.. heh." replied Jomi as they continued to walk.

_Brigadas Internacionales Office._

"Let's look around.." said Mijo, as the two slowly walked and looked at the people recruiting and being recruited, from all walks of life in Baselonya, from bourgeois (mostly because militia got rations that had been expropriated from them) and the proletariat. "Wait— Rhida!!" exclaimed Mijo, as he saw Rhida, his.. 'girlfriend' (it's complicated). "Mijo?!" Mijo hugged her and she hugged back, as Jomi approached them with an awkward smile, turning to see Ikari and Lauvielle beside Rhida, a bit surprised.

"Hi, you two.. didn't expect you here.. Did you already sign up?" asked Jomi, as Ikari spoke up. "Sure, yeah.. Though, we had to improvise a bit.. you know.." Lauvielle added, "Basically, we come from the US, and arrived here through the promises of.. antifascism?? I think I got that from some guy, before we got here." Jomi nodded, as she turned to Mijo and Rhida now looking at the others. "Mijo, let's sign up." Jomi turns to the other three. "When's training?"

"Tomorrow.." spoke Rhida, as Mijo and Jomi nod and head to the recruitment officer.

"Hold up, Jomi, let me cook." said Mijo, as he cleared his throat. "¡Hola camarade! Nosotros desde Filipinas, pero vinimos aquí a través de los Estados Unidos." Mijo went closer. "¿Podemos unirnos a las brigadas internacionales?" asked Mijo, as the recruitment officer looked at him, then at Jomi then started writing. "Sí, camarade.. ¿Cuales sois vuestros nombres?" asked the officer as the two looked at each other then gave it.

"Vale, vale.." The officer was writing as he then went and got some paperwork and shifted through them while the two were awkwardly waiting, behind them other people joining, waiting impatiently. "Vale, los cuarteles están cerca aquí. Mañana, todos vosotros podéis comenzar su entrenamiento. ¡No pasarán!" said the officer, as the two nodded, and Mijo said it back to him before they left.

"We're done!" exclaimed Mijo excitedly, as Ikari smirked slightly. "I mean, I'm getting used to getting into formation a lot. In our light world, at least. Mijo, are you sure, like.. even if we do have our powers, you'll be able to handle training?" asked Ikari, as Jomi looked at Mijo, in thought. "It's.. going to be hard, and.. I'm going to hate it.. But, this is something new, guys.. Not just fighting fascism but also social revolution!" answered Mijo, as he looked around. "This. This is worth fighting for."

"Mijo, we.. both know how it ends.." said Jomi, as Mijo clenched his hands into fists. "I know. But hopefully we can change that, if we lose this.." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi. "We still have magic, yes? If we can still move from this dark world to the light world?" asked Mijo, as Jomi fiddles with her hair. "Um, we'll see.. but yeah, we should go to a hotel, at least for this day.."  answered Jomi, as everybody else nodded and headed outside.
