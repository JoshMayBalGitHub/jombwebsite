    # C1d DeltaRambles: Reunion de Avance

Deltarune-inspired story: ()

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees his best friend Urda. She was waiting on him, because there was a good project they had to do, so they went, and not so long class was over. But after a while of cleaning, they went home but before going, 

Mijo said "Yo, so i heard of this rumor that like near the you-know emerald room, there was like a whole dark world-" 

Urda said "You really think that deltarune exists for real!" 

Mijo said "Unlikely, but hey the probability's there." 

Urda said "Really, how do you even access it? The room's dark or its-"

Mijo cut off "Alright maybe its not really there, BUT! I mean its open, i think?"

Urda said "Really, huh?" "Well if you keep talking about it, seriously dude."

So after closing up the class, they went to the place and tested the doors.. They were open! They entered but it was dark... Too dark. 

Mijo said "Ok, but like lets check if the lights work"

Urda said "So what, you can fall and- Oh, he's gone."

Urda then thought about what would happen if she was asked where Mijo could have gone or more boring days of school, and so she went in, but as soon as she went in she fell and the door closed.

*dark world shenanigans*

Draft Notes: Full of Grammar mistakes and general confusing execution but this is from the original one wrote so from this point i rewrite again.

Summary: A secret hidden in the very top... Mijo and Urda discover new worlds and people?!?! 

Author's Note: Deltarune-inspired story but also taglish all around, also I am kinda not proud of this but the premise is good... I will just write the other parts, see where this goes. BTW the title is from miting de avance which is the filipino version of advanced meeting from my HCPSMSHS Election Days.
    
Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical Honrato student is. Anyway he sees Urda, a random classmate. She was waiting on him, because there was a project they had to do, so they went to the classroom,
and after a while, when it was near lunch, they got an opportunity to go home when the teacher announced:

Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayong 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-" 

Mijo said and everyone said "WOOO UWIAN NA!!!"

So, it was time to go home but Mijo's and Urda's service wasn't here yet and after going to the waiting shed- Suddenly, darkness explodes and it looks like it's near the Fajado Building, near their classroom.

Mijo said "Ooo, its interesting, but it's probably dangerous, but YOLO i guess..." 

Urda quickly cut in and said "Hoy! Mijo diba?"

Mijo surprised, said "Uh, yeah, Hey you wanna go to our classroom?"

Urda shocked, said "Bro, really?" paused and said "Hindi ako pupunta malapit don PERO I am warning you!"

Mijo said "Good point, but-"

But then the darkness expanded and soon the floor was no longer safe. Mijo, sensing something was about to happen, quickly rushed to Urda.

Mijo said "Oh shiiit, this might be our last day..."

Urda said "Well, kung ito ay ang parang alam ko, magiging somewhat okey tayo."

Mijo said "Huh? What does that mean?"

Suddenly the ground shook with fear and they fell to the darkness...

Mijo woke up in the eternal darkness with only a platform. Surprisingly, the fall wasn't that bad. But he decided to stand up and look around. Oceans of darkness are all around and only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and after seeing weird black goop, he saw a bunch of cabinets and tables, perfect for hiding, and so he went there and as he was walking very loudly, he heard *someone*... So he readied up his sword (wait he had one?) and stay cautioned, ready for whoever was making that sound and suddenly Urda showed herself with a sword and flintlock pistol. 

"HEY! Who are you! Wait-" said Urda, surprised.

"OH, ay nako it's just you..." said Mijo, also surprised.

"DAMN... Malapit na kitang barilin! Dapat meron kang sinabi..." said Urda apologetically.

"Yeah, woops sorry!! Well what do we do now???" said Mijo, as he put his sword away.

"Huh, waait a minute... Meron ka lang espada... Ako merong espada AT baril!" said Urda, mockingly.

"Well, that doesnt matter, i can deflect your bullets with my sh-" but there wasn't a shield in his inventory... "-sword! Yeah.. my sword.." said Mijo embarrassed.

"Haha! But ok punta kaya tayo, uh doon?" said Urda, pointing towards the only path not going backwards. 

"Aight, let's go!" said Mijo.

They went together towards the darkness and after walking a lot, they saw a school that had like a gate and guardhouse like Honrato! 

"Yo! We found something! Its honrato?" Mijo said, very confused.

"Whaat? Uh nakikita mo ba na may tao?" Urda said, also confused.

"No... Can we go in?" said Mijo confirming.

"Kung hindi, meron tayong.... isa pang opsyon."
said Urda, pointing to her gun. 

"Sure. But like we DON'T have to... I'll join you though if it ever comes to that however.. " said Mijo, thinking about it.

"Fiiine... Sisiguraduhin mabait ako... Sa kanila..." Urda said, whining.

So they went in, and the gate opened for them.

"Ok???" Mijo said, being confused at the whole situation. Urda kept quiet, silently observing everything.

They turned towards the gym and saw everyone! 

"Uh..." Mijo said, then saw a person and said "Hi! Do you know- wait he is just.. ignoring me!" Hey!" Mijo said, getting more anxious decided to ignore it and move towards the gym but then time quicky flew by from 3:00 PM to 5:05 PM.
As fast as they walked in, it was suddenly time to leave.

Urda spoke up. "Ayah, ano ang nangyayari dito? Puro nakakabaliw na nakikita natin, siguro meron nangyari satin ah, Mijo?"

Mijo rebutted, "Well, right ka, nahulog tayo papunta sa dilim, but kasi kung namatay tayo, dapat ba kaya merong tayong makikitang demonyo dito?"

Urda answered, "Luh, baga ito ang personal na hell sa atin-"

Mijo interrupted, "O pwede itong yung... Alam mo yung runedelta?"

Urda said, "Yeah, you uh keep talking to me about it, so i rewatched some of it."

Mijo said, "Oops, well, hopefully useful naman ang na-aral ko don... Wait.. kung galing sa Fajado, then magsearch tayo don..."

In response Urda said, "OK!"

But she continued to wonder if she was the one controlling time as, she was looking at the clock and it was moving wherever she thinks, 5,4,3 PM, anything really but it was kinda liberating, but she needed to find out how it works...

Though, as she thought that, Mijo found the source. The Biolab. But as soon as they opened the door... It wasnt the same biolab they left when they were... Alive? But, with nothing left to explore or find, they went in..

*Game has been started*

Immediately skeletons raise from the ground... They didnt look friendly. Both of them drew their swords and started fighting.. First, Mijo slashed through the skeletons, but found out that swords are really hard to wield, he eventually fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Urda with her insane reaction time managed to dodge and shoot all skeletons and stabbed one directly in the rib cage but due to inexperience she also fell to the ground.

Mijo who was very exhausted and tired said, "These skeletons... AHHHH why can't i fight them like i practiced to? I always stab myself more than them!"

Urda who was the same also said, "Yeah! Me too man... My aim is pretty garbage and the sword too.."

The skeletons approached, holding their swords... They had to think of something.

Mijo said, "From what i know, we usually don't have powers but since this is WAY different SO we should be able to do SOMETHING!"

Urda said, "I agree! Hmm..." 

Urda tried to harness whatever power she had, but she got hit in the stomach before she could do anything.

Mijo said, "Ah shit! Right, these stupid skeletons, OK I deal with them you get whatever you have... If it doesn't work uhhh I don't know?"

Urda got up and said, "Ok then.. Thanks for the sacrifice!"

Mijo scoffed but continued trying to defend against the skeletons which were many but he was able to kill a couple before he got pushed back.

Mijo said, "Are you heckin' ready or something???"

Urda said, "No... Of course not!"

Both of them looked desperate and sad. As the skeletons approached and slashed one last time against them suddenly, they felt power resonate in them... As soon as they felt it, first Mijo immediately began to rip through skeletons, bone by bone and second, Urda was able to stop time and throw a sword into a skeleton before shooting a bunch of skeletons multiple times before resuming time.

Mijo screamed, "DIE! DIE! YOU BONE HEADED CREATURES!!!" As he was slicing like a lightning bolt.

Urda said more calmly, "OK.... Fuck all of you skeletons!" before shooting and stopping time a lot.

The skeletons were outmatched in magic and so they all died, piece by piece. Eventually the battlefield cleared and both were left with bones and more bones.

Mijo and Urda were breathing very heavily and were super duper tired...

Mijo said, "Hahaha... We won! Against skeletons... Honestly.. kinda thought we would just die.."

Urda responded, 'Yeah, didn't know we had powers!"

Mijo said, "Well we do now, i guess..."

Urda said, "Finally, i can fulfill my dreams of becoming like... Kahazu! or close enough?"

Mijo questioned, "Who is Kahazu? I vaguely remember who that is-"

Urda answered, "Oh right, di ka nga pala naglalaro ng shingen-"

Mijo said, "I do! I just haven't gotten to that part yet..."

Urda said, "Yeah, sure, like what at least a day of playing-

Mijo said, "WHAT?!? Bro.... I'm still in Monshtat..."

Urda laughed and said, "That must mean you have only started playing... Sige na nga, tutulungan na nga kita, when we get out of here of course."

Mijo said, "Sure then, lets go!"

So they pressed on towards the dark fountain that was in front of them, reaching a _familiar_ star...

Urda shouted, "Wait! Mijo!"

Mijo responded, "Wha- Ohh."

A _familiar_ star twinkled.

Mijo said, "Well, when a star appears in front of us, that means, its a save point... Which means, WE LIVE IN A VIDEOGAME?!!?"

Urda said, 'Wait Mijo, it could just be a feature of the world, i mean... I guess it could be but does it matter?"

Mijo said, "Good point, i was just jokin though, lets save!"

Urda said, "Sige!"

So they saved their progress and after that, they encountered enemies that with their full power are easy to win against such as big butterflies, ladybugs, and frogs. Eventually though they made it to Cab Castle. Where they met the Skeleton king...

King said, "Ah yes, the heroes, the 2 humans and... where are they???

Jomi responded, "What do you mean? There's only two of us..."

Urda also responded, "Yeah, kailangan ba namin ng mas marami pang... tao?

King said, "Well at least three, but it doesn't matter, ya'll lose anyway! Prepare to die!"

Then King suddenly summoned the elite skeleton guard to kill the lightners, but then suddenly a blast of white lightning slashes through the bones wiping most of the guards.

Mijo said, "Woah! What was that?"

Urda said, "Ang cool!!!"

The hooded figure said, "You're lookin' for me?"

King said, "You! Of course you would start like that! No matter! I will kill you myself!"

Then, a bunch of skeletons and lab beakers broke through the gate, and were about to surround the three heroes.

Mijo said, "Yooo?? Where did they come from???"

Urda said, "You know malakas tayo diba?"

Mijo said, "Ay, oo nga!"

The hooded figure said, "Yeah, no, trust me, you are NOT surviving if you don't get my help."

Urda said, "Oh really, meron akong time travel!"

Mijo said, "Uh yeah, what she said, also like didn't you like well, destroy the skeleton guards?"

The hooded figure said, "Well, they were surprised and i'm stronger."

Urda ignored them and started to do her thing but then she felt weaker and weaker as she teleports around. Mijo tried to do the same too, by ninja dashing all of the enemies but by the end he felt the same.

The hooded figure said, "Welp, guess i was right..

Mijo and Urda, both breathing very heavily and said, "Shut up..."

The hooded figure said, "Well, I will deal with these troops that are still fighting and uh you guys deal with the king ok? Ok."

Mijo said, "Ah, fine."  Then he whispered to Urda and said, "Uh i don't trust this person, do you?"

Urda whispered back, "Yeah, I don't, but we have no choice.."

Mijo then said to the hooded figure, "Yeah.. Sure!"

The hooded figure nodded then went to the skeleton army to kill them as Mijo and Urda thought of a way to kill the Skeleton King.

King said, "Oh finally, your conversation's over! I can kill you now!"

Urda said, "Wait you could? THE ENTIRE TIME???"

King said, "Of course, it wouldn't be fair now wouldn't it? I wouldn't wanna kill everyone here and that's it, i wanna enjoy the experience. Oh you all are already stabbing me..."

Mijo said, "Yeah no, we don't wait, unlike you!" as he stabbed the king.

King said, "Alright, that's it!" and fought back, by pushing both out of sword range.

Mijo quickly ran to the Skeleton King, and dueled the king as Urda shot the king and tried to run to the King's back before getting stopped by some of the skeletons.

Urda shouted, "Oof! Skeleton's here!"

The hooded figure then quickly went to Urda's position and fought the skeletons as Urda now finally has the opportunity to backstab the king. So she did. Then the king fell to the ground, defeated.

Urda said, "I guess that's it?"

Mijo said, "Let's ask the hooded figure, hey! hood guy!"

The hooded figure then went to Mijo and Urda, and said, "What?"

Mijo said, "Are we done? Can we go now?"

The hooded figure said, "Yeah. Oh! just in case you need me, my name's Jomi."

Mijo said, "Alright Jomi, uhhh-"

Urda interrupted and said, "Where's the fountain?"

Jomi said, "There! Behind that huge door, near the throne."

Urda said, "Ay, salamat po!"

Mijo said, "Wait how do we close 'em, the fountains, i mean."

Jomi said, "Just like.. believe in yourself to get your heart out to the fountain, metaphorically."

Mijo said, "That... Doesn't help but whatever.."

Jomi said, "I swear that's how it works!"

Urda said, "Well Mijo, alam mo ba kung paano gumagana ang fountain?

Mijo said, "No? I'm just saying it's dumb."

Jomi said, "You all should probably go, don't you all have like entire days to experience?"

Mijo said, "Yeah, yeah..."

Then Mijo saw a smaller door to the right of the throne.

Mijo said, "Hey! Jomi! You know what's behind... That door?" pointing to the smaller door.

Jomi said, "That is where scopicro is imprisoned, a strange figure..."

Urda said, "Well? Patayin natin siya, Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Let's just see what they look like."

So Mijo and Urda went to the smaller door, opened it then went down the stairs, until a huge prison is revealed with a microscope-looking figure.

Mijo said, "Well, guess you're..."

Urda interrupted, "Scopicro!"

Scopicro then looked at them, walked straight towards them and said, "Well, well, well, here are the 'heroes', hmm? You don't have the key? How unfortunate. I wanted to test skills, and more! But i guess i'll have to stay still and be observing."

Mijo said, "So Urda, uhh you wanna go back and like get the keys for this guy?"

Urda said, "Nahh, lets go, gusto ko na matulog!"

Mijo said, "Well, whatever your deal is, its off."

Scopicro said, "As you wish, after all, lightners are our 'saviours'. Wouldn't wanna disobey them.."

As Mijo and Urda went up, they discussed Scopicro.

Mijo said, "Well i guess we are considered saviours i guess, even though we barely won against the skeleton king."

Urda said, "That's so cool! I wonder why? Maybe Jomi knows about it?"

Mijo said, "You wanna get home right?"

Urda said, "Yeah, but interesado ako."

Mijo said, "Sure.. but lets just go home."

Urda said, "Fiine.."

So Mijo and Urda went out of the basement door, and went behind the throne, opened the huge door, and saw the fountain.

Mijo said, "A'ight, andito na tayo."

They walked closer and closer to the fountain until they were just a few meters away.

Mijo said, "Wait! Who's closing the fountain?"

Urda said, "Uhhh, you! Duh."

Mijo said, "Of course..."

*Game End*

So Mijo closed the fountain by materializing his heart out of magic then raising it to the fountain. Music played as light took over the vision of the two. Then they woke up in the biolab. Almost like they were just dreaming? Both of them woke up.

Mijo looked around and saw Urda and said, "Yo, uh, you still here like after 12?"

Urda responded, "Yeah.. umm.. wait, what's the time?"

Both checked their phones and it was 5 PM...

Both said, "WHAT?!?!?" and quickly got their things and went outside the biolab.

Mijo said, "Uhh hey, this was locked..."

Urda said, "Well, hindi na ngayon."

Mijo said, "Lets close the door... Bye Skelly!"

Urda also said, "Bye Boner!"

Mijo said, "Dude, they're called skelly. Cause skeleton?"

Urda said, "No, they're called boner, mas maganda yung pangalan niyon!"

Mijo said, "Oof, whatever, our parents must be worried for us."

Urda said, "Oh yeah. I gotta go, bye!"

Mijo said, "Yeah, see you next week!"

Both waved their goodbyes, Mijo went home.

Mijo went home, and realized that, the "12 uwian" message didn't get sent so he was fine.
His parents only figured it out after they went home and talked to Mijo. Mijo was surprised and so for the first time sent a message to Urda.

Mijo: Yo, were you bothered by your parents about the whole 12 yung uwian?

Urda: NO uh not really i was about to message them then uhhhhh i fell asleep????

Mijo: did they get like a message about it like in the parents gc?

Urda: nahh they don't check that which is awfully convenient!!! 

Mijo: well thats good i guess. 

Urda: 👍

So Mijo decided to sleep, it was probably nothing anyway.

Notes: WOOOOO DONE AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF!!!!!! Seriously... Like i have yet to complete the other ones so good luck to me!  Goodbye! See ya next time!

<md-block>
    Summary: Chess Game in school and shenanigans happen. Friends missing and searches...

    Author Notes: A friend helped me with this and uh yeah just wanted to play chess and decided this is a great chance to write something. So i hope you enjoy it! BTW might not be inline with the canon this was based on as i write this i havent finished the last one but yeah!
    
    Mijo steps into the school, and begins walking to class and after opening the door and taking a seat:
    
    JR said, "Hello Mijo!"
    
    Mijo said, "Hi! Uh so what you doin' "
    
    JR said, "Reviewing for AP quiz later... Have you reviewed?"
    
    Mijo said, "No... I am right now!"
    
    JR said, "Ok..."
    
    Then JR talked to someone else and Mijo decided to sit and review until Urda showed up and got Mijo's attention.
    
    Urda spoke up, "Hey... Mijo, So meron akong sasabihin sayo na dapat tayo lang may alam..."
    
    Mijo said, "Ok... Hmmm what's it?"
    
    Urda said, "So, meron ka bang nakaranas na dark world?"
    
    Mijo said, "Uhh, yes???? You did too? I thought panaginip lang 'yon!"
    
    Urda said, "Yun din isip ko, pero it was too real at di ko pa nakakalimutan eh..."
    
    Mijo said, "Well, ano na gagawin natin?"
    
    Urda said, "Well, kung magkapareho ang pagbukas sa runedelta sa dito.. Pwede natin gawin ngayon?"
    
    Mijo said, "Hmm, gusto mo?"
    
    Urda said, "Oo naman, na-obsess nako don, meron nga kong drawing at iba pa, diba ikaw din?"
    
    Mijo said, "Oo, ako din-"
    
    Then, Jamise interrupted: "Hey! So ayaw ko interrupt yung bonding time niyo, pero pinapapunta na tayo sa gym..."
    
    Mijo and Urda both stared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After following Jamise, and heading outside of the class, into the gym but then suddenly darkness spews out of the door near the chemistry lab that was near the pathway to the gym and at first all of them were surprised but then Urda and Mijo quickly ran towards it and jumped into the chemistry lab and as Jamise was chasing them: "Hey! Wait!!!".
    
    But as Jamise stared into the abyss, she decided to jump in as her friends were there and the flag raising ceremony was gonna be boring anyway and so she decided to jump and fall.
    
    *darker, yet darker*
    
    As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'
    
    JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."
    
    Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."
    
    JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."
    
    Mijo and Urda both fell at the same time but as soon as they landed, they saw that they were in some kind of black and white board and looked around to see: Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn! It was chess!!! But instead it was too big and so they had to make a choice: white or black?
    
    Mijo spoke up, "Yo uhh what color should we choose?"
    
    Urda said, "Uhhhhh, Di ako naglalaro ng chess?"
    
    Mijo said, "White it is then!"
    
    So they took the white pieces and started the game. They vaguely saw a person with black jacket, long hair and a staff playing the black pieces.
    
    Urda said, "So, since di ako naglalaro ng chess, dito lang ako, manonood."
    
    Mijo said, "Ok then, watch and learn!"
    
    *Meanwhile, in the light world...*
    
    JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."
    
    *Back to the Dark World!*
    
    So the game started, white moves pawn to e4, black moves to e5, knight moves to f3, knight moves to c6, bishop to c4, knight to g5, pawn to h6, queen to h5, queen takes knight g5, queen takes pawn f7, king moves to d8 and queen takes bishop g8, checkmate!
    
    "Thats... Checkmate! Why was that so easy, i mean... Who else trolls like that?", said Mijo.
    
    "Probably Jamise, but i can't prove it!", said Urda.
    
    "What? But-" said Mijo before getting cut off by that person playing black suddenly running towards them.
    
    Mijo and Urda both readied up their defensive stances and watched as the figure eventually was visible enough to be... Wait.. isn't that Jamise?
    
    Mijo and Urda calmed down, and talked to Jamise.
    
    Jamise first spoke, "Hey? What was that for?"
    
    Mijo responded, "Bruhhh, we thought you were an enemy! Of course we had our weapons out... But for the chess game uhhh-"
    
    Jamise cut off Mijo, "I understand! But.. Ano ang lugar na'to? Why are we dressed up like fantasy magical people?"
    
    Urda spoke up, "Basically, Jamise, parang alternate world na may cool monsters, powers at mga lugar na pwede i-explore!"
    
    Mijo then responded, "Yeah, what she said.. We should head out... Malalate tayo!"
    
    So they went out of the chess room and into the unknown...
    
    *At the Light World...*
    
    Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...
    
    Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"
    
    Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"
    
    JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"
    
    *Lauvielle joined the conversation!*
    
    Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"
    
    Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"
    
    As the lighteners were going around in the dark, looking at the endless piles of scientist gear...
    
    Jamise spoke up, "Soo like pano ba maglaban? You guys seem prepared?"
    
    Urda first said, "Basically, Jamise, parang meron magpapakitang mga kalaban... At pag nagkaroon ng musika, pwede mo na sila patayin! At umm??"
    
    Jamise spoke again, "Mhmm.. at??? Ano!?!!"
    
    Urda said again, "Magkakaroon ka ng mga powers.. diko alam kung paano, di din alam ni Mijo eh.."
    
    Jamise said, "Ah! Kaya pala staff lang ang meron sakin haha... Paano gamitin?"
    
    Urda thought as she spoke, "Uhhhhhh????"
    
    Mijo said, "I think it's believing in yourself? At least that's what the sign said last time..."
    
    Urda said, "O-Oh yeah!! Yuon!! Nakalimutan ko..."
    
    *Light shines through!*
    
    As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason.
    
    They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...
    
    Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."
    
    Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"
    
    JR and Rhida nod in agreement.
    
    Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."
    
    As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...
    
    JR said, "Ok... Perfecto! Baka Nandito sila, papasok ako.." and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.
    
    Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"
    
    But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.
    
    Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."
    
    Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"
    
    Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"
    
    Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."
    
    So they threw the bags into the dark. Mijo's, Urda's, Jamise's and JR's were the bags that they decided to throw to the chemlab.
    
    *Back into the Darkness.*
    
    Jamise said, "But Urda! I don't believe in myself! I need to know EXACTLY how!!"
    
    Urda said, "Well, nakuha ko yon noong mapapatay ako ng mga skeletons doon, so... Pwede kaya yon?
    
    Jamise said, "THANK YOU!!!"
    
    Then they heard someone fall and hit the ground...
    
    Mijo said, "Sino yon?? Let's draw our weapons..."
    
    Jamise said, "Bakit pala lagi kayo nakaready? Di naman siguro laging may nagtinig meron kalaban?"
    
    Urda said, "Necessary kasi... Last time di kami ganito, na-ambush kami..."
    
    Jamise said, "Oh! ok..."
    
    A doctor-like person appears out of the darkness, with a staff that looks like it has a snake wrapped around it on the right hand. On the left hand, it looks like they had a kitchen knife. They immediately blast dark energy.
    
    Urda and Mijo both quickly ran away from the blast as Jamise tried to deflect the blast with her staff before getting blasted back to the pair.
    
    Mijo quickly ran to the enemy only to realize that the doctor was JR, and that he almost stabbed him.
    
    Mijo shouted, "Wait! Wait! Aren't you JR?"
    
    JR responded, "Yes... Wait are you... Damn it."
    
    Mijo said, "Yeah I'm Mijo, that's Urda and that's Jamise."
    
    JR said, "Oh, nice."
    
    Jamise then ran up to JR and said, "Hey! You just blasted me with... Dark energy!"
    
    JR apologized and said, "Yeah, uh i didn't notice you as Jamise! Sorry!"
    
    JR whispered to Mijo, "Maybe."
    
    Urda then caught up with Jamise and said, "Oh! Hello JR!"
    
    JR said, "Hi!"
    
    All of them grouped up and decided to walk to the door in front of them.
    
    *Back to the Light*
    
    "And that should be all the questionnares, alright class, it looks like it's breaktime, so have your break!" said Mam Maris, the AP teacher.
    
    "Goodbye Mam Maris!" said the class before the teacher left.
    
    Lauvielle went to Leviente and said, "Uh hey, you wanna... talk about... JR and the others?"
    
    Leviente responded, "Sure. What exactly about them?"
    
    Lauvielle said, "Well, yung madilim na chemlab?"
    
    Leviente responded, "Well, i'm not sure what happened there, we can only assume that- patay na si JR."
    
    Lauvielle got annoyed but continued and said, "Well pwede 'yon o di pa sila patay, pwede naman din yon!"
    
    Leviente said, "That can also be the case, pero di natin talaga maalam kung di tayo pupunta don ulit."
    
    Lauvielle responded, "Well, I guess... Iintayin nalang ba natin hanggang 5? Kung ano ang nangyayari doon, siguro naman, di maganda?"
    
    Leviente said, "Oh yeah, yung malaking butas sa baba ng chemlab..."
    
    Lauvielle then saw that Rhida was going inside the room and so Lauvielle dragged her to the conversation.
    
    Rhida questioned, "What, why did you bring me here? Lauvielle?"
    
    Lauvielle answered, "We are talking about the dark chemlab. Now do you have any insights to what we're talking about?"
    
    Rhida said, "Well, i guess about THAT, we are out of options here, and uhh, titignan nalang natin kung ano yung mangyayari."
    
    Lauvielle and Leviente both nodded and Rhida went back with her other friends as Lauvielle and Leviente talked about something else.
    
    *Darkness awaits*
    
    Mijo opened the door as the rest followed behind him, the place was filled with chemistry, beakers, flasks, tubes, goggles and more. They fought the heroes but they lost. The heroes were just too many with their knife, swords, and staffs. But as they fought and spared through enemies, Jamise was standing by the side though, as Mijo, Urda and the still-learning JR to deal with the enemies, though she was the one asking the group to not kill everyone.
    
    Jamise talked to Mijo, "Yeah no, i don't get it, how do you do it??? JR has nice magical powers but... he didn't go through like a life and death situation?"
    
    Mijo responded, "Well I don't know either but i know a person, they're named Jomi and they have a black hood. That's it. They probably know something about it"
    
    Jamise questioned, "Asan siya then? Like meron bang shop, or like somewhere where nakikita niyo siya?"
    
    Urda jumped into the conversation after listening in for quite a while, saying, "Well, nakita namin siya noong final battle against... A skeleton king!"
    
    Jamise responded, "Whaat, sis, magagamit ko yung powers ko, kung meron ako, sa last battle??? Hays..."
    
    Mijo then went to JR and said, "Hey! I have been meaning to ask, how did you get your powers? Like did you spawn with it or you got it?"
    
    JR said, "Got it." then showed the knife to Mijo and said, "I was fighting some chess figures, and i had to use my knife, but after almost losing to a queen attack, i used a staff that i had out of nowhere and you know the rest."
    
    Mijo responded, "So like, you killed all the chess figures and then you met us?"
    
    JR said, "Yup."
    
    Mijo responded, "A'ight, that's nice."
    
    Mijo then went back to Urda and Jamise chatting.
    
    Jamise said, "How is the magic defined anyway, like what you dream of something?"
    
    Urda said, "Uhh, your essence? Your very soul?
    
    Mijo said, "Hey! Uh like JR got his own do-or-die situation.. I guess you can try fighting?"
    
    Jamise said, "But Mijo??? I only have a staff, you guys have like guns, swords, knifes, but I have a stupid staff that doesn't do anything until i get magic."
    
    Urda turned to Mijo and said, "Mijo, paano ba pala like yung pagpapagaling sa mundo nito? Besides the save points?"
    
    Mijo said, "Well, I don't really know, until someone reveals their healing powers... Wait!"
    
    Mijo then goes to JR and says, "Hey, uh since you're a... cardiologist? Do you have healing powers?"
    
    JR responded, "Well, i haven't tried healing anyone yet... What? Like is someone damaged?"
    
    Mijo answered, "Well, Jamise, but like what if someone gets hurt while in a fight, we have to get to the nearest save point which is usually a while after a lot of fights?"
    
    JR responded, "I see.."
    
    Jamise said to all of the group, "Hey guys uh we have been talking for minutes now, where's the bad guys?"
    
    Then test tubes attacked the group, so they fought, Jamise decided to attack them with her staff and failed but JR after harnessing the power of a cardiologist managed to heal Jamise begrudgingly and she was fine.
    
    Jamise said, "Oh wow, salamat JR!"
    
    JR said, "Yeah, don't die."
    
    The test tubes got beaten by Mijo and Urda by breaking their fragile glass defense, as Jamise and JR were talking.
    
    Jamise then rushed to Mijo and said, "Hindi gumana yon! I just got injured!"
    
    Mijo said, "Look, uhhh-" Mijo thought about it more before saying, "I don't know sis, uh i guess we'll have to wait and see???"
    
    Jamise annoyed, said "OK. But if we get into a fight, AKO na lalaban ok?"
    
    Mijo said, "Alright, alright, i'll tell the others... Let's see what happens."
    
    Mijo says to everyone else, "Hey everyone, let Jamise fight ok?"
    
    Urda said, "Sure. Mas konting gagawin ko lol!"
    
    JR said, "Ok. I'll watch."
    
    So they moved on, fighting their way through enemies such as until they saw a checkpoint.
    
    Mijo said, "Look everyone! A save point!"
    
    JR questioned, "How do you 'save'?"
    
    Mijo said, "Touch it and like a menu pops up right, like on top of it, press that save bn and you're done!"
    
    Urda said, "Yo, and there's like items in the menu and you get to see stats like health, magic type-"
    
    Mijo whispered to Urda, "Isn't that runedelta menus? Also that doesn't even appear there?"
    
    Urda laughed and said to Mijo, "Of course not! Are you hallucinating anything?"
    
    Mijo responded, "No-" then turned to JR and said, "Look it's simple-"
    
    JR said, "No, it- its fine, Mijo, I already saved. It's as simple as you said."
    
    Mijo said, "Ok then... Let's move on."
    
    So they moved on to the next area, where there were a bunch of enemies, and the area looked like a garden but had many scraps of metal and wood, it seems that it was being used to create the building next to it, though it was incomplete. As they fight through, Jamise strikes up a conversation.
    
    Jamise said, "Hey, these skeletons and beakers are so easy, where's the real deal? Like bosses or something??"
    
    Mijo said, "Well, i don't really know, it depends what we do and how big the world is but yeah, not much i can say right now..."
    
    JR said, "Hey guys! This place looks like our school garden, andito yung honrato statue!" pointing to the statue of honrato near a circle of plants and bushes.
    
    Urda said, "Well, i guess we're near something important i think?"
    
    Then suddenly the statue grew and molded to a humanoid being, out of honrato's statue. It can control little atom-like rocks and has a beaker as its main weapon. It decided to fight the group.
    
    Mijo shouted, "Yooo, why are we getting attacked by honrato?"
    
    JR responded, "Baka nangyari ito sa maraming oras na di ko siya binigyan ng 5 pesos!"
    
    Jamise then quickly pushed the others and shouted, "Guys! Kaya 'ko 'to!"
    
    Then she failed to dodge the atoms but managed to deflect the beaker, and finally blast the beaker using her newly found powers.
    
    Jamise said, "Wooo! Lets goooo!"
    
    Then she got pummeled by the atoms so she had to retreat. The others stepped up and fought the statue.
    
    Jamise shouted from the back, "Guys! Nakita niyo yon!!! Ang cool!!!!"
    
    JR responded, "Yeah, yeah, just keep blasting him ok?"
    
    *TO THE LIGHT*
    
    All of the class said, "Good Afternoon! Mam Arcea!"
    
    Mam Arcea said, "Ok class, lets pray!"
    
    So a random student went to the front and prayed and then the students were allowed to sit down.
    
    Mam Arcea said, "Ok attendance! Hmm.. Asan si Cara, Aman, Rira at si Baltsar?"
    
    Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"
    
    Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... Sige-" and after that class continued...
    
    Fexili whispered to Rhida, "Asan si Balts? kala ko andito siya noong lunch?"
    
    Rhida whispered back, "Ah, umalis after ng... lunch siya kasi... sumakit daw ang ulo niya"
    
    Fexili whispered, "Ohhhh, ok..."
    
    *Darkness.*
    
    Eventually, the statue was blasted

Author Notes: A friend helped me with this one

Summary: 

# section done
As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

*1 hour later*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*1 more hour later*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

Lauvielle joined the conversation!

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason. 

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"

JR and Rhida nod in agreement.

Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."

As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

JR said, "Ok... Perfecto!" and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.

Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"

But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.

Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."

Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

They went back to their classroom and soon enough, rumors started spreading that the chemistry lab was so dark, that not even light from outside could illuminate it and it even spread darkness but only then only a select small people specifically from 8-Clam confidently know but it got around to the teacher, she checked the cctv and found nothing, like literally just black from the hallway and the chemistry lab. Weird, guess the cctv is broken..

Lunch came and they decided to sneakily take Urda, Mijo and Jamise's bags to the Chemistry Lab where they threw it hopeful that they are there along with JR but they weren't sure and even if, it was the only spot that could hide something so they threw it there and left it until later.

Mam Arcea said, "Asan si Cara, Aman at si Rira?"

Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"

Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... So-" and after that class continued...

Summary: School is a burden on these hopeful lightners to save the world... It would take an exam to stop them right in their tracks...

Author's Note: Basically all of my anxiety, frustration and stress from my school exams into this story.

After another dark world has been sealed in the computer lab, they decided to leave. As chances of anyone seeing them there were high and they didn't want to get sent to the principal or guidance office. So Mijo, Urda, and JR exited out to find Rhida, Leviente and Lauvielle talking at the tables near the computer lab.

Rhida said, "There's an exam!? But, we literally have the worlds to explore!"

Leviente said, "Exams... The NAT, E. Math and English, ICT, Math, AP, and others.. Also periodical exam next week."

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, lahat ngayon ay nakakabaliw sa isang tao!"

Rhida saw the other group and said, "O-Oh! Hello Balts!!!"

JR responded, "Hi Rhida! So-"

Leviente quickly said, "Yo, we should head back... 12:50 PM na!"

So they all rushed towards the classroom and opened the door to find their bags and the lights out. As they head for their bags and pack up,

Mijo said, "Uh, I can't believe we didn't contribute towards cleaning this classroom! Though the Garbage is still here.." as he sees two ziplocks filled with garbage.

JR said, "We'll just have to take it then, you Mijo, take one as well."

Mijo said, "Ok, ok..."

But as Rhida was about to leave, Mijo quickly approached her and convinced her to stay for one last announcement.

Mijo announced, "Uh, Urda!, JR, Leviente, Lauvielle and Rhida. Anyone here agrees to keep the dark worlds a secret- raise your hands if you agree."

All of them raised their hands. 

Mijo then said, "Good to know. Alright y'all can leave no-"

As he says that, Rhida and Urda rush out of the door being super late to their schedule. Eventually, Leviente and Lauvielle also leave and after that it's just JR and Mijo.

Mijo said, "Hopefully, nothing bad happens tomorrow and on friday, I don't really wanna deal with exams and saving the world..."

JR laughed and said, "Yeah..."

They left and closed the classroom as they left the school to go to their home, though their parents were not that happy. They understood that both of their lies that "Cleaning is hard you know?".

The next day rolls in, not much interesting happened as quizzes and pts were being done. But Mijo at lunch decided to look around for the next dark world but couldn't, thankful for this, he went back and studied and chatted along with the other students.

But something was brewing... *Darkness* will soon appear once again..

As ESP started, Mijo was just chillin' but as the NAT quickly arrived, his friends including but not limited to Urda, Leviente and Rhida went to the Computer Laboratory to begin their test.

Things were "fine" for the rest of the class as they waited patiently by reviewing many many notes but then Mijo began to think about the dark world again... He thought to himself that he should do this later, at home and night. Due to the exam LATER for him so he continued to review, hopefully distracting from the whole dark world stuff.

ICT came and he did the portfolio, it was tedious and boring but hey he did procrastinate last night to do the title soo yeah! (It was a cool drawing). After that, Mijo checked the clock and it was 2:33 PM. Near when they were going to the computer lab. It was time to study again and so he did. 

*Darkness spreads*

It was time to go. He and the others went to the comp lab and were told to sit at the nearby chairs and tables and they were 'reviewing' but not really as they weren't allowed to bring notes or phones so they just sat there and talked about random stuff until the roll call started..

Sir Joriec announced, "Ok, its time to roll call everyone here soo..." As he looks for the first name, "Caboc! Stand here.... Cala! Stand next to him!" 

Mijo had Cala as his last name so he went behind Caboc and the roll call continued until all were in a line and weren't blocking the pathway. 

Sir Joriec asked, "Hmmm, where is Rich, Delo Cuz, and.."

Sir Calas said, "Oh! They just arrived!" Pointing behind Sir Joriec. 

Sir Joriec said, "Ok... Rich! Stand there!" And the roll call continued

They waited as the first batch was finishing and getting out of the computer lab and getting their things. Urda was the first one and got out as soon as possible but then, Rhida, Mack, Leviente and JR burst out of the door and were talking though Mijo could barely hear them.

Rhida said, "How did you guys do??"

Mack said, "Very bad po!! Papunta na po ako sa Summer Class!"

All of them laughed.

Leviente said, "Ganon lang talaga pre-"

Rhida said, "Hey! Papasa ka kaya..."

Leviente said, "Ikaw din!"

JR was silent and was the first one to go to the classroom along with the others. 

Back to Mijo, he was slowly panicking and after they were allowed to go in, he sat down and started to log in. Some people were having problems for some reason but after 2 got kicked because they had no account, the test was started with a questionnaire.

*The day nears its end*

The questionnaire was kinda easy, honesty is the best policy they said, so he just answered mostly truthfully including the part where he would go to summer class which he answered no to.

*A test of knowledge and power*

After that, there was the English quiz which was kinda easy, but then Science's kinda hard and Math was especially very hard for Mijo but as there was dead air in-between he started thinking about the dark worlds but he decided to stay focused. 

*Soon, it will all end...*

After the quiz was over, he left seeing Vink and JR doing something in the computer lab. But he ignored it and instead quickly went to the classroom to grab his things. There he saw Leviente, Lauvielle, and Macu cleaning up.

Leviente said, "Lets go! Bilisan mo!"

Lauvielle said, "Wait lang kasi Leviente!!"

Leviente then saw Mijo and said, "Nakikita mo ba 'to Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah, also ano nangyari noong wala ako?"

Leviente said, "Uhh tignan natin, Wala kaming ginawa noong English... Nagquiz yung iba sa Math... Nag-chikahan lang kami tungkol sa Farewell Party... At si Urda lang ang naglinis noong time na!"

Then JR arrived and complained, "Bilisan niyo!!! Nagagalit na ang papa ko!"

Then CJ came in and started annoying Lauvielle.

CJ said, "B'at nandito ka Lola?"

Lauvielle responded, "Kasi CLEANERS ako!!!"

Though, they quickly cleaned up and started to leave. Almost locking Lauvielle but she left and so the door was closed yet again... By JR and all of them left.

After that, Mijo came home and slept like a sloth, and was up late doing tasks and thinking about the dark world...

Mijo said, "Today will be another day..."

DONE WOOOOOO

<!--Chapter 4 Part 2-->
## C4p2 DeltaRambles: School Reality

Summary: Another Boring Day.... Friends say goodbye though...

Author Note's: Continued my addiction to this story. Hope i finish it! 

As the Panicked Mijo quickly goes out of his house and into the tricycle, he wonders if he had any missing... 

Mijo said "Oh! Math! The Brochure... I AM SCREWED if mam Maris arrives orr mam CK arrives early... Ok as soon as i arrive i will do it.."

So Mijo rushed to school, almost late again, rushed to the classroom, sat down and begins the rushed project. He sees his friend JR doing something with Fexili on the computer, Leviente and Lauvielle reviewing with each other, Urda writing some notes... 

Mijo muttered to himself, "Ok then, let's do this!"

So he rushed it, lucky for him, Mam Maris didn't come and he finished the basic outline and started designing, he got some impressions from JR but he kept going until Mam CK arrived...

Clameans greeted the teacher, "Good Morning! Mam CK!"

So after she arrived, Mijo quickly rushed the last logo and passed it before the review and the quiz. 

*1 hour later...*

After a science quiz that was noticeably easy, Mijo stood up, walked around with JR and went to Urda who was busy with the Science Quiz.

Mijo said, "Hah.. You checked your paper, yet di ka pa tapos!"

Then as he was about to leave, he was approached by Urda.

Urda said, "Hey! Ikaw nga magpasa nito.." pointing to her quiz paper.

Mijo said, "Ikaw kaya!"

Urda said, "No, ikaw! I'll.. just follow you!"

Mijo said, "Ok, ok! Fine, let's go!"

So they rushed towards the door but before that,

Mijo asked JR, "Papunta ba si Mam Dansie sa Faculty?"

JR replied, "Yeah."

So they got out of the classroom, ran out towards the faculty room, opened the door and asked,

Mijo asked, "Asan po ba si Mam Dansie?"

A random teacher replied, "Nagkaklase po!"

So Mijo closed the faculty door and saw Mam Dansie going towards them. So they ran towards her and Urda very awkwardly gave Mam Dansie the quiz before heading back to the classroom.

Mijo, after interacting with his friends, JR, Leviente and Lauvielle, sat down in his chair and did his portfolio as JR moved seats on his own.

At lunch Mijo thought "After that, lunch! But it was a depressing lunch, I had to review a lot of quizzes and no friends to talk to.. yeah and the worst part? I also had to check my Computer Performance Task for issues which means wasting more time... Pretty uneventful for a world like this..." 

People were distracting themselves, actually reviewing, doing some performance tasks and others.. A day so boring you wonder how nothing interesting happens..

*A connection weakening...*

ICT quiz came along and there was a specific direction that screwed people's heads.. It said to write their crush and favorite teacher as Negative or Positive respectively. People all collectively lost their marbles and started making fun of it.. Some people were joking about putting their friends or were begging the teacher to let them put the initials, last and first name, Mijo put their own FULL name and the teacher's FULL name as well. It was fun..

As the English Teacher didn't arrive and people were just chillin' Mijo decided to walk and chill near the human model and researched about the dark world, how it forms based on games and how they formed earlier.

JR approached Mijo and randomly told him his parent's backstory, manners and other random facts.. The rest, Leviente was playing "AirRobin" a air defense using bow and arrow and Lauvielle was watching him, Urda was playing games with Yeasa, a game called "OTile Extreme" in which you press in sync with the music, Rhida was scrolling through Lemit, and the others were also just chillin'

Then when it was time to go home, everybody in the clasroom said their goodbyes to eachother and left, as next week will be a busy and stressful week as a lot of tasks were due and exams were present and the next next week will be pretty much a farewell party so it was a moment for all of them including Mijo.

*An interesting goodbye, i say...*

Mijo returned home and rest, for it was work tomorrow, and Sunday.

Mijo said, "This is gonna be A stressful week and I WILL be suffering but hey, it's gonna be worth it in the end..." Then he fell asleep...

DONE YOOOOOO

<p id="C5"><md-block># C5: School Break?</md-block></p>
<md-block>

Summary: Since its a review day... The 8-Pearleans are gonna review and finish their tasks right? RIGHT?!?

Author's Note: Super sleep deprived when making this one... 3 hour sleep before an exam is not good... Also I am wary of Mijo perspective being the most used but idk how to solve that? Also Taylor swift shenanigans in the future maybe? Also incomplete due to exams...

As Mijo woke up, sleep deprived, 6 AM... He remembered sleeping at 4... So he got up and started preparing for school..

He ran to the school and straight into the classroom, seeing Lauvielle and Skay on the way.

He entered the classroom, sat down at his chair and started to do his Science Portfolio but the FRC started and he headed out with JR.

Nothing interesting happened except that in the Student Government, Jamise didnt win P.I.O but  Klon did win Grade 9 Rep, so that was cool..

Mijo returned to the classroom and he did his science portfolio until he was done during filipino time in which:

He muttered to himself, "Wag kalimutan, pag mayrong nga taong nagmumukhang masaya, isipin mo ang taksil niya..." 

To a question Mam Payda had towards the students about a quote from Florante at Laura..

Before someone finally answered the question and he moved on. But another one! A bible question...

Mam Payda said, "Alam niyo ba yung storya kung saan meron ipinatapon na bata?"

Lauvielle responded, "Abraham po?"

Mam Payda said, "Hindi, yung may Mami na asawa?"

Then everyone collectively nodded, they knew it!

Mam Payda said, "Hmm hindi kasi yung may basket o yung pinatay lahat ng unang anak..."

After that, it was break time! So Mijo went out to go to the CR, little did he know what would happen...

As soon as he returned, he opened to see the dark world, yet again? It was weird, but not unlikely.. 

Mijo thought, "Still who would open here, was it one of the people who went with him in the dark worlds? If so, they couldn't know how to open it... Maybe the one that opens all the other portals? But I can't stand here... The only thing i can do now is..." Before he could second -guess himself he jumped in...

Things looked weird? Wasn't the same when he left...

Mijo looked around and said, "Wait! I see a city! Looks like our Biotech Lab Cabinets.. Imma go there..."

As he walked towards there, he saw large amonts of.. people. They were lightners! But if the entire class was here, then...

As he walked to the city, he saw a lot of people in different groups. First, there was Rhida and her friends, then Lauvielle and her friends with JR, then Urda and her friends and Leviente and his friends. 

Mijo then walked towards a big tower where there was a staircase, so he went up and up until he was up the tower and he saw a teen looking outwards of the tower. He walked up to that person and talked, 

"So, why are you here? All of the people are down under..."

The teen said, "Same thing i'd ask you."

Mijo said, "Well, who are you anyway? I don't recognize your face under that hood..."

The teen said, "Soon you will, but i have to ask you.. what are you doing up here?"

Mijo said, "I wanted to see what is up here... Who are you anyways?? I won't say anything until you show yourself. I dont trust anyone that isn't one of my friend's."

The teen said, "Well, if you must insist..." Then
they took off their hood to reveal a face so similar yet different...

"I am Jomi. A Princess of The Dark. I am without subjects but that doesn't matter... You lightners, i have been helping your journey secretly-"

Mijo cut off and said "So you were the one who killed those elite skeleton guards and the princess? Coool."

Jomi continued, "Yes. You must understand that a huge war will happen. You can stop it but it will take 3 light days."

Mijo questioned, "Light Days? You mean like 3 days sa aming mundo?"

Jomi responded, "Yes. I need you and your friends to prepare for it."

Mijo said, "Wait, this coincides with our exams... Ugh... Kinda wish this happens like 1 week after.."

Jomi said, "It is... Related."

Mijo said, "What??? How do YOU know that???"

Jomi said, "It is a test of your capabilities, intelligence and time management. The invaders will make the Dark World vanish. Never to be seen."

Mijo said, "Uhhh, what does that mean using simple words?"

Jomi said, "Basically, the exams are the invaders."

Mijo said, "Oh! I get it! So to pass the test, kailangan kong patayin ang mga dayuhan?"

Jomi said, "Yeah.."

Mijo said, "Saan ba mabubuksan ang portal sa dark world? Kung dati lang, andoon yon sa Yala-Dez room..."

Jomi said, "As far as i know, it could be anywhere, but it should be near your room."

Mijo said, "Teka lang! Are phones allowed here in the dark world?"

Jomi said, "Siguro, pero di mo magagamit ang internet."

Mijo said, "Ah, sige, pero paano ba ako makakabalik sa aming mundo? Nasaan ba yung fountain"?

Jomi said, "I can take you there. Though, i am curious, how would you explain to all of your classmates that a dark world just exists sa kanilang silid-aralan?"

Mijo said, "Either sasabihin na panaginip ang lahat nito o sabihin na wag magsumbong sa guro."

Jomi said, "Ok, ok, ok... Lets go."

So, they went below and below until they were at the floor of the tower.

Jomi said, "Don't you want to greet your friends first?"

Mijo said, "Nah, they are already busy with each other and also i just want to go home and rest for the big fight tomorrow..."

Jomi said, "I understand... Here." 

Jomi gives Mijo a book titled "Jomi's Guide to the Dark World".

Mijo said, "What am I supposed to be using this for? Alam ko na kung paano gumagana ang dark world eh..."

Jomi said, "It might not matter now, but it will matter later. Anyways, we should head here."

Mijo said, "Ok fine, i'll keep it, something to read i guess."

So they went behind the staircase and into the dark fountain.

Jomi said, "Here. You know what to do."

Mijo said, "Yeah, thanks! Also, what happens when i close this one? What happens to you?"

Jomi said, "When a dark world is opened, only a portal to it is opened, when closed, the dark and light worlds stay separate."

Mijo said, "Ok! Makes sense. Anyways imma go see ya when i see ya!"

Jomi said, "Goodbye!"

So Mijo closed the dark fountain and everything went back to normal, Mijo woke up sleeping in his seat, along with the others. At first, some were confused and then, the ones that knew it wasn't a dream turned and walked to Mijo.

Leviente first spoke, "Ah, Mijo! So paano ba natin mapapaliwanag ang lahat niyon?"

JR said, "Yeah. I DO NOT want the teachers finding out."

Rhida also said, "Ako din! Di ko alam kung paano ko masasabi sa friend group ko na lahat ng ginawa at pinag-usapan namin ay wala lang at ang pagkakatulad ng panaginip namin!! Diyos ko!"

Lauvielle added, "Yeah, yung sinabi ni Rhida at ang masasabi natin sa mga guro at sa cctv??"

Mijo finally responded, "Ok, teka lang, calm down nga muna kayo, as long as nobody tells the teachers, or even if one of us does, don't say a Qqsingle thing that can make it more believable... Just... Papunta mo nga si Jamise dito."

Rhida called Jamise and Jamise went to the group talk happening near Mijo's seat.

Mijo continued, "Can you announce WITH everybody here that the dark world indeed exists but no one should tell anybody else."

Jamise said "Ok, Mijo! Leviente, at Rhida, come on, follow me!"

Leviente and Rhida both sighed but followed Jamise's orders.

They, along with the other people who know that the dark world exists went at the front of the classroom.

Jamise announced, "8-Clam! Mayroon kaming announcement!! Rhida you go first."

Rhida said, "Ok guys, so totoo talaga na may dark world. "

Leviente said, "Yeah. Wag niyo lang sabihin sa mga guro."

Lauvielle said, "O kung hindi... Papatayin ko kayo!!!"

Mijo said, "Meron ba kayong mga tanong?"

Fexili questioned, "How? Kasi like, nasa cctv to' diba? At wala ba talagang guro na pumunta dito habang nangyayari yon?

Mijo said, "Di ko sure ehh. Pero kung merong nakakita, iisipin lang nila na panaginip yon kaya ok tayo don."

Fexili responded, "Sige, sige..."

Mijo said, "Meron pa ba? Kasi uwian na eh..."

Everyone said, "Wala na!". So they went snd started packing their bags and started to go home.

JR and Mijo were waiting in the doorway as the floor was being mopped. Leviente and Mack were waiting for the others to finish. 

Leviente said, "You know, isang taon na naglipas, at maghihiwalayan na..."

Mijo said, "Yep."

Leviente said, "Thank you for all of the memories, and hope i see you again!"

Lauvielle came up and said, "Sinasabi mo parang mamamatay si Mijo..."

Then they both left as the others were done and started to leave. Mack then closed the door after saying goodbye to the skeleton and left.

Soon JR and Mijo met up again, and said their goodbyes before returning home.

*Darkness soon will arrive....*

Mijo returned home and slept. After waking up around 12:00 AM, he reviewed and reviewed, because he had a reviewer. 

Mijo said, "Ok, so Jomi's Guide turned to MY reviewer on everything from quarter 1-4 grade 8??? But i don't do these things... It's good though so... Thanks Jomi!"

So he reviewed and reviewed. The next 3 days will be a huge battle, and he needs preparation right now.

DONE?

    <summary>CU DRAFT: The Last Supper</summary>
    <md-block>
        # CUD: The Last Supper
        Summary: After last week, our heroes want some rest and they get it, after a lot of planning and pain.

Author's Note: Wrote this at the school. I am gonna rewrite whole sections of this. So this is a draft worth keeping because i am inspired by this to make something else.

Mijo woke up and saw it was 7:00 AM. It was bad but since it was a school event today, no penalties for arriving late so he got up, ate, showered and gone to school.

Mijo arrived at the school at 7:45 AM, pretty late since the event started at 7:30 but he continued, he went to the classroom, no one was there, it makes sense, but there was no dark world... Yet. As they probably are at the gym.

So he put his bag and bananas at the table and went to the gym and sat down near JR and Yeasa. He greeted JR but he sat down and watched the gym, as singers sing, principals dance, and more principal remarks about the school year ending. Eventually the Principal got the Teachers at the front along with photographers to take a picture of the school year. The principal had the microphone and was directing the teachers but Mijo wasn't paying attention, he was just thinking to himself. But after the teachers were going back, the gym announced the teams that were gonna fight later.

"The Blu Grilies!!! Led by Pineda!"

"The White Pandas!!! Led by Crus!"

"The Yellow Scubas!!! Led by Boicno! "

"The Blak Horses!!! Led by Paroño!"

They took the oath of sportsmanship, and their league, the "DKB League 2!!!" was announced by the principal and they took a group photo. The opening was over and they all headed to their classrooms. A Mental Health Break.

Nothing important happened, they just started preparing for the presentation of the food at 10:30.

Mijo decided to open the dark world, for the first time. So he plunged his pencil to the ground and darkness spread throughout the classroom. Eventually falling to that same place once when he entered the classroom when it had a dark world. He got up and walked to the city again, this time, there were tables, chairs and a lot of food; hipon, banana and tilapia filled the tables.

JR greeted him, playing sudoku very hard. Mijo quickly went up the tower nearby and saw Jomi again.

"Hi! Uh you said that it was possible for any lightner to open dark worlds... Here we are! I opened it!" Mijo said.

"Ok... I suppose its fine for today, but you should go back, a game is playing." Jomi said.

"What do you me- Ohhh, right... But how do i get back without closing the portal?" Mijo questioned.

"Well, if you are the owner of the fountain, you can travel between the worlds without closing it. Just go into the fountain." Jomi said.

"How about my friends?" Mijo questioned again.

"You own the fountain, you control who gets in or out." Jomi said, "I know this because I have seen this before... on other lightners. Now go."

Mijo nodded and said goodbye to Jomi and went down to see Yeasa near the tower.

"Hey Mijo? Alam mo ba kung paano umalis dito? Last time kasi, sudden lang yung paglabas..." Yeasa said.

"I know! Just go through these stairs, and you see a fountain, just go straight through it. Easy lang, sundan mo lang ako." Mijo said.

"Ok??" Yeasa said before following Mijo through the stairs and near the fountain.

"Thank you!!" Yeasa said before going to the fountain and disappearing.

"I should go too, though since there's no inspection just yet... Close the fountain? Yeah... " Mijo said before closing the fountain.

Mijo woke up and saw jis classmates just chilling and still preparing as he just woke up on the floor. He can see Yeasa outside of the biolab going somewhere.

So he got up, went to Leviente.

Mijo said, "Wanna play chess?"

Leviente said, "Sure, just after this rubix cube is done." After Leviente completed the rubix cube, they played chess as other friends joined. 

After a while, they were called to bring some food to the classroom but as it turned out only one of them was needed so they all headed back with the food.

They continued playing chess until Leviente won with a Queen checkmate and Mijo was called again to get the tilapia and there they went back to the classroom with nothing. As the tilapia wasn't there until 11:00 AM. So Mijo went back and just sort of dozed off after the ESP Exam and Assignment were given back.

Then he was called again to get the tilapia and so he got that and went back to the classroom.
As other foods arrived, the table was starting to fill up with food and more food.

Eventually the teachers arrived and the class suprised them and they both waited for the judges. As they did, they took pictures, a lot of pictures. 

Then the class ate a lot of food and they chilled after that, Mijo goes to Urda, Yeasa and JR playing "Ganshun Pactim" on the tablet. They played a lot of games like "The Kat Empire" and "No Zombies". 

The teachers however cleaned the tables and called on the other students. Mijo passed his portfolio in TCI soon after. 

Then he got a chair and sat down near the table to sleep and he did for around until the championships in which JR woke him up, because the awardings would start. He slept again.

After a while, JR woke him up again due to the awardings which is starting now and they want all of them there. So he went along with his classmates, at first the line was confusing but then other sections also lined up so it was easy from there.

The awardings started. Boring. After that a lot of misdirection due to them suprising with a song break. But first, advice and inspiring speech. SONG BREAK TIME!!! 

After a while, it was time to go home, so 8-Clam went back to their classroom and Mijo was with them and after they arrived...

Mijo decided to finally open the dark world again.

At the same spot, he plunged his pencil to the ground and darkness once again rose and spread. All in the classroom fell to the darkness once more.

Mijo woke up again. This time on top of the tower, Jomi walked up to him and said, "You must get up, I have something to say." So she pulled him up and Mijo talked, "What do you want to say?"

Jomi said, "All of these adventures, don't you wanna rest, at this point? I can give you a restart."

Mijo said, "What? What do you mean?"

Jomi said, "This and your world will dissapear if you don't restart.. everything."

Mijo said, "Wha- What? Right now?!?"

Jomi said, "I noticed that everything has been collapsing, losing its grip in reality, becoming dark. Whoever created this world is losing their grip on it for reasons."

Mijo said, "Do you know? "

Suddenly the walls around the city disappeared into the dark. People below were confused and panicking.

Jomi said, "It looks like the walls are down. I might know why but you'll have to see for yourself. Now restart! Only lightners can!"

Mijo said, "Wha- ok then!"

So Mijo pressed restart and suddenly it went dark. Not dark world darkness, pure darkness. Mijo saw text being typed, narrating everything he's doing. 

I wrote, "Mijo, i am sorry for this but i must end this. For your and everyone sake."

Mijo said, "How? Will i keep memory of this?"

I answered, "No. Atleast where you're going. I will consider that though. Goodbye."

Mijo said, "Ok. I can see where this is going. Goodbye too."

*So the world was covered in darkness...*

Note: Done?

<!--Chapter after Dark world i think? Chapter 7 now. definitively.-->
<p id="C7"><md-block># C7: The Last Supper</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: Mijo and his friends, after going through a lot last week, decided to rest, eat and enjoy their school event, until someone interrupts.

Author's Notes: Rewrote an entire chapter in school. Missed out on like on the entire league games but its worth it! Also someone helped.

Also (yep...):

Chees - Chess

Sukodu - Sudoku

Mijo woke up and saw that he was almost certainly late. 

"Ah shit.. Go go go!!"

So he got out of bed and he prepeared to go to school. After eating, showering, and dressing up, he went out of his house and went to school. 

"Sana pareho lang sa dati..."

He was suprised that he wasn't checked for being late but he moved quickly to his classroom as an event was happening outside.

"Woah, really?!? Wow guess i'm wrong... Gotta keep movin' though."

So he opened the door and.. it was dark. Like dark world dark. 

"Whaat?!? Dark world already? But can't i not go out unless i close the fountain again? Well, i'm sure i wont miss anything... important anyway."

So he jumped in with his bananas to the dark world. He landed safely on like a red carpet with Jomi standing near, greeting him.

Jomi said, "Oh! Hi Mijo! You must be late! Its... almost 8! And the event is supposed to start at-"

Mijo said, "Yeah, yeah. No need to be reminding about it. Now uh.. how did they all get out of here? I dont see anyone, and i think i saw some of my friends at the gym?"

Jomi said, "Oh! Uh i have a new way of you guys going in and out of the dark world. Basically just go back there again if you want to go outside."

Mijo said, "Coool. Can you put this away for me? Thanks!!!" Before quickly dropping his bag and bananas and going back to the light world.

Jomi said, "Hey! Get back here! Damn it. I knew he would do that. Its easy to bring them anyway. I have magic." and so she just moved them to a place near the red carpet near a bunch of closets with magic.

Mijo then exited out of the dark world out to the outside of the classroom. He quickly joined the others in the gym and watched what was happening in the gym.

Principal said, "Welcome to your Last Dinner officially with your fellow students! I declare the DKB League open! Enjoy it! I want to also get Ms. Sopah to sing for us!"

Mijo said, "Yooo, meron magkakanta sa stage???"

*later..*

Mijo said again, "Yoo, sumsasayaw ang principal natin??"

JR said, "Yep."

*much later..*

Mijo said, "Yo, so these are the DKB Teams..."

JR said, "Yeah, i don't know why the teams specify the color when, halimbawa, black na nga yung raven eh..."

Both laughed.

*much much later*

Principal said, "With that, i dismiss you all to your own classrooms! Good luck to all!!!"

Mijo said, "Finally, the teacher group photo is over, so we can go back to our classroom now... "

JR said, "Mijo, lets go na!"

So they went back to the classroom, where one-by-one people jumped into the dark world. As people walked in, they all saw a huge castle with towers. JR was the first one so he got to meet Jomi for the first time.

Jomi said, "Hello! Welcome to My Castle Town... What's your name?"

JR said, "I don't know you.. How about you first??"

Jomi muttered to herself, "Damn it, i knew this hoodie wouldn't work..."

Jomi then said, "Well.." takes off her hoodie, and said, "I'm Jomi. The Princess of the Dark. You?"

JR said, "Ok? I'm JR... You look like Mijo.. Are you trying to imitate him- wait... Are you Mijo's twin?"

Jomi said, "Uhh?? No- Maybe? Look, just go inside the castle, ok? I'm like busy.."

JR said, "Sige, sige..." before walking inside the castle..

Then Mijo was next..

Jomi said, "Hi! Mijo.. this is a new castle i worked on last weekend so.. i hope you enjoy it!"

Mijo said, "Thanks! Asan pala yung bags namin?"

Jomi said, "It's.. inside. I moved it inside. You would see it."

Mijo said, "Ok, ok.. Goodbye! See you later!"

Jomi said, "Y- You too!"

Then a few more other students, then Lauvielle and Leviente appeared.

Jomi said, "He-"

Leviente cut off and said, "Yo, wait, kamukha ka ni Mijo! Weird... I thought Mijo would say if he clone himself..."

Jomi said, "Well-"

Lauvielle said, "Or, she just looks like him, ok? Everyone that looks like Mijo is not just cloning..."

Jomi said, "Yeah.. So hello, welcome to the dark world, this is my castle, i hope you enjoy it!"

Lauvielle said, "Tara na, Leviente!"

So they went to the castle. Other student followed until Urda and Jamise appeared.

Jomi said, "Hello! Welcome to the Dark World, this is my castle, i hope you enjoy it!" 

Jamise said, "So.. what's your name? Also is this your home also? Where's your CR's? Bedroom? Kitchen? Tell me more!"

Urda said, "Jamise, sa tingin ko lang, nasobrahan na siya, tignan mo naman!"

Jomi is blank staring towards Jamise.

Jamise said, "Tama ka... Pasok na tayo sa loob.."

So both of them went into the castle, next was a few more students then lastly was Rhida and Mack.

Jomi said to herself, "Oh, finally.. the last ones."

Then she said, "Hi! Welcome to the Dark World! My Castle Town! You people are the last ones! So what are your names?"

Rhida said, "Well, my name is Rhida, he is Mack.. B'at gusto mo?"

Mack whispered to Rhida, "Sis, di siguro siya nagtatagalog??"

Rhida whispered back, "Ay, oo nga.."

Jomi said, "Well, i always track the first and last ones that enter my castle, it's for... remembrance. Anyways you guys can enter my castle now?"

Mack whispered again, "Teka lang, naiintindihan niya ang tagalog..."

Mack said to Jomi, "Nagsasalita ka ba ng Tagalog?"

Jomi said, "Uhh, opo?"

Rhida said, "Pwede mo ba sabihin na "Papatayin ko kayo!"? It's a word for "I like you all".

Jomi said, "Gusto ko kayong lahat?"

Rhida whispered to Mack, "Ay, alam niya 'to.. Pumasok nalang tayo sa castle?"

Mack agreed, "Ok!!"

Then they quickly rushed inside the castle.

Jomi said, "Well. I guess i should go in myself..." 

So she went in, and left the door out for anyone else.

From the doors you can see a huge staircase and multiple rooms beside the stairs. Behind the stairs was a huge room, like a gymnasium of a school. you can see a huge cluster of tables in the middle and chairs beside the walls. The chairs that look like the plastic chairs you would see in the light world. On the tables there were banana leaves as plates and food on top of it, fruits like bananas and papayas, eggs, fish like tilapia, and more.

Everybody was just talking about random stuff, then Mijo went to Jomi, just after entering the room.

Mijo asked, "Hey, so you have somewhat good advice.. How do you get the **teachers** and the **judges** to... not see the dark world? I mean the whole room's a dark world..." 

Jomi said, "Well, you could seal the fountain? I don't know who opens it but when it does, you guys go to where the red carpet begins."

Mijo said, "How about you? Also how will we go back here if the teachers stay for like a long time?"

Jomi said, "You can come back anytime, Mijo. and everybody else here too. Just, make a fountain?"

Mijo said, "And how do i do that? I only discovered the dark worlds, i didn't make them!"

Jomi said, "Well, i know a way of opening them..."

Mijo said, "What? Tell me!"

Jomi said, "Can i say it the prophecy way or the simple way?"

Mijo said, "Uhhhh, Prophecy way, 'cause that's more interesting and I can always just get the simple explanation right?

Jomi said, "Yes..."

Jomi readied herself and explained the prophecy...

Jomi said, "A long time ago, a _lightner_ was very bored and dissatisfied with their world and so went on a worldwide journey to find the perfect place to live. There, she met a _witch_, a witch that told tales of a **dark world** that was fun and adventurous but required someone determined enough and in possession of a _sharp_ object. She was that person, so she made one right outside the witch's hut which opened the veil between worlds, this amount of darkness outside, would cause **CHAOS**. So eventually, _three heroes_, a **king**, a **queen** and a **princess of the dark** locked her inside the darkness for which she stays until she comes back."

Mijo said, "So... In summary, sharp objects make a dark world and the three heroes stop the bad guy.."

Jomi said, 'I wouldn't say it like that but yes."

Mijo said, "Ok, so if someone opens the dark world, thats bad?"

Jomi said, "Yes? Well this one isn't exactly bad but if too many open or if the fountain expands way too much, the balance will break." 

Mijo said, "I see..." then he turned to the class.

Mijo announced, "Well, everybody! Go back the way you came.. We will return later. The teachers and judges are gonna come and leave here eventually..."

Fexili questioned, "Teka lang, ayaw niyo ba ipakita ang dark world na ito sa mga guro at judges?"

Jamise said, "Well, kasi nga, nasa kompetisyon tayo, so pag nakita nila ito, either hindi sila maniniwala na totoo ang lahat na nandito o i-disqualify tayo kasi, as far as we know, walang dark world yung iba."

Rhida said, "Tama ka dyan, Jamise, pero paano ang dark world? Mawawala lahat nito kung papasukin natin sila!"

Mijo said, "Not exactly, but pwede natin buksan ito mamaya. Trust me!'

So, everybody went back to the fountain in which they went out one by one until Mijo was the last one.

Mijo said, "Uh, are you sure you'll be fine?'

Jomi said, "Yes."

Mijo said, "Ok... Ok..." 

Then Mijo realized something, "Wait, how would for example if I move my bags in the light world, does it move in the dark world?"

Jomi said, "Hm, I don't know... Whatever happens, i will be fine."

Mijo said, "Ok. I'll go... I'mma test it out!"

So Mijo closed the fountain and the biology lab was back to its old form. Mijo was on the floor, laying there. The others were either trying to cover up the lab or were waiting for the darkness to go away.

Mijo said, "Well, what now..."

Jamise opened the door to find Mijo laying down on the floor.

Jamise said, "Hey! Mijo, what are ya' doing on the floor? And why are you just laying there??"

Mijo responded, "No, i was sitting here because there's no CHAIRS..."

Rhida was behind Jamise...

Rhida said, "Hindiii kaya, nakita namin kita na nakahiga lamang sa sahig..."

Mijo said, "Fine... you're right but uh lets organize this whole thing..." 

Rhida said, "Yeah! Ok so-"

The door opened again and JR appeared and said, "Pwede na po ba pumasok?"

Jamise said, "Oo, pasok na kayo!"

Then all of the other students went in and one by one went to their respective groups and the door was closed.

As the Rhida, JR, Jamise and others were preparing for the "Boodle Fight" competition, Mijo went to Leviente.

Mijo said, "Yo wanna play some chees?"

Leviente said, "Sure!" 

So he played chess with Leviente winning both as Black and White and Mijo won once as White.

As the class was doing random things such as JR playing Sukodu, Domez and Vink were playing with rubiks cubes, and the rest were either finishing up their last schoolwork or chilling.

Then suddenly Jamise announced, "8-Clam! Papunta na dito ang mga Teachers! Mag-ready na kayo!"

So 8-Clam readied themselves such as watching out for the teachers for the others, preparing poses and songs, readying to record and other fun stuff. They waited patiently, until...

Banya shouted, "They're here!!!!" and quickly went to the classroom.

As soon as the teachers opened the door, most of the class struck a pose and sang happy birthday for whatever reason. Not long after, the judges arrived.

Judge 1 said, "Ooohh, i like this one, yung parang sushi!"

Judge 2 said, "The design looks nice... 8-C-L-A-M, 8-Clam!"

Judge 3 said, "Hmmm, the bananas taste weird..."

The judges rate it 7/10. 8-Clam got last place...  So after that the class ate their last supper with the teachers. After cleaning up, and the teachers going out of the classroom, Mijo decided it was time. 

Mijo murmured to himself, "Hmmm, a pencil is sharp enough i think?"

So Mijo stabbed the pencil into the ground with full force, and dark smoke filled the room.

Fexili shouted, "Hey! Who turned off the ligh- oh..."

Yeasa said, "Why is it suddenly dark?"

Urda said weakly, "Oh, well ok then...."

They all fell to the dark abyss below and transformed into their respective dark world forms, it felt weird like a tingling feeling accompanying the clothes as they took over.

Mijo said, "Woah, it's nice to be back here!"

Jomi then appeared in front of the staircase, then looked at Mijo and said,
