# C1d DeltaRambles: Reunión de Avancé

A secret hidden in the very top...

Deltarune-inspired story: ()

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees his best friend Urda. She was waiting on him, because there was a good project they had to do, so they went, and not so long class was over. But after a while of cleaning, they went home but before going, 

Mijo said "Yo, so i heard of this rumor that like near the you-know emerald room, there was like a whole dark world-" 

Urda said "You really think that deltarune exists for real!" 

Mijo said "Unlikely, but hey the probability's there." 

Urda said "Really, how do you even access it? The room's dark or its-"

Mijo cut off "Alright maybe its not really there, BUT! I mean its open, i think?"

Urda said "Really, huh?" "Well if you keep talking about it, seriously dude."

So after closing up the class, they went to the place and tested the doors.. They were open! They entered but it was dark... Too dark. 

Mijo said "Ok, but like lets check if the lights work"

Urda said "So what, you can fall and- Oh, he's gone."

Urda then thought about what would happen if she was asked where Mijo could have gone or more boring days of school, and so she went in, but as soon as she went in she fell and the door closed.

*dark world shenanigans*

Draft Notes: Full of Grammar mistakes and general confusing execution but this is from the original one wrote so from this point i rewrite again.

Deltarune-inspired story:
Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees Urda, a random classmate. She was waiting on him, because there was a project they had to do, so they went to the classroom, but they got an opportunity to go home when the teacher announced:

Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayong 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-" 

Mijo said and everyone said "WOOO UWIAN NA!!!"

So, it was time to go home but Mijo's and Urda's service wasn't here yet and after going to the waiting shed- Suddenly, darkness explodes and it looks like it's near the Fajardo Building, near their classroom.

Mijo said "It's probably dangerous, but YOLO i guess..." 

Urda quickly cut in and said "Hoy! Mijo diba?"

Mijo surprised, said "Uh, yeah, Hey you wanna go to our classroom?"

Urda shocked, said "Bro, really?" paused and said Hindi ako pupunta malapit don PERO I am warning you!"

Mijo said "Good point, but-"

But then the darkness expanded and soon the floor was no longer safe. Mijo, sensing something was about to happen, quickly rushed to Urda.

Mijo said "I'm afraid, this might be our last day..."

Urda said "Well, kung ito ay ang parang alam ko, magiging okey tayo."

Mijo said "Huh? What does that mean?"

Suddenly the ground shook with fear and they fell to the darkness...

Author's Note: I am kinda not proud of this but the premise is good... I will just write the other parts, see where this goes. BTW the title is from miting de avance which is the filipino version of advanced meeting from my HCPSMSHS Election Days.

# C2 DeltaRambles: Into the Dark

Summary: Mijo and Urda discover new worlds and people?!?!

Author Note: taglish all around

Mijo woke up in the eternal darkness with only a platform. Surprisingly, the fall wasnt that bad. But he decided to stand up and look around. Oceans of darkness are all around and only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and after seeing weird black goop, he saw a bunch of cabinets and tables, perfect for hiding, and so he went there and as he was walking very loudly, he heard *someone*... So he readied up his sword (wait he had one?) and stay cautioned, ready for whoever was making that sound and suddenly Urda showed herself with a sword and flintlock pistol. 

"HEY! Who are you! Wait-" said Urda, surprised.

"OH, ay nako its just you..." said Mijo, also suprised.

"DAMN... Malapit na kitang barilin! Dapat meron kang sinabi..." said Urda apologetically.

"Yeah, woops sorry!! Well what do we do now???" said Mijo, as he put his sword away.

"Huh, waait a minute... Meron ka lang espada... Ako merong espada AT baril!" said Urda, mockingly.

"Well, that doesnt matter, i can deflect your bullets with my sh-" but there wasnt a shield in his inventory... "-sword! Yeah.. my sword.." said Mijo embarrassed.

"Haha! But ok punta kaya tayo, uh doon?" said Urda, pointing towards the only path not going backwards. 

"Aight, let's go!" said Mijo.

They went together towards the darkness and after walking a lot, they saw a school that had like a gate and guardhouse like HCPSMSHS! 

"Yo! We found something! Its honorato?" Mijo said, very confused.

"Whaat? Uh nakikita mo ba na may tao?" Urda said, also confused.

"No... Can we go in?" said Mijo confirming.

"Kung hindi, meron tayong.... isa pang opsyon."
said Urda, pointing to her gun. 

"Sure. But like we DON'T have to... I'll join you though if it ever comes to that however.. " said Mijo, thinking about it.

"Fiiine... Sisiguraduhin mabait ako... Sa kanila..." Urda said, whining.

So they went in, and the gate opened for them.

"Ok???" Mijo said, being confused at the whole situation. Urda kept quiet, silently observing everything.

They turned towards the gym and saw everyone! 

"Uh..." Mijo said, then saw a person and said "Hi! Do you know- wait he is just.. ignoring me!" Hey!" Mijo said, getting more anxious decided to ignore it and move towards the gym but then time quicky flew by from 3:00 PM to 5:05 PM.
As fast as they walked in, it was suddenly time to leave.

Urda spoke up. "Ayah, ano ang nangyayari dito? Puro nakakabaliw na nakikita natin, siguro meron nangyari satin ah, Mijo?"

Mijo rebutted, "Well, right ka, nahulog tayo papunta sa dilim, but kasi kung namatay tayo, dapat ba kaya merong tayong makikitang demonyo dito?"

Urda answered, "Luh, baga ito ang personal na hell sa atin-"

Mijo interrupted, "O pwede itong yung... Alam mo yung deltarune?"

Urda said "Yeah, you reminded me of it when uh, i discovered your fanfic! Though i barely remember it, only gameplay."
