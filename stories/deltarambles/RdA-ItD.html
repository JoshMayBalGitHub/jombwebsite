## Summary: 

A normal school boy and his friend discover a new darker world unexpectedly during a normal school day, they hope to survive and live to tell the tale..

## Author's Note: 

Hey, so as you can see, this is now officially the third draft of the chapter 1, I see multiple things that could've been improved so I decided to rewrite this, hopefully it should be finished quickly.

As for the general notes, deltarune worlds mixed with genshin elemental system, and this can change, but my goal is to just have a satisfying beginning, so any reader strapped for time will be hooked at the beginning.

"Miting de avance" = "Reunión de Avancé" from the original HCPSMSHS Election 2022 that I cared about, unlike the future ones due to school stress. Taglish (Tagalog/Filipino + English) is here too, so learn Filipino lol.

————————————————————————————

A phone alarm is ringing as a certain boy is sleeping soundly in his bed, before his mom suddenly appears near his bed and wakes him up. "Mijo, Mijo Cala! Gising na! Kain na!" shouted May, his mom as he slowly opens his eyes and turns off his phone alarm and looks at his other digital alarm clock as he realizes he slept through that, and that it's 6:10, when he was supposed to wake up at 5:30.

"I'll be going, kumain ka na." said May, before she goes to the kitchen and continues her cooking for the lunch of her, his dad, and him.

"Yeah, yeah.. Ugh..." said Mijo, as he goes out of his bed, and slowly and sleeplessly walks to the living room and to the table and sits down to eat. As he eats rice with hotdogs and fried eggs, he wonders to himself, "I just.. wonder, what would happen if I got a chance to explore those worlds, in those ARPG games.. Sure, the characters can be your way to experience the world, but.. it's just not the same as if I was dropped on those worlds, since.. it's still a game."

"Oh, Mijo? Tapos ka na? Here's your towel, go go go, malalate ka!" said June, his dad before he continues his preparation for work, such as taking his plate and going to the sink with the other dirty plates to clean all of it.

"Uhuh.." said Mijo to himself, as he goes to the bathroom and takes a shower, and after that, he goes and brushes his teeth, before he switches to his school clothes and grabs his things, and goes to his father's motorcycle, as his father drives him to school and after arriving, waves him goodbye.

He goes inside the gate of his school, and tries to go to his room at the biology laboratory, currently being used by his section due to the unavailability of a proper room for his section. However before he could take a single step, he was stopped by Urda, a random classmate also arriving at the same time.

"Hoy! Mijo! I just finished the poster drawing and we have to complete it together, kasi.. kailangan talaga ng explanation..." said Urda, as Mijo noticed, and nodded while they went together to the classroom.

Hours pass as the school day goes on normally, until their lunch break where their adviser, Mam Maris announces, "Oo nga pala, 12:00 PM uwian na ninyo—"

Then everyone in the class collectively shouted, "WOOOO UWIAN NA!!!", before they packed up their bags and talked about their early dismissal, as the class cleaners cleaned the room and other people went out, Mijo decided to approach Urda.

"Uhh.. Hey..? Um.. about the—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupts, "T—the project? Yeah, I passed it, Mam Maris also said to pass it today, so that's done..!"

"O— oh, I see.. You um.. want to—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupts again, "Yes..! L— let's play Shingen later.. I'll message you when I am available.."

"Oh, cool cool.. Um.. Let's just talk about stuff  in the waiting shed then.." said Mijo, before Urda nodded and they headed together to the waiting shed.

As the school emptied out, they talked about random videogames and school topics, getting lost in their conversation, before suddenly, dark smoke explodes from the Fajado Building, near their classroom.

" *Gasp* Ooohh, what is that?!" said Mijo, surprised as Urda notices too and says, "What the?! Ano nangyayari?!"

"I don't know.. Hey, you wanna go nearer?" questioned Mijo, before Urda quickly said, "No! Whatever we do, we are never— ever going near.. that!"

Then the darkness expands as the floor starts to crack and seep dark smoke. Mijo saw this, and decided to hug Urda.

"Oh shiiit, this might be our last day..!" said Mijo, as Urda visibly blushes and squirms, before saying, "Y— yeah..! B— but.. if this is like what I think this is, then we're going to be fine.."

"Huh..? What specifically..?" questioned Mijo, before the ground shook and finally gave way, as they stopped hugging and fell separately from each other.

Mijo woke up in eternal darkness lying down with only a white platform below him. Surprisingly, the fall wasn't that bad, and so he decided to stand up and look around. Around him, there are oceans of darkness and he sees only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and as he walks, he hears his steps that are unusually loud and sees around him weird black goop before he sees a large drop with a bunch of green cabinets and brown tables, sporadically placed.  Since there was nowhere to go, he decided to jump down, and walk around. Seeing the cabinets and tables more closely, he realizes these could be good hiding spots just in case he ever needed one. However, as he walked he heard *someone* else's steps, so he stopped himself and somehow summoned a sheath of a sword that he was surprised by, but considering the other person could be dangerous, he doesn't question it and takes the sword out of its sheath, getting some experience due to his hobby of collecting weapons. He readies himself as he looks around him, staying cautioned, ready for whoever is making that noise. Suddenly, Urda showed herself with a sword and a flintlock pistol.

"HEY! Who are you?! Wait.." said Urda surprised, before realizing that he was just Mijo. "Oh.. Ay nako, 'kaw lang pala eh.." said Mijo, as he realizes that the unknown being is just Urda.

"Damn.. I was about to kill you, you probably should have said something.." said Urda apologetically, before Mijo says back, "Yeah.. you too.", as he puts his sword away, back in its sheath. 

"Well... what do we do now?" said Mijo, as they get closer. "Hmm, you have a sword.. specifically a katana?" said Urda, as she notices his sheath that he is currently holding.

"Hmm, yeah..? Maybe..? I don't know... there's a difference in length— Anyways.. How about your sword and pistol?" answered Mijo, as Urda replies, "I guess.. it's fine..? But.. I don't know if the gun actually works or not.."

"Oh right.. Well, let's go straight ahead.. It's not like we can do much, and.. just landing here is already tiring.." said Mijo, as Urda nodded and unconsciously made her pistol and sword disappear and added, "True. Hmmm, have you found any sparkling star or something..?"

"Huh? Ohh! No. Unfortunately." answered Mijo, understanding her reference to a certain videogame where a save point looks like a sparkling star. "Aww.. Ok, let's go..", said Urda in response.

They then walked around the place trying to find a way out, finding the massive wall that was from the high up platform, then after walking around for a while, they finally found a pathway that leads somewhere, however they couldn't see very far anyway.

"Be ready.. Who knows what we'll find..." said Mijo, before they walked together to the pathway. As they ran, they saw the landscape that looked to be endless pillars of white stone and black liquid until they landed at an area that was beside a gate that led inside a school that seemed familiar..

"Hey.. Isn't that Honrato? Honrato K Parez—" remarked Mijo, before being nudged by Urda to shut up. "Shhh.. You see anyone?" whispered Urda as they looked around the school to see no one.

"Uh.. no. But, I understand your concern... They might be just hiding... Ready up your weapons, then we'll.. enter by smashing the lock, if we can.. anyway." whispered back Mijo, before Urda nodded and unconsciously summoned her weapons back. "W— wait, wait.. You can do that?!" said Mijo, as he noticed her sudden magical powers.

"H— huh? Do what? These bad boys have been with me the entire time.. or not..? Huh.." responded Urda, as she looked at her weapons. "Hmm.. Let's enter the school first, then we'll figure the magic system later.. We can't really take guesses here.." said Mijo, before Urda looked at Mijo, nodded and together they walked nearer the gate.

But, as they got closer, suddenly the gate opened up on its own as the school is now available with them, without resistance. They got even more suspicious as they entered the school, keeping their blades close to them as they entered. They walked around, seeing the digital clock at the top of the gym, displaying 3:00. Then, they saw a hooded figure appear on the 2nd floor of the Fajado building, as they were just staring at them.

"Huh?? Who is that?!" said Mijo, before the hooded figure disappeared in purple mist. "Uh oh, we are—" added Urda, before the sudden appearance of the hooded figure in front of them. Both of them got shocked and are now pointing their weapons at the hooded figure.

"Welcome, I am the Princess of this.. Kingdom. El Reino de Oscuridad. Do not be alarmed, lightners. Put down your weapons, and I shall foretell the **_FIRST_** Prophecy." said the hooded figure, before the other two looked at each other and talked to each other. "Uh.. you're thinking what I am thinking..?" said Mijo to Urda, before Urda responded, "Yeah.. Haha..!", then they both looked at the hooded figure, and collectively said, "Nah.."

"Umm..? R—really? I mean— It's pretty important to your journey, so.. I think you two would want to hear it..? Right..?" responded the hooded figure, as the two respectively put their weapons away. "Mmm.. What do ya think..? Should we?" questioned Mijo to Urda, before Urda answered, "Mmm.. Yeah, sure.. But.. don't be surprised if I randomly walk away."

"O—oh? T—that's good. *Ahem* A long time ago, three heroes, a king, a queen and a princess of the dark made a pact, an alliance to protect the world against all evil, to save all. This alliance was tested against a lightner opening the veil, causing *CHAOS* to envelop both worlds. Only them, can seal the fountains, and banish the abyss. Only then will the balance be restored. And so, the *WORLD* was saved from the totality of the abyss. But recently, the abyss has surfaced once more, and with it, new heroes must stand up, and defeat evil once again." explained the hooded figure, as Mijo listened and Urda unsurprisingly stopped listening after half-heartedly listening for a while, and explored the area as the hooded figure didn't notice her leaving.

"As you can tell, the prophecy can be us three— Wait, where's the.. other lightner?" questioned the hooded figure, as she looked around her. "She left, she's probably walking around the school right now.." answered Mijo, as the hooded figure audibly gasped and responded, "W—what?! Um.. There's a reason I met you here, the.. town is quite empty. A—and uh.. let's go!", before she grabbed him and they ran around the school, seeing her near the Fajado building.

"Hey! I am going, jeez.. What's your name, anyway? Can't keep calling you hood guy, or gal.. haha." said Mijo, as they ran to Urda's position. "Jomi, the princess of the dark... What's the name of you two?" questioned Jomi as they caught up to Urda.

"I am Mijo, and she is named Urda." answered Mijo, before Jomi shouted to Urda, "DON'T!", before Urda opened the room to the biology lab and they got closer. "Y—you two are not ready yet.. Mmm.. Ok, stay here. I'll contain the.. corruption." said Jomi, as she immediately went inside the biology lab that the inside contained another world entirely, filled with armed skeletons that have weapons. Then she closed it, before Mijo tried to open it and it was locked.

"Uh.. are you fine..? You seem to have.. thoughts about the whole thing.." said Mijo, as he looked at Urda, filled with thoughts of regret, guilt and anger. "I.. I am fine. Mmm.. Just, mmmm.." responded Urda before she moved away from him, with her back turned.

"I see. I'll stay here if you need me." said Mijo, as Urda walked away until she was no longer seen as she turned left hiding her behind a corner.

"Mmm... I.. don't think this is as easy as we thought it was, hmm.. like she said, we might not have our magic yet.." said Mijo to himself, before the door suddenly opens with Jomi and a bunch of skeleton remains behind her. "It's done." said Jomi, before she went to Mijo and closed the door.

"Where's.. Urda?" questioned Jomi, before Mijo answered with a mixed look on his face, "She's right around that corner. Don't go to her though."

"Ah.. Mmm.. Well I understand. Let me show you around—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "No need. I know my way around this anyway, it looks familiar to a certain place I go to almost everyday."

"I see.. Then we can go to the library, I have some information you might find interesting." said Jomi, before Mijo nodded and they headed in the same direction that Urda went, consciously trying to distance themselves from her, after a while they went inside the library, and walked for a bit.

"This is it. Now, we can—" said Jomi, before Urda appeared behind them. "Hi, sorry for.. that. Let's just continue the adventure."

"Hmm, alright." responded Mijo, before he turned to Jomi and asked, "How do we.. well wait, you told me there was the abyss.. So, like.. what is our role again?"

"Great question. So like I was saying, the princess in the prophecy is obviously me, and the king and queen can be you two, respectively!" answered Jomi, as Urda went closer to Mijo and Jomi walked around.

"Huh.. It's a bit different, I guess the lore has to be original.." remarked Urda, as Mijo smirked and added, "Yeah duh, otherwise... A— Anyways, how do we.. take care of this abyss threat?"

"U— um, well.. That is also what I wanted to talk about, I have been looking around in my castle, but all of it only applies to darkners, which means whatever the case is, I don't know how you two will get your powers." answered Jomi, as the other two listened carefully. "Huh, but she can make her weapons disappear..." said Mijo, as he looked at Urda's hands.

"Oh yeah, can you explain that, Jomi? If we don't have powers, then how could I do that?" questioned Urda to Jomi, before Jomi stopped walking and pondered it for a while. "Well.. It's probably innate in this world then.. Try it again, I'll observe." answered Jomi, as the two nodded and Urda decided to summon her weapons again, and asked Mijo, "Hey, can you do it too?"

"Hmmm.." said Mijo, as he makes his sword and sheath disappear and appear in his hands. "Just as I thought, according to.. you know what, it's basically.. a magic inventory connected to your energy." explained Jomi, before Mijo and Urda snickered and Mijo commented, "Haha, I see. So, depending on how powerful or what our powers are, can we carry anything?"

"Yeah..? But, I would recommend keeping actual weapons, but.. I'll.. uh.. explain the details, when I study a bit more.." answered Jomi, as the two nodded, and Urda asked, "So.. like, hmm.. How can we.. go home? Like, to the light world i think?"

"Huh, well.. We have to go inside the biology lab and seal the fountain there, the skeletons you saw.. they're too far gone unfortunately.." answered Jomi, as Mijo and Urda looked at each other and to Jomi once she finished talking. "Well, let's go! We have to go home anyway, as fun as this dark world is..." said Mijo, before Urda agreed and nodded.

"I see.. Then, let's—" said Jomi before a knock is heard and they look into the door to the library, only to realize that skeletons have invaded the castle. "Huh?! How?" said Jomi, as she grabbed her sword and guarded the door, as the other two slowly walked away from the door.

"This is the cause of *abyss* corruption.. We weren't supposed to meet here anyway, but *abyssal* corruption.. Affected this area..." said Jomi, as she fought off the skeletons armed with swords.

"Woah.. Really..?" said Mijo, before Jomi said, "Let's go, you two have to make it through the bio lab door, sorry.. I thought I had more time.."

Then she dragged the two and burst out of the door, and protected the group as they made their way to the door, as they ran, the two also tried to fight off the skeletons that were getting to them, with mixed success. Then they arrived at the bio lab door.

"Quick, I know you can do it, you'll meet me soon anyway, I just have to find another way. Go!" said Jomi, as she opened the door and pushed the two inside then she closed it suddenly, leaving the two with a bunch of hostile skeletons in an unknown field of trees and ruined structures.

"Hey! Where?!" shouted Mijo, as the door closed, leaving the answer unknown. "Mijo... we should focus at.. *them.* " said Urda, as he turned to see the skeletons slowly walking to them with swords and spears.

"Ah! Damn, looks like we're gonna have to fight then." said Mijo, as he aimed his sword towards the skeletons, and Urda did the same. "Ok, let's dance!" said Mijo, as he charged straight to the skeletons, surprisingly deflecting and hitting shots at the skeletons, as Urda stayed behind, figuring out if her guns worked.

"Hey! Help me here! I can't just fight endlessly!" shouted Mijo to Urda, as he slowly retreated and started to have a more defensive stance against the skeletons. "I am trying to. This gun has to work, or we'll die anyway." responded Urda, as she tried to resonate any magic she could feel. After a whole lot of stabbing, reflecting and slashing the skeletons, eventually Mijo was pushed back near Urda, as skeletons approached even closer.

"Urda!" shouted Mijo, as Urda tried to defend herself, however with less background in physical training, she got easily overwhelmed and her sword was disarmed from her. "No! I will not—" shouted Mijo again before being disarmed and a skeleton using his blade against him by stabbing him right in his heart. "Mijo? Mijo!?" shouted Urda, as she looked to her left to see a skeleton pulling the sword of Mijo out of Mijo's chest before he fell to the ground.

"Mijo.. ugh.. We underestimated this world.." said Urda, as she fell to the ground, she began to think of her life and her end here... However, before she could be slashed, suddenly lightning  and intense wind was heard around her, as she was awakened by the sound of it. "H—huh..?" said Urda, as she slowly looked around her.

"You.. shall die!" said a voice near her as she sees a figure use a sword to slash the space around her, targeting the skeletons, creating ripples in space that looks like cut glass before the figure stops and sheathes the sword, before the skeletons disintegrate to pieces.

"I—is that..? Mijo.." said Urda, before she fell into the ground, closing her eyes and blocking her vision. "Come on, wake up." said Mijo, as he helped Urda get up. She is breathing heavily as Mijo sits down next to her. "Huh, that was interesting. But.. I am still injured.. if only one of us was a healer.." said Mijo, as he looked at the barren area.

"Yeah..." said Urda, as they both looked out, resting from their battle. A few minutes passed as they silently watched the barren land before Mijo said, "Huh, I thought more skeletons would be appearing.. Welp, let's continue. If Jomi were planning to meet us somewhere, it's not here.", as he stood up and offered to help Urda. She accepted and she stood up too, and before Mijo could say anything, she hugged him tightly for a minute before she stopped and said, "Let's go then." before they walked together to the barren land. They walked, this time with their weapons close as skeleton remains piled up near them. 

"What happened here..? I thought I only killed the skeletons where we were, what is this..?" said Mijo, as they checked out a destroyed skeleton with purple scars, likely from slashes.

"Huh, purple..? That's weird.. Is that like, abyss stuff or is it Jomi's doing, 'cause she has like a purple aura whenever she uses her magic.." noted Urda, as they looked at the skeleton. "We don't know, but keep it in mind i guess, if Jomi went through here, we must be near her, let's continue." said Mijo, before they continued their walk, looking very carefully at the surroundings.

As they walked, Mijo tried to lighten the mood. "Hey, so.. have you played.. Shingen Inpakuto?" asked Mijo, as they continued walking, "Yeah, why? Do you play it too?" answered Urda, raising her eyebrows at this question, with a smirk. "Uh... kinda? I just started.. but I am at AR 16 so.." responded Mijo, with a shy smile.

"Cool~ We can play together then, I also want to have a friend to grind stuff with.." said Urda, now with a full smile. "Niice.. Though we have to survive this first." said Mijo, with Urda chuckling and adding, "Yeah, true.."

Then they climbed a staircase that led to an elevated point, with ruins around as they stopped when they saw a _familiar_ star twinkling to the right of them. "Huh, is that... a save point?!" said Mijo, looking at the star. "No way... Whoever made this world, gave us one here?!", added Urda as they inspected the star.

"Who just leaves a save point right after the first battle, or ugh.. Let's just save while we can..." exclaimed Mijo before he touched the star then suddenly he fell to his knees, dropping his weapon as he absorbed the star, with pained sounds.

"Huh?! What the?!" shouted Urda as she moved closer to Mijo. "No no no, please.." said Urda as she helplessly looked at Mijo before the star was absorbed, making him fall to the floor. "Don't.. please.." said Urda, almost in tears as she caught Mijo, seeing his closed eyes.

"Ugh... Urda? What happened..?" said Mijo, before Urda helped him get up. "I don't know! You touched the star then you suddenly started absorbing it! But it looked like you were in pain, so I got closer but.. I.." explained Urda before stopping herself. "Could it be a power up? Like a collectible but for some reason it hurts you?" said Mijo, thinking out loud as he picks up his weapon. "Hey, mmm.. I.. uh.. um.." said Mijo, noticing Urda's emotion. "I am fine, really... Just, promise me you won't kill yourself like that again." said Urda, also noticing Mijo's behavior.

"Haha.. I'll try. I wonder what it did though.." responded Mijo, the mood being less heavy as they contemplated their situation. "I just hope that it's not like a corrupting force or something.. hopefully." added Urda, as they stood up and looked over the land again.

"Huh, see that? There's someone fighting skeletons, quick! They could be Jomi!" said Mijo, before they rushed to that figure's position with their weapons. They ran and ran, nearer to the huge castle that overlooked the ruins outside of it as they met the figure fighting some skeletons. They see a hooded figure using a sword with a hilt fighting some skeletons with purple magic.

"Wait, that magic.. that's Jomi!" said Urda, now looking at the figure battle as they watch from nearby. "Yeah! Come on, let's watch from afar." added Mijo, as they watched farther from her behind some ruin.

"Out of my way!" shouted Jomi, as she summoned slashes before slashing nearby skeletons. "You're finished!" again shouted Jomi, as she cut down more skeletons, sending them flying up before she herself flew up slashing them, sending them down and smashing any remaining semblance of life.

"I know you're there. Come out." said Jomi, as she noticed the two hiding behind a ruin. "Yeah, yeah.. What happened? How'd you get here?" questioned Mijo to Jomi, as they walked towards her, but she didn't respond, only sheathing her blade. "Uh.. you uh.. gonna respond?" asked Urda, as they walked closer to Jomi. Then as they finally made it to Jomi, she suddenly teleported to Mijo and used her magic to check something and Mijo was restricted from moving using magic, as Urda noticed and summoned her blade.  "What. are. you. doing?!", before Jomi knocked Urda back using her sheath to stop Urda from stopping her. 

Then as soon as Urda landed on the floor, she suddenly saw in slow motion, as she moved normally. She stood up then she moved towards Jomi before she saw Jomi suddenly look at her and unsheathe her sword as she out maneuvered Urda, forcing her out of the slow motion, as she fell into the ground again.

"Agh! Ugh.. Why..?" said Urda, as she looked at Jomi sheathing her sword. But again, Jomi didn't respond as she continued to use magic to check Mijo. Mijo was trying to say something, but he was in pain as he was being checked by Jomi. "A—are you even Jomi?!" questioned Urda, as Jomi continued to check Mijo. Then Mijo after a whole lot of struggle and pained expression, was fainting as he closed his eyes, Jomi noticed this and finished checking as she dropped him to the floor.

"I see. It has affected you too. But, I.. can't.. I have to, it's not done yet." said Jomi to herself, as she looks at Mijo then the castle. "I should probably explain myself... But, anymore of this, and.. ugh.. At the same time, I need to.. mmm.." said Jomi to herself again, as she looks at the two and the castle. "Hey! What was that for?!" questioned Urda, after she ran to Mijo's position with her summoned blade and pistol as she stares down Jomi's back. 

"Hm, well.. I noticed that you two have powers now, and that's good. But, specifically.. the star that Mijo has, it's a revival item. It can only do so, if the user has enough willpower to absorb it. I simply checked if he had one, and that had some unintended side effects. It is because of the abyss magic that has spread, it's affecting Mijo less. I sensed it." explained Jomi, as she turned to face them, as Mijo woke up to see Jomi. "Then, why didn't you just ask?! You could've avoided the fight!?" questioned Urda, as Jomi contemplated her actions. "I.. use abyss magic." answered Jomi, as the two gasp at this answer. "W—what?!" said Urda as she maintained her gaze at Jomi, wide eyed. " *sigh* I have to be honest with you, that doesn't fully explain it, but.. trust me, I have your best interests in mind. Here, I will heal you both, you need it for the final battle with the skeleton king in the castle." explained Jomi, as she approached the two. "I don't trust you! You have proven to betray our trust earlier, and you almost killed both of us, twice! If you include the part where you left us, powerless to fight against hordes of skeletons!" said Urda, as she got Mijo behind her as she glared at Jomi.

"I.." said Jomi, as she stopped and suddenly a purple aura started to appear at Jomi's body and her eyes started to glow purple. "Oh no, what's happening to her?! Get prepared, Urda!" said Mijo, as they both prepared their weapons. They watch as she uses her hand to use magic,  at her heart, as she absorbs purple and dark magic into her hands, then she grabs her sword, "Keep your eyes peeled..!" said Mijo, as he walked and stood beside Urda. Then she unsheathes her blade as time slows down, as Mijo and Urda both watch as Jomi looks at them and says, "I am.. sorry. I.. should've been stronger.", before looking at the castle and with her magic, disappearing in a purple mist, time going back to normal. Then after a while, the castle is suddenly filled with a bunch of purple slashes as the walls collapse.

"Woah! What is happening?!" shouted Mijo as they looked at the castle. "I.. don't know.. Let's go there now! We have no choice." said Urda, before they ran to the castle. They ran and ran, seeing the other skeletons, until they entered the castle through a destroyed door, then they continued as they saw more armored skeletons on the floor as they moved through the castle, seeing the destruction caused with cracks and slashes all around the barely holding stone structure as they finally entered the throne area and saw Jomi, based off the purple aura and hood. But they also saw a big skeleton king, that had full armor with a big sword.

"Haha.. Abyss Princess.. You can't hide, no matter how you suppress your own magic, the deaths here are miniscule compared to when I finally take yours and the lightner's power! The skeletons shall reign forever!" said the skeleton king, as Mijo and Jomi show up behind Jomi as they listen.

"You still dare to challenge me? You're too delusional, I don't need to fight you, I just needed to create a path for.. those two to fight you!" said Jomi, as she pointed to the lightners behind her, noticing them when they arrived earlier.

"H—huh?! Hey! We just arrived!" said Mijo, as the skeleton king stares at them. "Yeah! And Jomi? Are you just going to stand here after you decimated the entirety of his armies?" added Urda, as they panicked at the notion of already fighting one of the strongest enemies that they have ever faced.

"Haha.. I have my own reasons, just.. figure it out, will ya?" said Jomi, as she approached them. "And.. I'll just   watch, if he tries to pull any ambush using other skeletons, I'll see to it that it's a win for us." said Jomi, as she laid down next to them at a wall near them. "Uh.. so, so.. like.." said Mijo, before Urda interrupted, "Nuh uh, let's kill the king first, he wants our powers!"

"I'll take yours first then, lightners! You'll see, the skeletons will have their freedom! A new world, without our oppressors!" said the skeleton king, as the two lightners approached. "Who's the oppressors? Jomi? Or.." questioned Mijo, as Urda interrupted again, "Ugh.. Why do you _need_ to know?"

"It won't matter. I am only part of a greater revolution, you'll find it out from my brethren. Now, die!" said the skeleton king before he started to prepare to fight. "Ok, let's dance!" said Mijo, before unsheathing his blade. "Prepare for defeat, then!" added Urda, as she used her wind powers to fly. "Wait, you can do that?" asked Mijo, as he looked at Urda. "Apparently?! Let's focus!" answered Urda, as they focused at the skeleton king.

They quickly acted as Mijo charged head-on deflecting and parrying all offense from the skeleton king as Urda goes around the skeleton king and shoots him, while also sending wind slashes, as Mijo watches both Urda's and the skeleton king, making sure to dodge as much as he can. Due to this coordinated effort, the skeleton king was being overwhelmed.

"I might be one of the last skeletons alive, but that doesn't mean I am the only one alive! Scopicro! Go!" shouted the skeleton king, as a skeleton with a white coat appeared behind Mijo and stabbed Mijo in the heart. "Surprised?"  whispered Scopicro, as he pulled out his glass bladed sword with a white hilt, while Mijo dropped to the floor. "No! NO!" shouted Urda, as she quickly redirected her shots to Scopicro as he disappeared into a glass portal.

"I shall go back to observing at the—" said Scopicro as he went into the portal and before it closed, Jomi stopped him by grabbing him and throwing him at the skeleton king, causing them to fall over, as Jomi quickly teleported to Mijo to heal him. "Go! Urda! take care of those two, I'll heal Mijo, then.. I'll finish this." said Jomi, before she quickly healed Mijo, as Urda kept targeting Scopicro and the skeleton king, eventually coming down with a big smash. After healing Mijo, Jomi quickly teleported to the Scopicro and said, "Found you." before finishing off the two with a destructive slash, leaving only bones, glass shards and the sword of the skeleton king.

"Oh come on, why do I always have to get stabbed.. Thanks Jomi, by the way." said Mijo, as he stood up and looked at Jomi. Urda soon descended and looked at the remains, as Mijo quickly ran to join them.

"You're welcome. Now.. what to do with this..." said Jomi, as the three looked at the remains. "There's a sword remaining, think we can use it?" remarked Mijo, before Urda responded, "Probably, what? Do you want to dual-wield?", as she chuckled. "Heck yeah! Of course! I love using different sword forms!" answered Mijo, before Jomi said, "Hmm, it's.. about to break though, unlike your blades which are more durable due to your magic. Maybe you can try wielding it, Mijo... See if you can wield it properly."

"Yeah, I don't need it, I already pretty much dual-wield a pistol, and a sword so, you can keep it." said Urda, before Mijo picked up the sword and it glowed blue, like his magic. Then he tested it, going away from the group, before he slashed and stabbed the air, accidentally destroying some stone. "Woah, cool~" said Urda, as Mijo puts his new sword behind his back magically attaching like it had a sheath attached to his clothes.

"Yep, alright! That's the second weapon out of three i need to complete the 'alpha and omega' loadout.." said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted, "Shush. I know what that means, stop with the videogame references!", as the two are shocked. "Huh?! Wait, you know about videogames?!" questioned Urda, as both of them now looked at Jomi, regretting what she said. "Ugh.. I was going to do it, more dramatically but.. Mijo, I have a feeling you've already noticed, right?" answered Jomi, as she expectedly looks at Mijo. "H—huh? On what specifically..?" responded Mijo, as Urda and him got more confused, raising their eyebrows.

"I am talking about my origin, and.. I feel like, you should explain it yourself, since this is about you, mainly." answered Jomi, as Urda now gets more interested, and stares at Mijo. "Hmm.. Well, now that you confirmed it, I gotta say, nice body... Guess' I was thorough.." said Mijo, as Urda audibly gasped. "Hol' on, so... Let's just say she knows me much as I do, but I know her as much as a stranger, before meeting her of course. Look, it gets into my personal feelings and deepest secrets, and I don't want to share stuff yet."

"Uhuh... Well, hmm... Me too, in the secret part, as for.. uh.. the body statement and the vague statement on your relations are.. interesting, definitely expanded my view on you. Though, we gotta go home now.. I don't know about you two, but I am sooo tired.." responded Urda, as Mijo nodded and said, "I got stabbed a lot, what do you think?" said Mijo sarcastically, before Jomi says, "Yeah, yeah.. I have.. a lot of things to do, and I need you two to get out of here as soon as possible.", as she moved closer beside the throne, finally looking behind it at something.

"Like.. what?" asked Mijo, as Urda and him moved to Jomi's position. "Such as.. you know what, do you two know how to.. close this dark fountain?" answered Jomi, as the two looked at each other before Urda said, "Kinda, but we want a live demo, as we've only really seen it happen.", before Jomi nodded, and said, "There ya go, well.. just.. believe in yourself to get your heart out to the fountain, metaphorically...? Sorry, I've only read how it works, since it requires a lightner's magic, like you two."

"Oho.. Hey Mijo, you do it—" remarked Urda, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I'll do it, it seems I can take a lot of hits anyways.." responded Mijo, before they walked closer to the dark fountain.

"Will we see you again, Jomi?" asked Mijo, before Jomi answered, "We'll see.", before Mijo closed the fountain by materializing his heart out of magic then raising it to the fountain. Music played as light took over the vision of Mijo and Urda. Then they woke up in their classroom, the biology lab. They looked like they were sleeping and were dreaming, and now had woken up. They both looked around and saw each other.

"Yo, uh.. why are you still here after 12?" asked Mijo to Urda first, "H—huh? W—what's the time?", responded Urda before they checked both of their phones and realized it was already 5 PM. "WHAT?!", shouted Mijo and Urda, and rushed to get their things before going out of the biology lab. Urda was the first to get out, as notably she was closer and had less heavy things to carry, before Mijo also went out.

"Wasn't this supposed to be locked?" asked Mijo, as they exited through the door of the classroom. "Nakalimutan siguro...", remarked Urda, not trusting her other classmates. "Well, let's close it, then.. We might be screwed though, wala tayong susi eh.." said Mijo, before he started to close the door, "Bye..! Boner..!" said Urda to the biology lab's model skeleton as Mijo closes the door. "Bye! Skelly!", said Mijo as he finished closing the door, locking on its own. However the two didn't notice, as Mijo looked at Urda and said, "Hey, I stand by Skelly, that is the rightful name of the class skeleton!", as they both chuckled, and Urda responded, "Nah, it's Boner, trust. Because, I'd win. In class opinion, obviously."

"Oof whatever, we better go now.. Nag-aalala na siguro ang magulang natin, hehe.." said Mijo, as Urda responded, "Oh yeah, remember the shingen co-op later ok? Gotta go, bye! ", they waved goodbye to each other, as Mijo then looked at the door to check if it was locked. "Huh? It's locked? Oh whatever, I'll worry about it next week." muttered Mijo to himself before he too went home.

Things play out normally, as he chats with his father about not commuting at 12 and that he should pick him up, so he is picked up by his father, then they go home. As he browsed his phone while in the motorized tricycle, he noticed that his message about how he shouldn't commute didn't get sent, and that it failed for some reason. Mijo attributed this to the usual instability of his messaging app which he disliked but had to use. After they arrived at home, his parents started to ask Mijo about his day.

"So anak, how was your day?" asked June, as they ate at the table. "Pretty usual, although.. Nevermind.." responded Mijo, narrowing his eyes a bit as he focused on his food, which was adobo chicken with rice. "You know, anak.. Kung naka-uwi ka ng 12, you would be sleeping from 1 to 5, is there a reason why you didn't commute home earlier?" questioned June, as Mijo tried to hide his worry and panic on this question before he answered, "Uh.. because.. we... went out, yeah... and my friends went home, so I decided to go to the school to be picked-up instead, since.. y'know me and those tricycle drivers.. hehe.."

A disappointed sigh is heard from June before he said, "Next time anak, if you want to go out, that's fine. But, you should have told us where you were, and you really should've just went home earlier.." said June, as Mijo listens intently as he ate. "Yeah, yeah.. Next time, I guess." responded Mijo, as they continued to eat.

After a while, he sits at his chair in his computer room, and after opening up his laptop with a stationary setup, he decides to message Urda, since it was almost time to play.

"Whew.. It's a good thing, they didn't question what I did during that time, otherwise.. anyways. I better go check what Urda's doing." muttered Mijo to himself, as he opens the messenger website and goes to message Urda.

Mijo: Yo, were you bothered by your parents about the whole early dismissal?

Urda: NO uh not really i was about to message them then uhhhhh i fell asleep????

Mijo: did they get like a message about it like in the parents gc?

Urda: yeah but i was told to commute this day soo they didn't care

Mijo: well thats good i guess.

Urda: 👍

Mijo: Hey you ready to play SHINGEN INPAKUTO THE LATEST IMPACT IN GAMING!?!?!?
Reactions: 😆 - Urda

Urda: hold on my game is loading

Mijo: Aight kets go!!
Reactions 😆 - Urda

So Mijo and Urda played until the end of the night, momentarily forgetting about the so-called dream in the dark world.

## Notes:

Wait a minute, a chapter not stuck in development hell for 5 months? WOOOO 10 days baby!!! Anyways, this was a fun chapter to write, since I had to make sense and rework the general outline of Chapter 1, while making it make sense in the context of the future chapters, however seeing how it developed, I'll check the other chapters if needed for changes on things.

If you find inconsistencies in the future chapters, consider this one the most lore-accurate one of the bunch, and is the starting point of the story, so.. see you in chapter 2 rewrite! (lol) Maybe, but I'll mainly focus on Chapter 3, as it's almost finished, so stay tuned for that, anyways.. See you, next time! GOODBYE!

<md-block>
## Summary:
 
The duo find themselves facing the dark world once more, this time with new people joining as their fates are decided through chess. However, they're not alone in the discovery of the dark world, as some of their classmates try to find their lost friends.

## Author's Note: 

Heya, this is a more modified version of the previous draft, i made it into the second one, because the writing style and modifications are planned to be different from the previous ones.

However, since I had more experience when originally writing this, some points are only either expanded or reworked, due to the dependency on the previous chapter.

Anyway, as for general notes, the idea was brought up by an old friend, and I decided to do it originally due to my obsession with chess during that time. Hopefully this is also finished quickly.

ESP- Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao, basically philosophy and ethics

————————————————————————————

In a seemingly normal early school morning, Mijo is seen rushing to his classroom from the gate, with his heavy bags as he opens the classroom door and puts his things as he finally takes a seat.

"Oh, hello Mijo!" said JR, as he reads notes on something. "Hi! Uh.. so, what you doin'?" asked Mijo as he stands up to look at JR's notes. "Nagrereview para sa AP quiz later, ikaw ba?" answered JR, as Mijo sits back down and says, "No... Magrereview na nga ako..!" responded Mijo, before JR said, "Ok, I'll leave you alone then.", as he went and talked with another classmate.

Then Mijo got his bag and got his notes for AP, he read some notes until Urda showed up and got his attention. "Hey, Mijo.. So, uh.. I am about to say something crazy.. You should know about it." said Urda, as she visibly is shaking and is a bit nervous. "Ok.. Hmm, what is it then?" questioned Mijo, as he noticed her shaking.

"So, nakaranas ka na ba ng _dark world?_ " asked Urda, as Mijo's eyebrows raise and his mouth opens a bit. "Uh.. yes?!? Ikaw din? Kala ko panaginip lang 'yon!?" said Mijo, as he tries to contain his emotions.

"Oo nga eh! But.. the memories, they were too real.. 'di ko pa nakakalimutan..." answered Urda, as she winces remembering the dark world. "Well, ano gagawin?" questioned Mijo, as he noticed the others preparing to go out of the classroom for the flag-raising ceremony.

"Siguro meron na namang lalabas, like before. If nothing, we can always try later, at break maybe.." answered Urda, as Mijo questioned, "Hmm, gusto mo?", with one eyebrow raised. "Well.. oo. Na-obsess na 'ko eh.. Whatever happens.. May kasama akong mamatay haha.." responded Urda, as they awkwardly laughed at their situation. "Haha, I feel the same way—" said Mijo, before Jamise, their classmate and best friend of Urda comes in and interrupts, "Hoy! So ayaw ko talaga i-interrupt ang bonding  time ninyo, pero pinapapunta na talaga tayo sa gym."

Mijo and Urda glared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After they followed Jamise, they went out of the classroom, and headed to the nearest pathway to the gym until suddenly darkness spewed out of the chemistry lab, right next to the biology lab and was near the pathway too.

"Ah! What?" shouted Mijo, as the three looked to their left to see the door open and inside it only darkness. "Ah!? What?! What's happening?!" questioned Jamise, as the other two looked at each other and nodded. "Hoy! Do you two— Wait!!" asked Jamise, before the two interrupted her by running to the door and jumping in. "Huh, should I go in—" said Jamise to herself, before she got pushed in by the door into the darkness.

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise unexpectedly enter another dark world, their other classmates are just chilling as the flag raising ceremony happens, and someone in the class begins to question something.

"Hmmm, Mijo should be here.." exclaimed JR, as Leviente nods in agreement and says, "Good point, Jam isn't here too.." referring to Jamise who should be loud and noticeable by them. "Are they still in the classroom?" questioned JR, squinting his eyes. "No, but I swear I saw them.." said Leviente, before they focused on the ceremony.

Mijo and Urda both landed in the same area, however Jamise was nowhere to be found, and they landed in a life sized chess board with big statues of seemingly moveable chess pieces at their left and right respectively.

"Huh.. White or.. black? What do you think, Urda?" asked Mijo, as they looked around the area. "Uh... I don't know.. I don't play chess." answered Urda, before Mijo directed them to the white pieces. "White it is, then!" exclaimed Mijo, as they walk behind the white chess pieces to discover a miniature chess board with all of the pieces, likely controlling the big board.

"Welp, let's start— Woah, who's that?!" shouted Mijo, as they saw a figure with a black jacket and long black hair. "I don't know, but.. they're controlling the black pieces, i guess?" remarked Urda, as Mijo makes a first move with pawn to e4.

"Welp, either way.. I am winning this chess game, hopefully.." said Mijo, before black moves their pawn to e5. "Good luck.." commented Urda, before Mijo moved his knight to f3. "I got it, lemme focus so I can show you.. expert grandmaster level gameplay!" said Mijo, before focusing in chess.

The game continues as the black knight moves to f3, white knight moves to c6, black bishop to c4, white knight to g5, black pawn to h6, white queen to h5, black queen takes white knight at g5, white queen takes pawn at f7, black king moves to d8, and finally white queen takes black bishop g8, ending the game with an easy checkmate for white.

"Thats.. checkmate? Huh?! Who is dumb enough to fall for that?!" shouted Mijo, commenting and trying to get the attention of the black chess player. "I don't know... But, the other player lookin' very sus right now.." said Urda, noticing something from the black chess   player. "Yeah—" responded Mijo, before the two noticed the figure go nearer. 

They readied their weapons as the figure came closer and closer until they saw her face, a girl looking about the same age as them, with round glasses and long flowy hair. "H—hey! It's me! Jamise! Jamise Ribera.." said Jamise, as the two slowly lowered their weapons.

"Bruh... I— We thought you were an enemy! Of course we had our weapons out, buut.. the chess—" responded Mijo, before Jamise interrupted, "About that.. I heard your voices and instantly recognized it so when we were paired up to play chess, I was soo up for it, however.. I saw an opportunity to end the game quickly and I took it!"

"Huh? Why would you want to lose? If the consequences were instant death, and you lost... What are you gonna do..?" asked Urda, as Jamise immediately answered, "Nothing..! I didn't think that far enough.. But, I am sure that no games will lead to our deaths, right?", as she looked at the two nervously.

"Expect the unexpected, as a certain Leviente would say.. But, yes.. All threats have been direct, so far." answered Mijo, before Urda nodded, agreeing with his answer. "O—oh, whew.. That's good! Now uh.. what is even happening here?! Why are we all dressed like video game characters and where the heck are we?!" questioned Jamise, somewhat annoying the other two.

"Ugh, so Jamise, too long didn't experience.. This is an alternate world with dangerous monsters, cool powers and places to explore.. We also don't know where we are, since we also just arrived.” explained Urda, as Mijo nodded in agreement. "Yep, just come with us, you'll be safe." added Mijo, as Jamise raises her eyebrows in curiosity.

"Ok! About those powers, be specific!" asked Jamise, as the two looked at each other then Mijo responded, "Yeah yeah, we'll talk while walking, let's go. There was a nearby exit that appeared." responded Mijo, as the three walked out of the chess room and into the dark sky outside.

Meanwhile, in the light world.. The classmates of our three adventurers are worried about them, and so Rhida comes up to JR and Leviente.

"Soo.. do you two know about where in the world is Mijo... Jamise.. and Urda?" asked Rhida to her two classmates, as they talked about random topics. "No.. actually we were wondering too.." responded JR, as Leviente nodded and added, "I thought they would show up when the quiz or the snack break.. But they're _missing._"

_Lauvielle joined the conversation!_

"Wait! I—I saw them, near the room before I went out, they were soo late eh.." said Lauvielle, as the three looked at her with intense thought. "Let's go find them then!" exclaimed Rhida, as they prepared themselves.

*Meanwhile at Mijo and the gang*

As the lightners were looking around, they saw the endless piles of scientist gear, likely after a huge battle. However, they look around while talking to each other..

"Soo ok.. How are you guys so experienced already?!" asked Jamise, as they walked and the other two had their weapons on hand.

"Basically, Jamise.. the enemies never hide themselves.. usually. Oh, here's an enemy.." said Urda, as seemingly hostile people wearing scientist gear showed up. "Ano?! Hala?!" shouted Jamise as she hides behind Urda.

"Hold on, let Mijo handle this.. I'll explain what's happening." said Urda, as she dragged Jamise to look at Mijo and the battle. "Shouldn't you help Mijo?! I'll learn by watching, thank you." questioned Jamise, as Mijo fought the enemies.

"Nah, trust. He got this." said Urda, before Mijo easily styled and performed a lot of combo attacks against the enemies, as the other two watched. "You hear the music? It's weird, it feels like it's a mix of music I listen to, and I guess his.." remarked Urda, pointing out the background music playing while Mijo fought.

"W—wait.. So, in this world, you need to almost die to suddenly gain powers, and music plays too?! This feels like a fever dream.. like a videogame but too immersive.." responded Jamise, as Urda chuckled and nodded, "Yeah, but we accepted it at this point." said Urda, as Mijo finished by smashing the last enemy into the ground, disintegrating them.

"Whew.. Jamise, you learn anything new?" said Mijo, as he looks at the two. "Uh.. I don't know... Can we just stay here for a while? I wanna process what's been happening." answered Jamise, as the two nodded and they set off to find a nearby abandoned camp site.

Back in the light world, the group is trying to find their friends but they don't notice the chemistry lab being closed on a school day, and so they stumble around the school, going to the music room, cafeteria, physics lab, and a local school sanctioned shop by Mang Reyes, until they were going back to their classroom near the chem lab...

JR is listening to certain songs from the little mermaid, such as Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version) while the rest of the group stumble their way on their mission. "Hey, JR. You ever wonder why the chem lab is closed at this time?" said Rhida, as JR stopped and looked at Rhida with a disappointed expression. "Hay nako... Leviente! Lauvielle!" shouted JR, as the two went closer to JR and Rhida.

"What is it? Thought of something?" asked Leviente, as JR looked at them, maintaining disappointment. "Yes.. The chem lab. Let's check there." said JR, as Leviente responded, "Didn't Madam Principal say that the chem lab is closed? Huh, I guess they could've gone in anyway though.." as he realized what he was implying.

"Well, andito na tayo.." responded Lauvielle, as Leviente stepped closer to the chem lab door and opened it. As the door creaked, suddenly darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

"Perfecto! They must be here, I'll be going in." said JR, as he walked into the dark room and as soon as he put one foot down, he fell into the dark, towards the endless void. "JR!!!" screamed Rhida as JR fell.

"O—ok.. everyone agrees that we don't go nor do we talk about this until.. at least.." quickly said Leviente, as Rhida interrupted, "5:00 PM! Hmmm, what would we say to the teachers?"

"Let's.. hide the bags and say they're absent. That's probably the least obvious one..." said Lauvielle, as the other two nodded in agreement as they quickly headed back to class and grabbed their friend's bags as fast and unsuspiciously as possible. "Won't other people be sus of us?" questioned Lauvielle, as they threw the bags into the dark. "Haha, we're in too deep anyway. Let's just hope no one does." answered Leviente as they finished.

As their friends cover up their temporary disappearance, Mijo and the gang are sitting at a nearby campsite, without fire.

"I still don't get it.. How do you like.. actually gain powers? And don't say near-death experience again, because if you were there you wouldn't remember much due to... obvious reasons, right?" questioned Jamise, as the other two look like they're thinking about something else. "Yeah, but.. as far as I remember, one moment we were being stabbed by skeletons and the next moment I was lying down with Mijo.. with newfound powers, apparently." responded Urda, as she tried to recall her earlier memories.

"Ugh.. There's no point. We're only delaying the inevitable, our eventual.. you know what. Let's just move, we still need to get out of this place." said Jamise, before they heard someone fall and hit the ground.

"Sino yon? Let's draw our weapons, if you have any." said Mijo, as him and Urda draw their weapons, while Jamise summons a large staff that is taller than her. "Ahh! What the?! What is this? A—and how come you guys are already ready?" said Jamise, as she struggles to maintain her hold over the tall staff.

"We've been here before.. We're not getting ambushed again." responded Urda, as a person with a doctor look appears out of the darkness. holding a staff that has a snake wrapped around it on their right hand. On the left hand, they had what seems to be a kitchen knife. They immediately blast dark energy.

Urda and Mijo quickly dodge as Jamise tries to deflect the blast with her staff before getting blasted back. Mijo acted first quickly getting near the person only to look at this face clearer and realize that the doctor was JR, and that he was almost about to stab him, so he quickly moved away from him.

"Wait! Wait JR!" shouted Mijo, before JR stopped his other blast and responded, "Yes..? Wait.. Damn it.", as the other two got closer to Mijo.

"Yeah. I am Mijo. That's Urda, and that's Jamise!" said Mijo as JR went closer to the group. "Oh, nice." responded JR, before Jamise quickly questioned, "Hey! You just blasted us with.. whatever that was!"

"Yeah, uh.. I didn't recognize you three, especially you, Jamise, sorry." apologized JR, as he looked at Mijo and winked. "Hey JR..!" greeted Urda, as JR waved at Urda back.

"We should go, there's a random large building with a door over there." said Mijo, before he walked to the door as the rest followed.

Back to the light world, in which the class had just finished their quiz. "And that should be all the quizzes, goodbye Pearl!" said Maris, their teacher. "Goodbye, Mam Maris!" said the class as the teacher left. Then Lauvielle went to Leviente as he was clearing his part of the desk.

"Uh.. hey.. you wanna talk about JR, and the others?" asked Lauvielle, as Leviente was done and grabbed his drink and responded, "Sure, what exactly about them?"

"Well, the.. chem lab thing, you know.." said Lauvielle, as Leviente drank and responded, "Hmm, still not sure what happened.. It defies all known understanding of science, but.. the most likely is that.. JR's dead."

"W—what?! No way, no way..! They're not confirmed dead! They didn't even go out of school! Whatever's happening inside the chem lab is where they're at, with JR!" said Lauvielle, as Leviente looks at Lauvielle and responds, "Hm, true. But what we can infer from the current information is limited, we need to go back."

"Now? Didn't you say not until 5? Although, they might be in great danger.." said Lauvielle, as Leviente finished his drink and responded with, "Hm yeah. Especially since the whole huge black hole at the chem lab."

Then Lauvielle noticed Rhida was about to go outside the room, and so Lauvielle dragged her to the conversation.

"H—huh? Ah? What? Why did you bring me here? Lauvielle?" asked Rhida, as she looked at the two. "We're talking about the chem lab issue, do you have anything to add?" responded Lauvielle, as Leviente looks at Lauvielle with his eyebrows raised.

"Uh.. we probably shouldn't talk about this until 5, because.. we really don't and can't do anything about this, until at least we know we have time." said Rhida, as the other two looked at each other and nodded, as Lauvielle said, "Ok, fine. We'll definitely figure it out later, see you Rhida!" said Lauvielle, as Rhida waved back and continued on her way, as the other two changed the topic.

Mijo opened the door as the rest followed behind him, quickly monsters that looked like beakers, tubes, and goggles with eyes. They fought through them as Jamise stayed behind them as JR joined the other two in fighting.

"H—huh? Yeah no.. I don't get it, how do you do it?!? JR has nice magical powers, but.. it looks like he didn't go through a life and death situation?" said Jamise to Mijo, noticeably quieter to avoid the other two listening. But Urda noticed this and eavesdropped secretly.

"Hmm.. I don't know either.. I actually don't know as much about things here as you think I do, but I know a gal and her name is Jomi, but.. she has a black hood on, most of the time. She knows a lot and can probably help us." responded Mijo, as Jamise immediately had a question, "Then.. Asan siya? I—Is there like a.. shop, or a place where she most often resides?"

"Well! We last saw her in the skeleton king palace, this dark world is completely different though.." jumped in Urda, surprising the two a bit. "Whaaat..? So, there's a chance that she's not even here?! Hays..."

Mijo went to JR and asked, "Hey! I have been meaning to ask, how did you get your powers? Like did you spawn with it or did you already have it?" JR then turned Mijo with an unamused face and answered, "Got it." while brandishing the kitchen knife he was holding earlier. "I fell to a place filled with chess figures that.. were hostile. So, I used what I had with me, the knife here and the staff I had to defend myself. Eventually, I was pushed into a corner.. and..."

"You killed them all?" asked Mijo, with a concerned expression before JR nodded and Mijo nodded back so he could get back to Jamise and Urda.

"How is your magic decided? Like, why do you have pistols and swords? A—and—" said Jamise, as Mijo approaches and listens. "Why does he have a big sword?! I don't get it.."

"Oh, uh.. wait. So, like.. you get magic in a do-or-die situation and.. I still don't know with the second one, I guess it could represent what we wanted with magic, like me!" answered Mijo, as Urda added, "Yeah, me too. Maybe it grabs like an essence or soul you have?"

"Mmm.. So, to get magic, you put yourself into the corner to force yourself to.. like get magic from your.. soul?" asked Jamise, as Mijo realized something, "Hmm.. now that I think about it, we don't have a healer.. If we're going to make Jamise be in the front lines.." before Mijo went to JR again.

"Then we need a healer, are you one, JR?" asked Mijo, as JR raised an eyebrow and responded, "No.. but, I haven't tried. Is someone hurt?"

"Well, Jamise.. But.. like try at least. It might be helpful since last time, Jomi was the healer, and I don't know where she is, or if she is even trustworthy.." said Jomi, as JR nodded in agreement.

"Hey! Where's the bad guys? We've been talking for quite a while.." remarked Jamise, before the enemy, test tube monsters appeared. Jamise noticed and tried to attack with her staff but she got overwhelmed and was knocked back as JR harnessing his inner cardiologist, healed Jamise begrudgingly and now she was fine.

"Oh, wow.. salamat JR!" exclaimed Jamise. "Don't die." responded JR, as the rest of the test tube monsters got defeated by combined assault of melee Mijo and ranged Urda. As they stare at the battlefield, Jamise ran towards the others as JR begrudgingly followed Jamiae.

"Ah.. That's didn't work!? Welp, time to try again. Next time, no interference.. Mijo, and Urda!" exclaimed Jamise, as Mijo and Urda nodded happily and they continued moving.

They continue moving until a sparkling star appears near their pathway. They all go near it with a mixed reaction, due to Mijo's experience.

"A star.. so a revival item..? Mijo, do you remember what happened? Do you still have yours?" asked Urda, as Mijo suddenly shows a star on his palm, about the size of the other star.

"Oh, so.. well, I am the—" said Urda before Jamise tried to touch it as Urda stopped her hands. "Hey! It's mine. Jamise, get your own.. You don't even have magic!" continued Urda, as she continues to stop Jamise.

"Fine, fine.. You have magic, you win. I just wanted to see what you would say, haha.." said Jamise, as she stopped her hands and Urda looked at her with an unamused face.

Mijo hides his star and asks, "Urda.. Are you sure you want the star? You know what happened to me last time." as Urda looked at the star, determined. "Yes. I.. understand." answered Urda, as her shaking hands touched the star. She suddenly started to convulse as the pain started to take over her body, the others tried to help her.

"W—what?! That's what happened? How did you even survive that, Mijo?!" said Jamise, as JR added, "Hm. I wonder if it travels through the blood vessels.." as they held Urda in their arms. Eventually the star was absorbed with Urda fainting, at Mijo's arms.

"Mmm.. The pain has subsided.. JR, can you see if there's damage?" asked Mijo, as JR tries to heal Urda. "Hmm. I can feel the damage, but otherwise she's fine." responded JR, as he now learned to check vitals using magic.

"Whew.. Those stars, do they really give a revival option? I mean, what's the limitation?" questioned Jamise, as Urda slowly woke up. "Ugh.. Is.. it done?" asked Urda groggily. The others slowly nodded.

"Good.. I was.. going through a lot." said Urda, as she slowly stood up. "Well.. Let's go then. I.. don't want to talk about it." continued Urda, as Mijo and JR nodded as Jamise didn't but remained silent as they continued to move.

So they moved on to the next area, arriving near a school, where there were a bunch of enemies, that were the usual skeletons and beaker hybrids. The area looked like a garden but had many scraps of metal and wood, it seems that it was being used to create the building next to it, though it was incomplete. As they fight through, Jamise strikes up a conversation:

"Hey, these guys are so easy, where's the real deal? Like bosses or something!?" said Jamise, as she was smashing the skeletons using her staff, as the others slowly killed the other enemies one-by-one. "Well, i don't really know, it depends on what we do and how big the world is but yeah, not much i can say right now…” responded Mijo, as they finished up and headed to the school garden.

"Hey, don't you notice that this place looks like our school? There's even an honrato statue there!" commented JR as Urda added, "Well.. now that I think about it.. I guess we're near something important."

Then the statue started to grow to a big humanoid being, out of itself. It can control little atom-like rocks and has a floating beaker as its main weapon. After growing, it started to attack the group.

"Yooo?! Why are we getting attacked by honrato?" questioned Mijo, as JR added with a bit of sarcasm and concern, "Oh no.. Is this for the multiple times I didn't go to his statue.. and give him my hard-earned 5 pesos..?"

Jamise quickly pushed the others, bringing her to the front and closer to the statue with her shouting, "Kaya 'ko to!" as she failed to dodge the atoms but when the beaker was headed in her direction, her magic appeared and deflected the beaker and fully disintegrated it with a purple blast.

"Wooo!! Let's goooo!!!" celebrated Jamise, before being overwhelmed by the atoms so she had to retreat as the others finally decided to intervene and fight the statue.

"Guys! Nakita niyo yon?! Ang cool~" commented Jamise from the back as JR responded with a serious expression, "Yeah yeah.. Just stay back and keep blasting ok?"

*TO THE LIGHT*

An ESP teacher appeared, named Mam Arcea as the class greeted her. A student was asked to pray before they sat down as the teacher was checking the attendance.

"Hmm, asan si.. Mijo Cala, Urda Aman, Jamise Rira.. and JR Baltesar?" asked Mam Arcea, before Rhida responded, "Um.. may sakit po sila.. so absent po.. Kakauwi lang po nila."

"Mhm.." responded Mam Arcea as she checked her phone and saw that they were excused and that the messages were recent. "Ah.. ok sige.." said Mam Arcea, before she continued her lesson.

"Wait..? Rhida.. Asan si Balts? Akala ko kasama niyo siya noong.. lunch break?" whispered Fexili, another fellow student of the section to Rhida. "Ah, well.. he said that.. sumasakit daw ulo niya kaya umalis siya.." said Rhida, keeping up with the facade as Fexili nodded and focused on the lesson.

**_DARKNESS._**

After a whole lot of fighting, eventually the statue was blasted to the nearby unfinished building behind it, turning them both rubble.

"Yes, YES! I finally did something helpful!" shouted Jamise, as she celebrated. "Nice.. now.. uh.. what?" asked Mijo, as he looked at the others.

"Yeah, now what.. didn't we just kill the manifestation of our school's founder?" responded Urda, as Mijo smirked and said, "Yeah, but the fountain is nowhere to be found." 

"Wait, is he actually dead.. or he's gonna come back for the next boss battle?" asked Urda, as Mijo responded, "I don't know.. we'll just have to find out, since his head is in the building.."

"I never understood not checking if the potentially dangerous individual is still alive or not.. Come on Mijo, let's check!" commented JR, as Mijo responded, "Ok fine. **You** check it, but I will not be surprised if we fight a second phase of it, so I am staying here."

"I'll check!" shouted Jamise, as she went inside the building, seeing the debris from the building and the statue. "Oh, the statue's unharmed! The.. original one." commented Jamise as she looks with awe.

"Let's.. put him in his proper place, at least." said Urda, as Mijo nodded and they headed to Jamise to carry the statue to its original place. They carry it and put it down, as they hear a huge sound of something dragging as a facade of a building opens with a large palace and massive walls around it.

"Riiight there, that's where it should be." said Mijo, as Urda asked, "Alright.. uh so we should probably focus on the huge ass palace that just appeared...?"

"Yes, definitely. Hm, though it might be a trap.. It could lead us to dying, great for me. Not for you." responded JR, with a cold expression. "Well, why don't you just let yourself die to the monsters, huh JR?!" said Jamise, somewhat sarcastically.

"Because.. because.. I realized that I had something else that I wanted to do, besides school! I finally found a way of living! I.. don't have to go home every night, breaking down mentally just so I can force myself to do my PT's.. Just, keep calm and kill some monsters, like those games. But, more real." explained JR, as his expression was more resentful and with a splash of sadness.

"Joke lang, JR.. But, me too! I want to.. disappear from my life.. There are so many assigned works and I heard that it only increases per grade level.. I was.. going to ignore this world and go to the ceremony but, I obviously chose this world." responded JR, with an awkward but somewhat sad expression.

"Uh.. c—can.. I share my problems?" asked Urda, as Mijo smiled and nodded, answering, "Sige lang.. Di pa naman uwian ah.."

A bit of laughter came from the others as Urda started to share, "Ok, so… I have a lot of trouble with anything  related to school, I suck at math, biotech, but i also just.. didn't have any friends and was feeling lonely, until I met you guys… Mijo, you have anything to say?"

"Yeah, thank you, all of you for being here, I mean, y'all probably wouldn't be here if di nabuksan ang dark world.. But, ok lang.. Andito na tayo eh." said Mijo, before Urda added, "Yeah.. I wonder who's opening them anyway.."

"Haha.. We'll need to ask Jomi, but.. I am just so happy to be with you guys today, and hopefully more in the future." continued Mijo, as everyone else collectively said, "Awww.."

"Haha.. But, we should go. Earlier we get out.. hmm.. the.. you know what.. let's just go." said Mijo, as the others looked at each other and nodded in agreement. They walked to the large palace as they entered through the facade, seeing the dark skies surrounding it.

"Woah.. is this.. it?" remarked Urda, as Mijo added, "Guess so.. This is the next destination, and it seems to be another castle, like previously."

"Oh? So Mijo, this is the final boss battle? We can finally leave?!" said Jamise, as she looks at Mijo with a hopeful expression. "Oh, I was starting to enjoy the adventure.." commented JR, with a somewhat disappointed expression.

"Ok, let's do this guys. I think we can overpower anything on our path. Even in the toughest battles, we will win." said Mijo, as he looked at the others with a determined expression.

"Hm, sure Mijo? Not a single doubt in our win?" asked JR, with a smug expression. "Yeah. I'm confident, again.. You guys ready?" responded Mijo, as the others express agreements varying from total trust to nonchalant.

"Good enough. Let's go inside." said Mijo, before they went inside the palace. They were instantly attacked by the so-called *Queen's Guard* that were just armored skeletons and beaker hybrids. After a heavy fight, they finally made it to the throne room.

"Welcome, adventurers.. To the end of your journey." said the unknown queen to the newly-arrived lightners as they approach with confidence. "Uhuh.. Easy enough.. Are you.. hard to beat?" responded Jamise, with a smug grin before JR pulled her back and whispered, "Do you want us to actually die?!"

"Haha... You want more? I was expecting less.. but, sure. I would say yes. But, enough—" said the unknown queen before Mijo interrupted, "Wait! Your introduction, please!"

"Huh? Oh, right. I'm Shley, the queen of Scians-Chemastra, also called the queen of Chemistry.. The kingdom is a merger of two kingdoms, currently managing the skeletons. There, that's my lore, happy lightner?" said Shley with a somewhat amused face. "Oh, alright.. thanks!" said Mijo, with a grin.

Shley immediately struck at Mijo first, surprising him and temporarily putting him out of the battle. Urda followed with a quick gunshot and stab, as JR and Jamise blasted her with snakes and balls of purple. JR immediately went to Mijo to try and heal him, this is the conversation that followed:

"Hey! Mijo, Are you okay?? You're gonna be fine.. Just.. hold on." said JR, as he healed Mijo. "Hah.. I.. never thought that I.. would hear that.. from you.." said Mijo, as he laughed weakly. "Oh shhh.. Mijo." responded JR, with a small smile, before they got back to battling.

As they were fighting Shley, she fired little smoke bombs that concealed her position around them.

"Fuckin— Hey! Come here, coward!!" said Jamise as she blasted through the smoke to try and find Shley. "Jamise!!" shouted Urda, as she teleported back to Jamise, coughing. "Jamise— _cough_ —these smokes are dangerous.. They poison you." said Urda, coughing heavily.
"What?! Oh no, hey? Wait, why did you get poisoned, how does your teleport work anyway?" asked Jamise as Urda looked at her with concern. "Ugh.. Well, since... you know what, I'll explain later. We're in a battle right now." answered Urda, as Jamise notices a projectile about to hit them. "Oh shit—" said Jamise, before she and Urda get blasted by Shley using an on-hit explosive bomb.

The smoke finally dwindled as JR and Mijo finally found the other two. "Oh! You really fucked up big time, Shley!" shouted Mijo as he comes barreling towards Shley. “Nope.” said Shley as she manifests a shield to block his ultimate stab, making Mijo be knocked away to the ground on his feet unfazed but angry. "Dammit, can you pierce her JR?" asked Mijo, as JR fired the largest blast he could muster and it made a dent, but not much on her shield.

He ran to the other two and said as he helped them get up, "Ok so.." as the other two get up with his help and run to JR, whom is distracting Shley with an army of snakes.

"Ok, so uh.. shield, anyone?" asked Mijo, as JR and Urda shaked their respective heads as Jamise starts manifesting her magic. "Let's see.." said Jamise before making a huge forcefield in front of her, enough to protect the four of them. “Niice, Jamise, where did you learn that?” said Urda. "I.. think I discovered it myself!" said Jamise, then she makes the shield larger and then JR starts to focus on the group.

"Ok.. So I have a plan, me and Urda, fight her melee style, draw aggro away from you guys since y'all have better magic damage. Now JR and Jamise, Jamise, try to focus on defense for  as you have a shield, meanwhile JR, focus on attack, like huge damage. A'ight that should be it. Any questions?" said Mijo before Urda asked, "What if we get injured?" 

"We go to JR as Jamise protects us from harm." answered Mijo, as Jamise had another question. "What if I wanna attack too?!?!" questioned Jamise, with a bit of sarcasm. "Well, you do, as long as you protect from any damage because you can defend, JR is less than capable to do so. Sorry JR, discover shield next time!" answered Mijo, as JR chuckled and responded, "It's fine, i prefer damage anyway.. I'll definitely do that though, thanks Mijo." then Mijo asked, "Ok. Anyone else?" before everybody responded with a degree of differing no's.

The battle follows exactly as planned, but then as JR was about to break the shield, Shley opened up walls of fire around her as Urda and Mijo retreated to JR. "Damn, fire walls.." remarked Mijo, as Urda asked, "Uh.. what can we even do..?" as Mijo shrugged his arms. "No wait! Guys! What if I use my shield to punch through those walls of fire then Urda and Mijo quickly follow up with a combined strike!" said Jamise, as everyone lools at her with amazement. "Huh, good idea. Ok let's do it then, but are you sure you can handle the fire?" asked Mijo as Jamise smiled and answered, "I totally can, just focus on **HER."** as Mijo nodded in acknowledgement.

So  Jamise slowly pushed up to the fire with the group until she met the fire and quickly went through the fire, weakening her in the process. "We're through! Just.." exclaimed Jamise before fainting. "Let's not waste this opportunity! Urda, let's go!" shouted Mijo,  before both of them attacked Shley. Shley was surprised by this maneuver as she was easily put down by the two resulting in her defeat.

Ugh, good job, adventurers…” said Shley as she slumped on a wall nearby, with tattered clothes. "HAH! And it was mostly because of magic." said Mijo, as the rest approached her with their weapons pointed at her. "Don't be like this, adventurers.. I am just going to heal—" said Shley before JR said, "**No.**"

"No..? Look, you adventurers win. The fountain is behind that throne. I will let you through and anyone else..." said Shley as Mijo remembered someone. "Hey, where _is_ Jomi?" questioned Mijo as Shley points to a door entrance. "That dungeon." answered Shley as Mijo and Urda both quickly ran to the dungeon. "Urda! Mijo! Ugh.. Ok queen, you better be truthful." said JR, before he put down his weapons and went to Jamise. Shley nodded and said, "I promise."

As JR healed Jamise, and Shley healed herself, Mijo and Urda went to the dungeon door and opened it quite easily as they headed down and saw Jomi trapped in the only cellar there that was not empty. "Oh.. uh, Mijo and Urda! You have come to save me?" said Jomi, as the other two went towards her, looking concerned. "So, you guys might be wondering how I got here? Well.. I arrived shortly after you guys arrived, I know that because I saw you guys go outside of some building and shortly after that I got caught by some of the queen's guards... so I was brought before her and she decided to send me towards the prison for 'trespassing and helping the lightners.' Ugh.." explained Jomi, as the other two looked at each other.

"Oh.. ok. So, they just threw you in here, full clothes and hood on?" commented Mijo on her appearance as Jomi nodded and said, "Just..
let me out please.." as the other two realized that they forgot to ask Shley how to get Jomi out, Jomi easily notices this. "Oh? Um, I think I saw the queen has keys to the cells here so go to her and get me out of here!" said Jomi, as Mijo awkwardly started to walk back up. "Oh ok.. Urda, stay here. I'll just talk to the queen ok?" said Mijo, as Urda nodded before he started to run to get to the queen, going up the stairs out of the dungeon to get to the queen, who was talking to JR and Jamise.

"Ang tagal naman nila.." said JR, as he listened to Jamise and Shley's conversation. "So, what you did to those skeletons was, use them as an army for you?" asked Jamise, as she answered, 'Yeah.. they didn't like it. Makes sense, but we were running out of manpower.."

"Hey Queen—" said Mijo, as the others quickly noticed him. "Hay nako, you're finally here! How do we even get out of here? Where's Urda?" said JR, as Mijo answered, "Oh uh, I.. came up here to grab the Queen's keys to let… a friend out."

"Oh? Yeah, that princess, Jomi? Sure, can you tell her no hard feelings? I.. might have overreacted a bit." said Shley as she gave Mijo the keys. "Uh, yeah.. thanks."  responded Mijo before quickly going back to the dungeon.

"—So.. that's your questions answered." said Jomi, as Urda nodded, happy with Jomi's answers. "Here, I got the keys, hold on." said Mijo before fiddling with the keys to find what key works until the cell opens. "Oh, finally...
Thanks, Mijo." said Jomi, as she got out of the cell, between the other two. "You're welcome, queen said no hard feelings by the way." said Mijo, as Jomi responded, "Ugh, that queen. Ok fine. Esa reina no es muy importante para mí.." said Jomi, as the other two followed her outside the dungeon.

"Woah, wait.. What?! You know Spanish?" asked Mijo as Jomi responded, "Yeah. Don't worry, it's nothing important.. You trust me, don't ya?" with a wink as she continues walking up. "That hood girl is veeery sus right now…" whispered Urda to Mijo. "Uh, yeah i guess, but I agree. She didn't hide anything we didn't already know." whispered back Mijo. "Oh.. then what was it?" whispered Urda again. "Uh.. I think the queen's not important to her?" whispered Mijo back. "Ah, ok ok.. I trust you… Ay! Naiwanan na tayo! Tara!" shouted Urda as both of them followed up with Jomi outside of the dungeon, as Jomi is speaking to Shley, while JR and Jamise were listening.

"Ok… I had reasonable suspicion that you were about to end my reign using the lightners—" responded Shley. "For a good reason?! You know you almost killed them right? And YOU locked me up because of them as well, so I hate you." shouted Jomi, as she was clearly letting her anger show. "Woah, woah.. Sisters.. calm down." said Jamise as the other two finally caught up.

"Whew.. we can finally get out.." said Mijo, as Shley responded to Jomi, "Hey, Jomi. You wanna settle this beef? Let's have a chess game right.. **here.** Just say the word, and I will summon the chess board here." as the others except Jomi were shocked with her usage of words. "Ugh, hold that thought, Mijo, I have to win against this tangina..." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and the others remained silent, questioning what Shley just said as she put a chess board down. "Well, the deal's done. Here!" said Shley as she does so.

"Don't worry, Jomi. I thought of the rules, normal chess, no timers and a.. coin flip to see the color. I'll let someone else do it." continued Shley as she summons a coin that looks like a peso from the Philippines. "Hmm, Urda? Why don't you do it?" said Shley as Urda nodded and went closer to Shley. "Hmph. I pick heads." said Jomi, as Urda was urged by Shley to start as Urda flips the coin, it landed on heads!

"Well, alright then. I play well in both colors anyway. Ha, you might only play well at white, Jomi…" remarked Shley as Jomi responded, "We'll see about tha— wait…" as Shley chuckled and nudged Jomi to start. "Ok, alright.. Let's do this." said Jomi as they started. As they played, the others took sides. Mijo and JR were on Jomi's side and Urda and Jamise were on Shley's. The game started with massive blunders, misses and questionable moves all the way until…

"Hmm.. oh. Knight moves to g8, check." muttered Jomi, as Shley moves her king to e8. "Mmm.. there." said Shley with a poker face. "Hm, castle queen's side." said Jomi, as Shley responds with, "Queen takes G2....". Jomi's eyes lighten up before she said, "Aha! Rook takes d6." as Shley's face switches to being more worried. "Ah, bollocks. Better hope that she doesn't notice the mate in 11." thought Shley as Jomi noticed her reaction and reacted with a grin. "Hum... King to e8.." said Shley as Jomi responds, "Hah. Queen moves to e7, checkmate." Shley checked the board and remarked, "Huh. Good game, Jomi." as Jomi responds with a friendly smile, "Hah, yeah.. i guess, you too."

“Well, that's it! After an hour! We can go home!” said Mijo, as Urda added, "After all of that, i still don't understand chess…" then Mijo responds, "Don't worry, I'll teach you then." before he winked. "Uyyy, may move na si Mijo!!" commented Jamise as Urda interrupts, "Shut up, Jamise.. But sure, if we can find time.."

"I permit you adventurers, and Jomi, to go home. I have to clean up the throne room anyway." said Shley, as the others headed to the fountain. "Wait. Mmm.. I think it's time I.. take off this hoodie of mine, trust me, It'll make sense in the future." said Jomi, as the others look at her with great interest. "Oooh.. I wish to know, too.." remarked Shley, as the others turned back to look at Jomi. "Ok, here I go." said Jomi, before she took off her hoodie, revealing a teenage-looking tall girl with a witch hat and glasses, as well as hair on both of her shoulders, as well as the general look being similar to a certain Mijo, the rest was covered up with the black hoodie.

"What… the.." said Mijo first, before Jomi quickly put the hoodie back on and said, "Haha.. I see you all have mixed reactions.. I will explain in the future later, let's close this fountain first." so they silently went to the fountain behind the throne again and saw the huge geyser filling the sky with darkness.

"You know what, Mijo? How about I do it?" said Urda, as they approached the fountain. "Oh, sure.." responded Mijo, as they stopped nearby the fountain and Urda started to close the fountain. "Hey, Shley and Jomi! Hopefully you guys don't fight!" said Mijo, as the two chuckled. "Oh, don't worry adventurer, the paperwork will bore her so much she will be so apathetic towards me." responded Shley, as Jomi crossed her arms and added, "True. You're lucky."

"Ok let's do this." said Mijo as Urda materializes her heart then raises it to the fountain. Music played again, and then light took over as the lightners woke up in the chemistry laboratory on the tables, like they were dreaming, again.

"Ugh, ah shit.." said JR as he 'woke' up from seemingly sleeping. "Oh! Damn you scared me, JR!" responded Jamise as she 'woke' up too. Both Mijo and Urda woke up at the same time but they didn't say anything. "So, uh what are you doing in the chemlab JR?" asked Jamise, as JR answered, "Uh, I was trying to find you guys, strangely enough, everything seems fine here.."

Urda speaks up, "That's because.. you were in what's called, a _dark world._" as Mijo adds, "Yeah, and If you think it's a dream, it's not. Though everything that we can do there doesn't apply up here.. I think, anyway."

"Wait, **WHAT?!** Everything that happened there actually happened like... You guys know who Shley is and that.. hooded girl?" asked JR as Urda answered, "Yeah! Also that girl's name is Jomi. You didn't hear?" then Jamise adds, "This opens up so many possibilities..! Wait.. what time is it?" before the two of them check their phones and see it is 5:30 PM (17:30).

"Shit! It's 5:30 PM?!?" said RJ, as he quickly got his things, checking everything he could in the lowest possible time. "Oh, practice..? Well, I am going anyway, see you Mijo!" responds JR looking at his messages, seeing that he was conveniently excused for some practice that supposedly happened. Then JR rushed out, as Jamise only began to look for her bags. "Oh, they're there." remarks Jamise after she spent a really long time looking around her.

"Hm, we didn't bring our bags with us.. They must have brought it here, JR and the others, I mean." said Mijo, as Jamise picks up her bags and responds, "Yeah. Well, I'm going out, I have a long commute. See ya two lov—" before she intentionally cut herself off and quickly fled the scene. The two are silent for a while as they get their things, until Mijo decides to break the silence.

"Hey.. uh.. don't you have a long way to go from here?" said Mijo, remembering a detail about her home, very far from the school and city, but she can somehow manage. "Yeah, that's.. true. Imma go now, um.. I'll message you later if I am up, bye!" responds Urda, as she leaves in a hushed hurry.

"Uh.. well ok.. Hmm.. everything here seems fine, I better go though, if I stay too long here, I might be seen.." muttered Mijo as he walks out of the chemistry lab and closes the door. "Woah, wait, isn't it usually closing time? Oh well, I'll just trust that the magic in the dark world works here or... yeah I should go now." said Mijo as he goes out of the hallway near the rooms and goes home.

He opens his phone after eating dinner and chats with Urda on his phone, laying down on his bed.

Mijo: Hey i have an idea

Urda: ok

Mijo: So we make a GC to compile the latest dark world shenanigans as after today uh its getting out of our control so we make one and invite Jamise and JR there. To secretly speak bout the dark world.

Urda: cool, do it

Mijo: Yeah on it, we'll continue there ok?

Urda: 👍

So he makes the new GC called the “dark world for lightners” and invites Urda, JR and Jamise.

Urda: 👍

JR: oh new gc for this huh @Mijo

Jamise: Oh nice I didn't remember to make one but you beat me to it @Mijo

Mijo: Yeah, i know so this is just where any general thing related to the dark world is posted so everyone knows atleast by the day so uh good night everyone! Reactions: ♥️3

He closes his phone and goes to his computer room and studies for the next day, as school marches forward and he isn't going to be left behind.

“Alright, another day, another dark world. Let's see what happens in the next one. Good luck to all who will and have participated. I.. uh, better study now.” said Mijo to himself as he picked up a notebook.

## Author's Note:

YEAH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ITS ALL ABOUT WOOOOO!

Anyways, after 3 months, I've completed the rewrite of C2. It's finally canon again!! (haha...) Combining this with the old draft, it's been 7 months of occasional work to finally have proper hooks to my beloved novel.

Again, the chess games are based on real ones that i recorded so there's some accuracy there. I made up some names to not obviously reference something, but chess is an exception. Anywho, this is the end of the 2 chapter rewrite for Chapter 3 continuation so, hopefully I'll see you at the end of chapter 3, bye!

## Summary:

A winter morning brews upon a new dark fountain, Mijo and his friends explore this winter landscape in hopes of adventure, friendship and to make new paths.

## Author's Note:

HOLY HECK JMB ISN'T GOING TO BE STUCK WRITING CHAPTER 3 ANYMORE?! 

yeah.. um, so after I analyzed it with help from.. stuff, I realized that I should revamp it and finally decided to fully rewrite the whole thing. If I'm going to be out of (high) school in 2 months, I might as well just start now and finish season 1 (yes, I'm that ambitious) but don't get ahead of yourself, I'd take a while. For now, just sit back and enjoy **DRAFT 2** of 'Into the Dark'!

oh btw, I only ever put dates, timestamps and emojis when I'm actually done (this is to clarify draft stuff)

edit 1: some cyrillic will be used, so you'll have to make sure you can have them and have a translator, if I don't explain something.

_Ring..! Ring..!_

"Shut.. up.." said Mijo groggily as he turns off the alarm, he doesn't know why he's still using that dreaded morning themed sound, but he has been quite busy the past few days.. "Damn.. I need to go to school now..! I'll be late..!" Mijo then quickly rushed to do his daily routine, then went to school.

Mijo is panting as he rushes into the classroom, and sits on a chair. Mijo calmed himself down before settling in and putting his things down as he saw JR. "¡Hola! What's.. what's the.. talk?" asked Mijo, before JR looked at him like he just woke up. "And **dark world.** Mijo." answered JR, with a serious tone. "Ay! Um.. what about it?" questioned Mijo, as JR looked around for a bit before looking at Mijo's eyes intensely.

"Earlier.. when I was half-asleep.. there was a loud explosion towards.. like the grade 7 building.." answered JR, now looking concerned. "Oh. Um, why didn't you tell in the GC?" asked Mijo, as JR put his hand on Mijo's shoulder. "Jamise. She's always been.. reckless. Sometimes even.. dumb. I don't want her to go to that dark world, without you. I'm not sure if Urda is strong enough to deny Jamise or protect her, I **need** you." explained JR, as Mijo thought about the situation.

"Guess so.. do you think she can keep it a secret then?" asked Mijo, as JR shook his head. "I don't think so. Let's just hope and pray she's not dumb enough to do **that."** answered JR before the two hear the classroom door open. They saw Urda and Jamise with Urda carrying her bag as Jamise was earlier but wanted to pick Urda up. "That's them. Quick, before ma'am arrives." said Mijo, before Mijo and JR stood up and met with the two.

"Ganon ba..? Girl~ Kausapin mo siya—" said Jamise off-handedly as the two arrived at their position. "Heey.. **dark world."** said Mijo, which surprised the two, with Jamise smiling and Urda looking away with a faint blush. "Ay, speaking of the anghel, ano na?" asked Jamise, as she looked at Mijo excitedly. 

Then the teacher arrived, forcing them to break off and sit down. "JR. Let's meet them again at recess..?" asked Mijo, as JR nodded and then they focused on the teacher.

_Meanwhile.. Leviente and Lauvielle were outside, talking when they stumbled onto something.._

"So.. ganon..?" asked Lauvielle, looking disappointed at Leviente. "Yep. Kasi—"  answered Leviente before seeing a classroom near them that has two separate doors open but is dark, way too dark inside. "Huh? Oh. That room is.. too dark. Huh, I think—" said Lauvielle, before Leviente interrupted, "Hm. It appears we have encountered.. a dark place. Come, Lauv. Let's enter it!" Before jumping in, without even holding Lauvielle's hand.

"Hey..! WAIT!" shouted Lauvielle before she looked at the darkness of the whole room, she couldn't see where Leviente was, it was too dark. "I.. might as well, I'm late anyway.. Nawala na din siya, eh.." said Lauvielle to herself before also jumping in as the doors closed.

_Meanwhile, at class, as JR and Mijo are not listening to the discussion.._

"Hey.. you wonder where Lev and Lauv are?" asked Mijo, as JR nodded. "I don't know.. but they might've just been the first ones in that new dark world." answered JR, as Mijo widened his eyes and said more loudly, "What?! Yo, what if they.. encounter super hard difficult bosses, and we're not there yet?" Before JR could answer, Rhida said to them both, "Hey guys.. Sir has an activity for us."

"Oh, then Mijo, let's worry about them later. I'm sure they'll awaken their elemental power soon enough anyway." said JR, before dragging Mijo to Rhida to do the class activity.

_Into the Darkness, a wintery landscape is seen around the duo.._

"Ugh.. hey wait I'm not dead..!" said Lauvielle as she popped up, dusting off her now dark blue suit-like outfit with shorts and a vest. "Huh?! What's this?!" She looks at herself, adorned with a completely different outfit from what she was used to. "Apparently.. something that makes you even more beautiful~" said Leviente, wearing a red jacket, with a dark blue undershirt and pants, and a black leather belt. Lauvielle slightly blushes as she eyed Leviente's look. "Sh—shut up.. You're.. handsome too, y'know." blurted out Lauvielle, as Leviente smiled.

"Aww.. is lola getting sweet..?" said Leviente before Lauvielle slapped him in his arm. "Ahem.. ahem..! Asan tayo pala?" asked Lauvielle as she looked around the cold wintery area, with some snow fall. "I don't know, lola. It seems we have entered a completely different world.." Leviente trailed off as he saw Lauvielle shivering. "S—so cold.. my legs.. damn.. why is this.. my.." said Lauvielle as Leviente pulled out some pants out of his pocket and gave it to Lauvielle.

"W—what?! What?!" said Lauvielle as she puts the pants over her shorts. "There's an inventory system.. like, check the pockets of those pants now." explained Leviente as Lauvielle, digging into her pants to see an inventory menu, she apparently had a comically large toy hammer and some spare change. "Is that... all I have?" asked Lauvielle as Leviente answered immediately, "I don't know. I can't see your inventory too y'know." 

"Oh.. um.. well I have a.. toy hammer.. and some.. like.. 5 peso coins.. around 25 in total. I'm not even sure if I can use 'em." said Lauvielle as Leviente chuckled. "I had extra pants, an unknown red orb, and.. some boxed pizza!" Leviente showed them each, pointing to the pants worn by Lauvielle, then holding a red orb then some pizza box. "I..! Whatever! Let's go..! go.. Where are we anyway?" asked Lauvielle as they looked around the wintery landscape again.

"I.. don't know. Let's stay cautious, there might be—" Leviente stops himself when he sees a figure in the distance with a hood over their head. "Oh no.. they look threatening..! Um, we.. I.. we're fucked..! Quick, I'll run away while you—" said Lauvielle before Leviente held her arm, preventing her from running as the figure approached them. "H—hello..! I'm.. Jomi. The Princess of the Dark. Don't be scared, here..!" Jomi takes off her hoodie and reveals her face, white long hair tied up in a bun, with a tiara on her head. 

"Mijo..?" Leviente asks as Lauvielle nods in agreement. "Ah!? Yes.. Umm.. Mijo? I know him, don't worry.. We.. we.. just look familiar." answered Jomi as she moved closer, the two noticed how she gripped her sheathed sword tightly. "You know.. okay, that.. makes sense, now wonder.. so.. how was it? What did you do with Mijo?" asked Lauvielle, as Jomi smiled and held both of their hands. "I'll.. tell you as we go, I have a.. place we can stay at."

_Back to the Light, the group is worried about the duo.._

"Finally..! Done na yung quiz..!" exclaimed JR as he looked at Mijo. "Yep. Finally, what did you get for—" asked Mijo before being interrupted by Jamise. "HEY GUYS!!" shouted Jamise, strutting to the two, as Urda joined. "hey.. guys..!" said Urda softly. "So, obvious na wala sina Lev at Lauv, pero we know na isa lang ang pinaka obvious na they went to." said Jamise, as JR nodded. "The **dark world** at the grade 7 building. Let's go." said JR, as he started to go out of the classroom as the others followed.

_As they went out of the classroom, a certain girl and her friend group were curious why.._

"Girlie~ Look! Mijo is going out, let's follow him!" said Mack as Rhida blushed. "W—what!? That'll make us look like stalkers.. I don't want.. **that!"** blurted out Rhida, as Fexili responded, "Is it different from how you stalk him at school?" 

"H—hey! It's not stalking.. Just.. coincidental meetings, yeah." responded Rhida, as Mack patted her back. "Come on, you two..! Before Rhida here misses out on Mijo." said Mack as he stood up then the other two followed.

_The three followed the four from the classroom of 8-Pearl to the 8-Ruby classroom..._

As Rhida and her group followed Mijo and his group, they stopped at some classroom with it's doors closed. Then Mijo opened the classroom, as some black smoke was spewing out of it, it seemed to be fully dark inside. Then, the group looked at each other before jumping in one by one, JR first, Jamise second, Urda third and before Mijo jumped, he looked around and saw Rhida and her group as they approached hesitantly.

"O—oh? Rhida, Mack and Fexili? Um.. I don't think you three should be here.. But.. I don't have time to explain, I have to go now, ¡Adiós!" said Mijo, before he also jumped in. "No!! Wait..!" exclaimed Rhida before she slipped down the darkness. "Rhida!" said Mack as he tried to grab Rhida but also got pulled down. Fexili tried to grab Mack too, but they all got dragged down with her to the dark abyss below.

_Into the Dark once more, a girl lands alone.._

"Ugh.. h—huh?! Where am I..?" Rhida looks around her, a wintery landscape that somehow feels.. right for her even though it's cold. "And.. my dress..? Odd.. Like.. an ice princess..? Elsa?" commented Rhida, as she looked at her outfit. A long white dress with a hood and ample sleeves. "Um.. interesting.. But I gotta go.. to.. um.. not freeze to death.." said Rhida, before she started to walk forward.

"Bzzz.. Why.. did I fall into.. a winter.. place.." muttered Rhida, as she stepped one by one using her new light blue heels. "A—and heels..? In.. in.. sub-zero temperature.. don't even have socks.. this.. sucks.." continued Rhida, before seeing a small glimmer of a small cabin, clearly insulated inside. "T—thank g—god.. please.. whoever's inside.. help me.." commented Rhida, as she approached the cabin then knocked on the door.

"Who goes there?" Jomi opens the door, clutching her sword at the hilt, while keeping it sheathed. "Ah?! Please.. you have to.. huh..?" said Rhida, as she looked at Jomi, she was about to beg this random person to let her in, but then her face brought back her memories of Mijo, for some odd reason. "What..? Oh..! Sorry, I'm just.. very on-edge.. due to the situation, come on in.. New Lightner!" said Jomi, before letting Rhida inside in the much-needed warm room.

"Oh? Rhida!" greeted Lauvielle, as Leviente waved at Rhida, still reeling from Jomi and the cold. "O—oh..? Lauvielle.. Leviente..? Your looks.. look completely different.." trailed off Rhida as the two look at each other and nod. "Of course! Jomi here told us that we are at like.. a magical fantasy world or something and that we all have our own unique outfits we get from our magic or something.. Though, she said we haven't unlocked ours..?" explained Lauvielle as Leviente added, "She's simplifying here.. and there's most likely a bit more than what the intro is by that princess."

"Oh.. that's.. okay.. I guess.. but, like.. I s—saw my friends.. and Mijo jump into this dark area.. Uh, since I'm here.. they must be somewhere else?" asked Rhida, as Jomi, who was listening quietly, spoke up. "Oh? Then we must find them, quick. They might have landed somewhere else, or.. nevermind. Let's go!" said Jomi, as the others nodded and followed Jomi out of the cabin, as Jomi closed the cabin they were at.

Jomi guided the three, though the other three were less than suited to the cold, Jomi seemed persistent in her dark blue coat, covering a small glimmer of a purple dress and big purple witch hat containing her hair. Noticeably, her hair is white while using a pink bowtie as the hair tie. They walked through what seems to be endless snow and rock until Jomi stopped, and the rest of them stopped as well.

"Avanti!" shouted Mijo, as he suddenly showed up with a sword and clashed with Jomi's. "Mijo?!" said the four as Jomi deflected the two of them away from each other. Jomi is hiding a bit of surprise and panic as Mijo sheathes his sword, small blue lightning around his sheath. "Oh. Jomi? And.. Lev.. Lauv.. Rhida..!" said Mijo, as he looked at the four and chuckled a bit. "Well.. I guess I am a bit **too** paranoid. I was wondering where you were, Jomi.." said Mijo to Jomi, as she calmed herself down.

"You too.. I.. was just.. looking for you actually.. and your friends too.." said Jomi, as she looked behind Mijo to see familiar faces, like JR with his big wooden 'holy' staff, Jamise with a similar wooden staff but more blue and flowy, and finally, Urda, holding a pistol at the holster as she looks at the group. "Oh? Yeah it's just us.. Speaking of which, where's.. um.. Mack and Fexili?" asked Mijo, before they heard some commotion to the left of them, as flashes of blue, purple and yellow appeared.

"Agh. Of course, someone's gotta ruin the reunion. Don't worry, I got.." said Mijo, before a person wielding a scythe appeared in his view, on what seems to be time slowing down, he quickly clashed with her, sending her back. As her partner, a girl with a huge gun had Mack and Fexili behind them with guards appearing to be detaining them. "Hey! What?! You can't just.. detain my friends! You have to at least—" said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted him. "I.. got this."

"I'm Princess Jomi of the Castle, El Reino de Oscuridad. I.. demand you release these two lightners. They're with **me**. They're my **entourage**. If this case has been ordered by the _Supreme Guardian_, I shall negotiate with her directly." said Jomi authoritatively, as the girls she's speaking to, look at each other then at her, before whispering to each other. "I bring no harm to the city. Only that I have the help that she requires. If you do not trust my statement, make _her_ appear." continued Jomi, as the two finished whispering and were about to say something before the Supreme Guardian appeared behind them.

"Welcome.. welcome. I'm Svetlana. _Supreme Guardian of Dajovy_. These are my subordinates.. Sasha—" Svetlana points to the scythe girl. "The Marshal of the Silver Guards. And.. Anastasia, my heir apparent, as well as my right hand.." Svetlana points to the girl holding the gun. "Let's.. put aside the pleasantries, dear princess. I know what you're here for. Now, why don't we go back to the city? Oh, and Sasha? Release them." said Svetlana, as Sasha nodded and let go of Mack and Fexili, they both go to Rhida.

Mack was wearing a somewhat flamboyant red outfit covering his whole body, while Fexili was wearing more reserved light blue pants and shirt, with a dark blue vest over his shirt. "Rhida! We don't know how.. or what happened but we landed at this random space, then as we got up and walked, we met Mijo and his group but then these.. guards arrived or something, we were so outmatched! Um.. though.. I thought I felt something in my hands, some handle or sorts? Before we got knocked back.." explained Mack to Rhida, while the others listened. "I think that was a halberd. I had one too. But it disappeared when we got knocked back." added Mack as Mijo narrowed his eyes.

"Guys." Jomi says to everyone as the others notice Svetlana and her group leave them alone. "We are going to meet her, but I requested some time to.. plan and think." explained Jomi, as everyone nodded and they gathered into a circle of sorts. "Okay cool.. Then let's just like.. communicate and figure out what just happened." said Mijo, as he looks at Rhida unconsciously before focusing on Lauvielle. "Lauv, tell me what happened on your side." said Mijo, as Lauvielle nodded and looked at Leviente and Rhida, to prepare herself.

"Um.. we arrived here by that dark room stuff. We were walking around in the cold before Jomi found us, then as we were chatting in a cabin, Rhida found us. Then Jomi led us out, then we met you!" explained Lauvielle as Jomi looks at Mijo, as Mijo nods in what Jomi wants him to say. "Okay, well we jumped into this dark world, some random gate of.. I don't remember, then we walked and walked, it was all cold aside from those ruins. Then as we saw some figures on the distance, we ran to them, since they looked human. But before we could try and talk to them, they got jumped by those guards, we were also distracted by some of 'em, but as we chased off the others, you four arrived." explained Mijo, then the other two, Mack and Fexili then explained their story to the others.

"Alright.. alright.. I see." said Jomi, as she looked around her looking serious. "All of you went through the same portal.. But, arrived at different times, resulting in different locations.. Then, if you didn't meet me, you met the Dajovy residents.. Okay, just.. follow me. The thing is within these worlds, you just.. need to experience it to learn. Mijo and the others can vouch for that." continued Jomi, as Mijo and others agreed and nodded. "Mhm. Be vigilant. Just, don't trust anyone that isn't Jomi, 'kay?" added Mijo, as he looked at Jomi to continue. "I.. um.. yeah. Let's go meet them, follow me." responded Jomi, as they moved to follow the Dajovy Silver Guards.

Urda came close to Mijo, and tapped on his shoulder as he turned around and whispered, "What..?" asked Mijo, as Urda, still slightly blushing said, "Hey, so.. I have an idea for our.. new group name.. since we're so many now.. Um.. it's the 'Dark Pearl'.. I think it sounds.. good." said Urda, as Mizo nodded and smirked. "Hm. 'Kay. I'll tell it to Jomi, but that is just from a certain Caribbean pirate movie, yes?" asked Mijo, as Urda nodded and went away, as Mijo turned to tap Jomi on the shoulder, surprisingly, it felt cold to touch her for some reason.

"Ah..? Mijo..? What.. what do you want?" asked Jomi, as Mijo whispered to her, "Group name, from Urda, we're calling our group the 'Dark Pearl' start using that, I'd think they'd just accept it and move on.." Jomi nodded before her eyes suddenly widened. "Watch out!" shouted Jomi as she clashed with an unknown abyss monster general behind Mijo. The general laughs as he uses his dark magic to hurt Jomi. "Agh!!" screamed Jomi, before Mijo intervened, blue electric flashes as he cuts the general. But then more abyss monsters come in and catch Mijo, with a scythe, making him fall and be surrounded as JR, Urda and Jamise notice and try to follow-up.

"We're surrounded! Where the hell are these guards.. They suck!" shouted JR as he fought the monsters with his staff and knife when they got too close. Urda silently supports as gusts of air flow through her pistols, though the monsters don't even get close because of Jamise, she has a forcefield that protects the front of them while blasting pressurized water. The others hide behind the fighters, but Rhida feels extremely helpless as she sees Mijo and Jomi struggle to get out of the hold of the monsters, Jomi literally crying as the general does whatever dark magic is making her vulnerable to attacks, while Mijo keeps being attacked while killing monsters, exhausting his lightning speed attacks.

"Jomi!! Bastard..!!" shouted Mijo as he teleported away to the group and started charging his massive ultimate judgement cut. Though, the others try to protect him, they are surrounded and Mijo is taking much longer than he anticipated due to his earlier exhaustion. Then, as Jamise moved to protect the group from a large barrage of projectiles, the general got behind the forcefield and was about to take out Mijo, but Rhida who was focused mainly at Mijo, noticed and was about to stop him. "NO!!" she screamed as the general's sword cut. 

**_BLIZZARD STORM._**

In the blink of an eye, the general and his monsters were frozen immediately as Rhida was floating and had snow fall near her. Rhida was clearly wounded on her arm, only covered up by ice. "You shall die." said Mijo, as he finished his judgement cut, finishing the frozen monsters to bits, and as he finished, most of the monsters shattered while the other fighters took care of the rest of the frozen. Rhida then suddenly faints as Mijo catches her in the air before teleporting below, horrified to see her cut in her arm, but a bit relieved she unlocked her own powers.

Jomi appeared, a bit disheveled and with dried up tears, but she looks more concerned for the group than what she just went through. "What happened..?!" she questioned, as Mijo looked at her and Rhida. "She's.. injured.. like.. m— nevermind. I can heal her, just.. hold her close to me, okay?" said Jomi, as she kneeled in the snow and started healing Rhida with her magic, her hand glowing green. The others gather around and watch. "What about you.. Jomi? Aren't you hurt by these.. monsters?" asked Mijo, as he saw Jomi tense up a bit before seemingly forcing herself to relax as she said, "I'm fine.. Just.. minor damages.. Don't worry." 

After a while, Rhida finally wakes up, as Jomi breathes a sigh of relief. "Mijo..?" muttered Rhida, looking at the closest two faces, Mijo and Jomi. "She's awake.. we should move on, and get to the city. Before more arrive. The guards don't have any true power outside of the city, I'd know." explained Jomi, as Mijo, Mack and JR helped Rhida up. Mijo then saw Jomi start to walk, trembling, he doesn't think it's because of the cold though. Mijo and the others follow her, while Rhida leans on Mijo, the others watch her, just in case.

"Mijo.." said Rhida weakly, as Mijo looks at her, concerned. "What.. is it? Don't worry, just a few more steps.." responded Mijo, as they continued walking in the cold blizzard. "No.. it's not that.. I..." said Rhida, as she blushed and tugged Mijo to stop walking for a minute. "Hm?" exclaimed Mijo before he slowed down as the others passed by him, though notably Urda and Mack looked interested but continued walking for the sake of the two's privacy.

"I.. love you.. Mijo." said Rhida, as she kissed Mijo, making him flustered for the first time in a while, before Rhida pulled back, still leaning on him. "T—that's.. okay.." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at him very deeply, like she was waiting for his response. "Rhida.. I.." trailed off Mijo, as he allowed his sense of self to be regained for a minute. "I.. love you too." said Mijo, as he was unexpectedly hugged tightly by her, as tight as a weakened Rhida can, anyway. "T—thank you.. so much.." murmured Rhida, as she put her face close to Mijo.

They hugged for a while before Mijo started following the others, while Rhida kept leaning on him. The Dark Pearl finally arrives at the city of Dajovy, as Silver Guards greet them, and Sasha is also there, waiting for them.

"Hello Princess Jomi's Entourage, I'm Sasha. You.. know about this. Apologize for that earlier confrontation, abyss monsters tend to disguise as people nowadays.. Anyways, I'm here to guide you to the Supreme Guardian, in Goieth's Fort. Goieth is.. uh.. a revered name for an unknown hero who helped the architects build the city through their massive contribution in the war against the abyss. They are also known as the Mountaineer, for their great many expeditions on mountains.. Though, we only have one of their many pillars, as the rest are in the eternal freeze." explained Sasha, as the Dark Pearl moved to Goieth's Fort. Mijo and Jomi are quite interested, but the rest are ignoring her and just following, or talking to each other.

"Oh, here we are. I'll.. be outside. This matter is between you and the supreme guardian." said Sasha as they reached the door to the inside. "Okay, thank you, marshal." said Jomi, before they went inside the Fort and met Svetlana after climbing stairs.

"That's.. wasteful..! Meaningless.." said Anastasia to Svetlana before Svetlana said to her, noticing Jomi. "Anastasia, you may leave. Jomi and her lightners are here." said Svetlana, as Anastasia looked at her with some sense of disdain and confusion, before looking at the group then looking at Svetlana before saying, "Yes. Mother." then leaving.

"I'm here. Svetlana. You know my demands. I have to close the dark fountain here, and remove any.. abyss corruption." said Jomi firmly, though Mijo felt Jomi falter on saying the last part for some reason. Some of them also saw Svetlana try to form a smile before turning her face serious again. "I see, princess. Tell me, then what is your plan?" asked Svetlana, as Jomi steadied herself. "Ahem. So, me, JR, Rhida, Mack and Fexili are going with you to the fountain, close it, and fight any abyss monsters trying to stop us. Though, to help you with.. the other front, I'll send Mijo and the rest to the underground, do you agree?" explained Jomi, the rest of the group was completely unaware of this but let it happen, though some, notably Rhida hitched her breath when she heard this.

"Good plan. I agree. Although you might know our situation, you don't know where the place of conflict is, yes? So, I'll directly guide you to the fountain, it is far but walkable. The underground will be managed by Sasha. Do you agree with this, princess?" asked Svetlana as Jomi nodded. "Y—yes. I agree. Let's go whenever." said Jomi, as Svetlana gestured to Jomi's group to follow her. Jomi and her group hesitantly followed. "Jomi.. are you sure about this? Might be a trap, like other worlds.." whispered JR to Jomi, as Jomi trembled and nodded. "I'm.. sure we can handle it if that is the case. Don't worry, this.. this will work, even if that.. the.. supreme guardian isn't.. on our side." whispered back Jomi, before they continued to walk.

Mijo and his group decide to walk outside and find Sasha who is already talking to a Silver Guard. "Seriously..? Fine." said Sasha to the guard before he left as she then put on a more neutral face to the lightners. "Hey, guess you'll be with me. Let's go, then. I know where y'a— I mean, your group is going. It's.. the underground, through the subways." said Sasha before walking with Mijo's group to the subways.

"Hey, so.. what's your situation with.. the supreme guardian anyway? Or uh.. what happened to the underground..?" asked Mijo, as Sasha tensed up. "It's nothing.. lightner. It's just.. military stuff. But as for the underground.. it's.. a contentious topic. We are about to enter rebel territory, I guess.. Keep your eyes peeled." said Sasha as she got her scythe ready, and the others became more aware of their surroundings, they go down to the underground subways.

Suddenly smoke bombs appear, as the group is surrounded by unknown armed men. "St— stay ba—" said Sasha before being knocked out by a woman with a grenade launcher, though she just covered her mouth. "What's happening.." said Mijo, the smoke covering and ensnaring them in unconsciousness. "Urda..?" muttered Mijo, as he sees the figure of Urda look at him before they fell to the ground.

_To the underground.._

Mijo groggily wakes up disoriented as he hears an argument nearby and attempts to listen without disturbing them;

"W—what was that for?! I was.. I didn't need you to smoke me down like that!! I was going to guide them to you, a—and besides, Svetlana is busy! She wouldn't see me do anything, in fact that's why they're here!" said what sounds like Sasha to an unknown woman, though she looks familiar, somehow. "Calm down. We haven't communicated in a while since the blockade. So, I didn't know if you were followed, or if you were a bait. We did the safe option.. besides, the smoke is non-lethal..! Hmmm.. I haven't checked though, but.. hey, look! That guy's awake." said the unknown woman, as Mijo jumped up.

"Ah?! Sorry. I was just interested, mmm.. Anyways! Who.. are you, and yeah, explain." said Mijo, as Sasha looked at the unknown woman, and she politely nodded. "I'm Natascha, town doctor. You might recognize me, but be rest assured, I'm now here to help you." said Natascha, as Mijo looked more clearly, she looks like the figure from earlier, and the grenade launcher on top of the boxes looked similar.

"Ugh. She's right. You know me. Sasha. Marshal. Well.. 11-6 I'm from the underground, and.. I was actually heavily arguing with Svetlana over this whole blockade, but well.. good solidiers follow orders! Ahem. I'm a little heated right now, so y'all deal with it." added Sasha, as she calmed herself down. "Yes, I was.. not surprised she was angry. But, apparently.. I've heard from your friends, she's quite... polite." responded Natascha as Sasha looked away and is flustered. "Okay..! Jeez.. I know! You don't gotta spread it around.." said Sasha as Natascha turned to Mijo.

"Your friends are already out in the town. But, as for they went.. Sasha. You know what to do~" said Natascha as Sasha sighed and picked up her scythe. "Oh, where's.. my room? My old one I mean. I.. don't think I can walk around as a silver guard.." asked Sasha, more calm as Natascha pointed her to a door. "It became the supply closet since the blockade. But, I think your stuff's still there, at least.. the ones that weren't taken.. like.. the mattress, some spare duplicates.. and oh, your old desk has been turned into my table. Abyss monsters destroyed mine when we fully moved here." said Natascha as Sasha nodded.

"Right. Last I heard, you were stealing my table.. whatever. I know what you mean.." replied Sasha as she turned to Mijo. "Your name's Mijo right? Svetlana told me about it. Apparently, she had a list of your entourage.. If she was expecting you, then that makes sense.. Anyways, stay there!" said Sasha before she booked it inside the room.

_At the fountain.._

"JR!! RHIDA! GET OUT!" shouted Jomi, as she is trapped in abyss magic by Svetlana. "Huh, as she planned.." murmured Svetlana as she looks at the others, JR holding out his staff and Rhida hiding behind him, while Mack and Fexili are beside, since they're trapped by some unknown invisible barrier. "We can't! Jomi, there has to be some insane move you can pull off, like what Mijo said!" said JR, as Jomi felt herself being torn inside-out.

"I can't.." said Jomi, as she looks at Svetlana almost pleadingly. "Oh? Don't worry about it. But, as for them..?" said Svetlana, as she used abyss magic to blast projectiles that are parried by JR's shield wall. "Haha.. let me just.." said Svetlana, as she blasted abyss magic to the ground and wrapped around their legs, pulling them down. 

"No!! Stop.." said Jomi, her mind cracking, she isn't really trapped, but she is beginning to lose control of herself. "You.. don't know her you know.. She might plan with you.. but.." said Jomi, as she looked at Svetlana, while Svetlana looked at her with curiosity. "There's a reason.. She's..." said Jomi, as she fainted, and Cara took over.

"Hehe.. Svetlana, we have an agreement.. now, don't we? I said, keep Jomi restrained.. Not torture her, I might not care for her.. But.." said Cara, before raising Jomi's sword more electric as she forms a cryo blizzard around her. "I feel every single harm you brought upon dear Jomi, and as the _Queen of the Abyss_, punishment is paramount." warned Cara as she descended on Svetlana.

It took one slash, to push Svetlana back. "Tch.. fine. I was being too careless, queen. But, how about them..? What about the plan..?" said Svetlana, as she stood up after getting knocked back. "Oh, I'll take care of them, now.." said Cara before inflicting the same amount of torture at Svetlana, making her gasp before turning to the others. "Now.. just.." said Cara before she suddenly collapsed.

"Jomi..?" asked Rhida, as the trap disappears. The four immediately got to Jomi, as JR looks at Svetlana, she seemed weakened for now. "Let's worry about her later, she fainted. Svetlana is the most threatening." said JR, as he switches to his knife. "Blizzard Storm.. Maybe I can freeze her.." said Rhida, as JR nodded. "Yes. Don't worry, we'll deal with the aftereffects, I can heal like Jomi." said JR, as he turned to face Svetlana.

"That pathetic queen relies on Jomi.. I do not.. Look at her, already collapsed..!" shouted Svetlana as she summoned her lance. "You'll pay for your betrayal." warned JR, as he and Rhida squared up against Svetlana.

"For the greater good. The _abyss_, will envelop everything. I'm sure your little Jomi wants that too, she's just too pathetic to fully embrace her Cara side." mocked Svetlana, before they went at each other. Rhida unconsciously formed an ice sword as she clashed with Svetlana while JR threw his knife to her, but it got stopped as JR smirked and summoned his staff to launch many rocks to her position, but then the lance broke Rhida's ice sword, as a direct slash was now at Rhida. Rhida closed her eyes and prayed she was strong enough to freeze her.

_BLIZZARD STORM._

"Ugh.. my head.. body.. hurts.. much more than usual.." said Jomi, as she woke up to everyone frozen around her, Mack and Fexili nearby, Rhida about to be killed by Svetlana and JR about to smash Svetlana with his rock terraform. "Did I.." said Jomi, before she instinctively used her abyss magic to teleport to Rhida's side, she touched the ice. "Unstable..  more powerful you are... the shorter this.. freeze would be. I would.. know." said Jomi, as she looked at her arms, scars and bruises of her past. "Cara.. she appeared.. didn't she? I think I remember her avenging me.. weird." said Jomi, before dusting herself off and reassessing the situation.

"Svetlana's going to be unfreezed, I need to.." said Jomi before she used her abyss magic to unfreeze everyone except Svetlana. "Jomi~ You're making a mistake, you can help the lightners, but the consequences.." said Cara inside Jomi's head as she suddenly grasps it. The others unfreeze, and scream in various tones. "I know I know.. shut up.. I'm following what you told me, okay?! If.. if any mistakes come, then.. then.. I'll own up to it. We're the same.." muttered Jomi, as the others process their surroundings and go to Jomi, as the barrier around them disappears.

"Jomi! Are you okay, you— you were about to kill us! Wh—what were you two agreeing on and why did you call yourself in third person, if that's not you, who was it? Do you know?!" questioned Rhida, obviously panicking and scared as JR nodded in agreement. "Svetlana.. quick. Let's go out of here, I'll explain!" said Jomi, as she pulled the four near her and teleported to an alleyway somewhere in the city, where she faints again due to not only body exhaustion, but also abyssal magic exhaustion. 

_At Natascha's Clinic_

"That's the story of this place." said Natascha to Mijo, as he nodded. "I see, so your.. Bonfire is a worker's organization that formed when former Silver Guards and other workers formed to fight against the abyss monsters.. Then the blockade happened because of an unknown reason and now.. you're barely surviving as the abyss encroaches, leaving this town and the nearby mines the only holdout?" said Mijo, as Natascha nodded. "There's many more settlements but they're often temporary. People who aren't aligned with us. Especially that robot's group, they're loyal to the architects, but remain only aligned due to the blockade cutting them too." said Natascha before Sasha finally got out.

She is wearing a purple scarf with red and yellow details, as well as a yellow, red, and purple leotard with black shorts. On her left arm is a red band tied together with a purple sleeve, and on her right a fingerless glove that goes up to her elbow. She also wears a pair of black and blue boots of different lengths. Mijo looks impressed. "Wow. This is what you wore? No wonder you took a while.." said Mijo as Sasha pouted. "Hey! It took a bit of getting used to. My old clothing is very different. Very.. complicated. Anyways! Let's go and find your friends." replied Sasha as Natascha chuckled and let them out.

_To Pebble Town.._

"I've always wondered why I can speak my language to anyone here.. Like, do you all have a universal language or somethin'?" asked Mijo, as Sasha pondered, while they looked around the rocky yet lively place. "I've never paid attention, but.. according to Dajovy History, something something.. Basically, Dajovy and the towns below are the only ones that remain, and they all speak the language, and so any like.. refugees had to know.. this. This language. Yeah. We call it Dajovan. Uh.. we reuse it for referring to any.. uh.. national? I don't know if I can call Dajovy a nation, since it's literally one big fortress city, small mining towns against the eternal winter." explained Sasha as they stumbled upon Urda interacting with the local kids.

"¿Uh.. no te hablas ingles?" asked Urda as the kid, who wore a simple blue colored shirt and shorts responded, "¿Ingles? ¿Te significas 'Dajovan'? Yo hablo un idioma de país que ya no existe. ¡Además, yo hablo 'Dajovan', estoy practicando con mis amigos! ¡Polina y Gera..!" Polina stepped up to say, "He does.. speak Dajovan.. But, he asked me and Gera that he has a language, no grown ups speak.. I checked it, it's called 'Jodovski'.. A language from the—" Urda interrupts, "I get it, I get it. Don't explain your world's history to me, I can't even remember my own.."

"Oh Urda? Where are all the others?" asked Mijo, as Urda turned to face the other two, flustered for two reasons; the surprise, and Mijo. "Hey..! I don't know.. I separated when the other three went out.. Um.. they went that way though." said Urda as she pointed to the right, where there was a walkway with multiple buildings on the sides. "Oh, then let's go that way!" said Mijo, before Sasha moved in front of them. "By following me, of course. I haven't been here in a while, but if things haven't changed, I know the in-and-outs of this town.."  said Sasha confidently as the other kids see Sasha and recognize her.

"Sajatra!" shouted the boy as Gera and him hugged Sasha while Polina respective nods. "Hi! Sajatra Sasha!" continued Polina with a smile, as Urda and Mijo looked amused. "Gera..  Iosef.. Sestra is busy, okay? I'll.. promise, I'll play with you.. soon. Just not now.." said Sasha as the two kids pulled back and happily nodded. " I'll be going as well.. I.. uh.. have other stuff to do, thanks guys!" said Polina to the others before leaving quickly. "Then, we'll be here, Sajatra!" said Gera before the two happily skipped off. "Mmm.. Let's go. Your friends shouldn't have gone far, **if** they didn't manage to sneak out." said Sasha as they walked into the pathway.

_Meanwhile.._

"Stay back!" shouted Anastasia as she is surrounded by a mixed group of residents and. vagrants. "Little princess, in the underground, hmm? It seems the guardian has.. given you up." taunted one vagrant, as Anastasia gritted her teeth. "No! I came here of my own accord. But, apparently, peace negotiations aren't your skill, huh? Smoke bombed and kidnapped me, kicking my guards out? Tch." responded Anastasia as she prepared for battle. "Hmph. Help yourself, princess. We're going to show you the resentment of the underground!" shouted another vagrant as he shot a bullet at her.

As the bullet flew, it suddenly was absorbed by a shield of Jamise, as she surfed on over. "Stop! Don't you dare kill someone, not on our watch!" shouted Jamise, as Lauvielle and Leviente were behind. "Mostly you.. though." added Leviente as the vagrants circled them. "Lightners? W—why.." said Anastasia before another group showed up. Sasha and her group. "Tch.. what's all this, hmm?" asked Sasha wielding her scythe around as the vagrants notice her and huddle more to protect themselves. "Молния?!" shouted one as they pointed their weapons at her. "Huh? Still call me that? Jeez, alright.. But, if you know me that well.." said Sasha as she held her scythe to them. 

"You know what happens to my enemies, Отродье?" said Sasha before the vagrants scrambled and left in a hurry as the other residents saw Sasha and left her to deal with the Silver Guard right in front of them. "Wow.. what are all those terms, Sasha?" asked Mijo, as Sasha looked around her. "Some.. Dajobskij I picked up from the elders. Dajovy used to have more people speaking it, but since it's nowadays an elective, only rich people and old people know how to speak it.. Anyways, let's head on to.." explained Sasha as she looked at Anastasia, who doesn't recognize her. "My overworld boss, and what the commotion was about." said Sasha before approaching Anastasia, and Jamise's group.

"Who are you..? Underworlder..? And—" said Anastasia before cutting herself off as Sasha looks at her intently, figuring out what to say. "He—" before Sasha could say a word, a figure comes in. "Sajatra.. Let me handle this, I have.. a few words to say to the heir apparent to the supreme guardian." said a ruffy gritty old man, as Sasha nods and backs off. "Sajatra..? I.. huh..?" muttered Anastasia as Jamise and Mijo's group moves away to a corner, with Sasha. "He's.. the leader of the org that maintains governance here, named Vlad, if it hasn't changed, we're called Bonfire, short term for.. nevermind, it's too long, I don't remember." said Sasha to the lightners near her as they watch Vladimir talk to Anastasia.

"Oh..? I guess I've heard of you before, but.. really, I'm truly here to.. um.. discuss peace terms." said Anastasia, as Vladimir raised his eyebrows. "Is that so? Is this from the supreme guardian and her council of architects?" questioned Vladimir as Anastasia begrudgingly shook her head. "No. I haven't asked them. They've been denying me for months now, but after.." answered Anastasia as she pointed to Mijo and his group. "_they_ arrived.. I managed to sneak in, managing to convince the guards on stand-by. Didn't know I'd get knocked out and dragged here." continued Anastasia as Sasha made fists in her hands, and sighed heavily.

"Then, what are you.. doing here? After all, the marshal isn't with you, so we can't guarantee that the overworld guards will follow you, and.. if your.. **mother** notices, what will be the game?" pried Vladimir, as Anastasia visibly shook but maintained her ground. "I'll try to convince her. I swear. And.. I am looking for Sasha too, since her group apparently went down here, speaking of which.. who's that scythe girl?" asked Anastasia as the two met their eyes and quickly looked away. "Hm? She's the local enforcer. Sajatra. Talk to her, I think.. I have enough info. Wait on Bonfire for the response, she'll be watching." said Vlad, looking at Sasha with a nod before whispering something to her ear and leaving.

"Anastasia.. Yes, I'm.. Sajatra. Hm. I.. think you'll be fine with these.. lightners, I hope. I'm going to help Vlad with a situation on the Great Mine. I'll take my lea—" said Sasha before Anastasia grabbed her, stopping her. "Wait.. Just.. can we join?" asked Anastasia as Sasha hesitates but shakes her head. "No, not yet. Rest for now, with the lightners... Follow them." said Sasha as she turns to Mijo. "You're the leader now. If Natascha arrives, follow her to the Great Mine immediately. She'll tell you. I gotta go." said Sasha before letting go of Anastasia and running to the Great Mine.

Anastasia looks at Mijo then at the path where Sasha took off. "Mijo, is it? Can your friends, back off for a while, I.. have some private talk, and I don't trust anyone else in your.. group, yet." said Anastasia to Mijo, as the others look at them. "Alright." nodded Mijo before turning and saying to his friends, "Mind.. uh.. just chilling there? Got some important stuff to talk about with this gal here." The group acknowledges it, as Mijo and Anastasia moved away, the others talking amongst themselves with whatever.

"Ugh. I wish Sasha didn't leave.." said Anastasia to a quite surprised yet expectant Mijo. "Leave..? What do you.. mean?" asked Mijo, as Anastasia looked at Mijo, with a defeated expression. "I.. mean.. Sasha. Or apparently, 'Sajatra' and.. 'Molnija'..." said Anastasia as Mijo raised his eyebrows and nodded. "You.. knew?" asked Mijo, before Anastasia tiled her head sideways left-to-right. "Kinda. I wasn't sure. Her voice, face, and.. general attitude.. it reminded me of our private times. Where she isn't the stalwart defender of Dajovy. It's weird seeing her like this. I didn't know of her history with the Underworld. If.. she has titles, it must be.. long." explained Anastasia as both looked at the big metal construct that transported people and goods, now it's just bare minerals to help warm the city.

"That.. thing. Has there been fights there, since the blockade?" asked Mijo as Anastasia sadly nodded. "Of course. I was there personally too. Me and Sasha prevented.. the people from rising out of their mining depths as the abyss corruption consumed the outskirts.. It's.. disheartening." answered as she turned to look at Mijo's friends. "I wonder if the people here know what Sasha did while she was gone.. Would they hate her? Or think I or mo— supreme guardian manipulated her? On the outside, it looks clear.." pondered Anastasia as she sighs and slumps over at the railings on the balcony overlooking the downtown.

They were silent for a while, both now melancholic as the chatter of the group behind them and the mining town buzzed around. "We'll see. Let's.. wait for Natascha. I'll introduce her once she arrives, hopefully.. whatever Bonfire's dealing with will be solved, and.. then, this.. corruption too." said Mijo, as Anastasia nodded and continued staring aimlessly at the city below and the construct connecting it to the overworld.

## Author's Note:

WOAH! I'M FUCKING DONE! RUNNING ON 4%! Alright!! like during 15:30 or something during this day.. Idk my phone couldn't take it anymore after writing the above. Anyways, so.. what's the.. after effects, the after writing notes? It took way too long. But whatever, these things take like 1 paragraph per day or something idk. Anyways, the plan is to finish Dajovy, and continue until C7. I plan to edit C1 and 2 instead of rewriting.. Maybe C1, C2 has a concern I want to address.

Mainly C1 is a good intro, but too short, and now doesn't fit as well as before, but I'm planning to complete the series before rewriting. C2 is.. very weird in execution but it's fine for it being how it is, it just needs adjustments. As for C5 to 7,  I don't know when I'll start on them, mainly because of a lot of issues on my end, but.. rest assured C4 is definitely in production.

Even writing this damn author note took a day for some reason. I fell asleep during the night continuation. And now I'm writing this Mar 25, when it was completed on **_March 24 at 15:30_**. Anyways, I think that's all I want to say for this chapter, so goodbye and good day!

## Summary:

The sun is shining, yet abyssal corruption seeks to destroy the winter land of Dajovy. Many people are involved in this entangled mess of a country barely surviving... Fire will burn, and endurance will not falter, a cry of everyone in this _eternal winter._

## Author's Note:

Yo yo, so it's a new chapter for me now! But the story hasn't ended yet. But, of course, it'll just pick up from where it left off, at the start of the Great Mine Arc. And the end of the confrontation about Anastasia!

This is likely going to be faster than the previous one, because this is during the "summer writing' I do. But, don't get your hopes up yet, we'll see. But for now, I guess I hope you enjoy this one, peace!

_A doctor is seen running.._

"That's Natascha." said Mijo as he walked to his group to inform them as Anastasia stayed in her spot, watching the doctor go up the stairs and meet them. "Mijo!" shouted Natascha as she went up, seeing Anastasia, then Mijo with his group. "Vlad and Sasha need our help, come with me." said Natascha to Mijo, before he faced her. "Right. Let's head out!" shouted Mijo, as the group, and Natascha started moving. Anastasia joined up with Mijo and Natascha, as they ran to the Great Mine.

_To the Great Mine.._

The group sees Sasha speaking to some people while seemingly Bonfire members are everywhere, with spears and rifles. Mijo went to Sasha as she finished talking with the other person. "Hey you're here." said Sasha as the others watched them, with mixed anticipation. "Situation's not.. good. Vlad just went into the mines himself, to deal with some.. vagrants. Mostly good people honestly, but the flood of them has caused the mines to go into chaos. And a few odd bad people." explained Sasha before a Bonfire member ran to her and whispered something before he ran away again.

"Another damn clash.. I just got back here.. ugh." cursed Sasha under breath before she looked at Mijo again. "A clash is happening right now, but.. we can't have this large team head into one area only, but.. hmm.." said Sasha before a certain red haired man with a robotic right arm. "Hey! It's Sasha! It's me, Lyka! Your best bud~" said Lyka to Sasha as she turned to look at him, unamused. Then she realized something then turned to Mijo. "Perfect timing. This.. person, who is my.. former— no, current.. partner in this.. organization, Lyka. As.. hmm.. well, he can keep up, at least." said Sasha to Mijo, before turning to Lyka before anyone could respond.

"Lyka, you know your way around the mines right?" asked Sasha as Lyka pondered, scratched his head with his left hand but then nodded. "Of course! Of course.. we've been there before.. where to?" asked Lyka as Sasha pointed to a path that went directly ahead, as a bunch of _Kugol'_ ore, that glowed orange. "Huh? What _are_ these rocks, and why are they glowing orange?" asked Lauvielle, as Anastasia stepped up to answer. "Kugol'. Concentrated pyro energy. Naturally forms deep underground when geo and dendro mix, then with intense pyro energy from the world, it starts to form." explained Anastasia, as she looked at Sasha, to Lyka, to the Kugol' around them, then Mijo.

"She's.. **right**. Now.. we should head into the mines, before the situation spirals more. Hmm.." said Sasha as she looked at the group to figure out how to split them. "Sasha! Tell me their names, I think I've an idea!" exclaimed Lyka as he whispered to Sasha and pointed to people, as Sasha gave the names, with a neutral expression. "Hehe.. I got this..!" said Lyka as he got some paper from his pocket and scribbled something. Then he showed it to everyone. 

THE SUPER AWESOME TEAM!

Lyka (Me, cool) - with Urda, (the shy white haired girl) Lauvielle, (blue clothed girl) and Jamise (dark blue clothed girl)

~~Sasha~~ Sajatra (also cool) - with Mijo, (G.O.A.T.), Anastasia (woah the heiress), and Leviente (red jacket boy)

"What's this crossed out—" asked Anastasia before Sasha wrestled the paper out of Lyka's hands and erased it. "Nothing. Some.. misspelling. Lyka?" responded Sasha as Lyka looked at her in a bit of surprise, then to Anastasia, before going back to Sasha and nodded slowly. "Oh yeah yeah my bad my bad.. Anyway! That's **m—** **our** idea! Pal Sasha~" said Lyka as the others nodded in agreement, with Anastasia more slowly than the others.

"Come on, team! Our goal is to protect our heroes from the robots!" said Lyka as Sasha stopped him from moving. "Robots? You mean, Stravog's robots?" asked Sasha as Lyka nodded. "Yeah! Um.. that.. that.. yes! That's what I was about to tell you, hehe~" said Lyka scratching his head and smiling awkwardly.

"Fine. Go on, just.. meet us at the Central Camp Dugout. You know where that is." said Sasha as Lyka smiled with his eyes closed and left with his group to the side path. Sasha and her group soon started walking on their own path, directly straight. As they head into the railway path, they hear murmurs of;

| "Hey! Stay back!" | "Ugh.. We're.. nevermind." | "I told **her** not to accept those damn vagrants!" | "Isn't your uncle one from _Weld Town?_" | "He's family. Others are a problem." | "Hey! **Treaque** still there, what about **him**?!" | "Stay here, Dr. Natascha will be here soon, as for him? Selaine will get him out, I think?" |

They ascend a ramp and move to a nearby bridge crossing over a large mining area, where a man was on the floor of the bridge, laying his back on one of the structural steel of the bridge. Abyss monsters approach, their blades sharp. "A person! Let's go..!" exclaimed Leviente as the group heads to the bridge to defend the likely wounded man. 

"_Chain Breaker_." said Sasha as she charged up her scythe as Anastasia on her left summoned her gun and took aim, while Mijo was beside her right, sword pointed. "_Thunderstorm.. Reaper!"_ said Sasha as she disappeared into light speed to slash the abyss monsters into glass pieces, Mijo is amused while Anastasia nods in acknowledgement. Leviente wakes up the man by shaking him. "Ah?! What?! What!! Oh, Miss Sajatra? It's you.. ugh.. I swear I was running away from some violent vagrants.." said Treaque, as Sasha dragged him up to stand. "Treaque. Get out of here. Don't get into a scrap and go to Nat, safety." said Sasha as Treaque nodded a lot and headed back. "Bonfire went this way.. I hope you can help Mr. Vlad.." said Treaque before running away.

They continue on their walk along the bridge, before noticing a fight breaking out between random vagrants and a familiar face for Sasha. "Selaine!" said Sasha as she ran to assist while the others caught up with her. "Tch.. What's the deal?! Once Vlad's reinforcements are here, you and your _gang_ are done for!" said Selaine as she is on the floor, while the other vagrants threaten her. "_Chain Breaker!_" shouted Sasha as she charged in, and fought the vagrants with her scythe while Anastasia guns down the others. Mijo charges in with Sasha and helps her defeat the vagrants with his own sword style. Leviente watches, he doesn't have his own powers.. **yet**.

Eventually, the vagrants retreated as Sasha shouted, "**Run.**" before Selaine spoke. "Sajatra! You're here?! We were about to.." Sasha cut her off. "Mhm. All in a day's work, I guess. Oh yeah, have you seen where Chief Vlad went?" asked Sasha as Selaine nodded, and answered. "Of course, they went to the Central Camp Dugout and the nearby areas, we saw robots coming in. If Bonfire were here y'know, none of those vagrants would've dared to threaten us." 

"Uh.. what's with Stravog? What are the robots doing anyway?" asked Mijo, as Anastasia tried to speak up, but Sasha gestured to her to not and let Sasha do it. "Robot from the olden days. Claims to be a 'guardian of humanity'. The other **ownerless** robots are in his command. You know that metal construct in the middle of the town? Used to be a furnace core hub, basically smelting Kugol' to power the city and town. Nowadays, it's overrun by the robots, and has been fought over." explained Sasha as Anastasia questioned, "Robots that can control other robots? Never seen that before.."

"Yeah, princess. The underworld's complicated." said Sasha as Anastasia rolled her eyes, but she seemed more suspicious of Sasha than ever. "Aight. Well, let's go meet Stravog and Vlad then, our mission is to remove the abyss corruption anyway." said Mijo, as he looked on to the next path. "Right. That. We just have to resolve this situation, then we can look for that corruption." responded Sasha as the group prepared to move again.

_On the overworld.._

"Only a matter of time, Jomi~" 

"AH!" exclaimed Jomi, as she looked around her, the rest were sleeping under the cold night of Dajovy. "It's night.. already.. Ugh.. they're asleep.. But.. I.. need.. to.. contact Mijo, or.. no. He hasn't died yet. None of them can, I know that at least.. not until—" muttered Jomi as she looks below to the brick floor of the alleyway. "Until what..? Surely you know by now I have... more hidden plans than you think?" whispered Cara as she manifests beside Jomi, wearing a more regal outfit, not fitting to the winter environment but just her personality. "I know you need them, I just don't know what your deal is with Svetlana... Why risk me being outed as.. an abyss puppet by threatening Svetlana? Or why she thought she can.. ugh." responded Jomi, as Cara went closer, their legs and arms intertwining.

"Reckless pawn. But she can be molded to empower the abyss, and all of the dark world. Now, as for these lightners with you.." said Cara as she pulled back and walked over to each lightner with Jomi, and imbued them with abyss magic. "W—what are you doing..?" questioned Jomi, as Cara continued, eventually going back to Jomi. "A little gift... Oh, and your Mijo? He's.. fine. I can say that for sure, so don't worry about him okay? Worry about your.. friends here, bye!" answered Cara before disappearing as a strange haze compelled Jomi to fall asleep. "Can't resist... ugh.." mumbled Jomi before falling asleep.

_Lyka and friends.._

"Well.. that was quite easy, wouldn't you say, Urda?" said Jamise to Urda, before she nodded shyly. "Mhm. Gals, don't worry! Sajatra and.. your Mijo got this!" added Lyka before Lauvielle spoke up. "I—I'm just wondering, is that Sajatra.. you know, Marshal Sasha or something? It's.. weird, because I didn't see her when I woke up here with Leviente and Jamise. Only the doctor." asked Lauvielle, as the other two looked at Lyka. "Haha.. so you do know.. Welp, I wasn't thinking you'd be fooled. I'm only really calling her by her nickname because of a certain heiress being there. Wouldn't want to get tangled up on whatever relationship those two got going on." explained Lyka, with a small grin.

"Oh? So those two have a... huh." said Jamise, as Lauvielle went closer to Urda to whisper something. "Hey, you draw—" whispered Urda before Urda slightly blushed and nodded quickly. "Mhm. I—I know.. but we're kinda in a situation right now.." whispered Urda back as the two others chuckled on whatever's they're speaking about. "H—hey! Robots!" shouted Urda, as they encounter two robotic humanoids, one with a chainsaw on the right arm and one with a gun barrel, fires bullets. "Don't worry! I've fought my fair share of robots in the fighting club before, same with those unruly guys earlier." said Lyka before enabling his robotic arm, smoke coming out.

"Need a hand? My pleasure~!" said Lyka before blasting the robots with small missiles. Then he moved forward to punch and double punch the robots, the other girls are split on whether to help the man. "Jamise!" shouted Urda as she teleported and blocked a chainsaw shot at Lyka using her sword. Jamise understood her assignment and surfed her way and put up a hydro shield. Lauvielle stood back, wary of danger. "You got this guys! Hays.. if I only had.. ah!" said Lauvielle before more robots in the form of small likely delivery robots now using their bodies for combat. "Hey hey, applause for me, you'll see something.. sparky." said Lyka as he charged up his robotic arm. "Okay.. bu— nevermind.." said Urda, before Lyka already ran to the robots.

"Hehe.. let's see some sparks fly!" said Lyka before his one punch using his robotic arm made an explosion around him, as indeed, sparks flew. "Wow.. not as impressive as mine.. but still cool!" said Jamise, with a slight grin. "Yeah.. cool, I guess." said Urda, as Lauvielle clapped, as she's the only one not holding a weapon. "Cool! Still not liking how I have no powers.. How do you guys get to become cool?" asked Lauvielle as the others shrugged while Lyka answered. "Comes with practice! And having a cool robotic arm~" said Lyka as Lauvielle tilted her head. "Eh.. I don't know, I don't want to fight close.. besides, that looks.. **permanent**." responded Lauvielle before they continued on, notably Lyka with a nod that seemed to be more strained.

_Back to Sasha and 'friends'..._

"This.. stupid mine cart took us longer than all of us wanted." said Mijo, as he pushed the mine cart to unblock the way. "It's necessary. It didn't take long to find the parts anyway with that device you found." responded Sasha, as Leviente chuckled. "Though.. the AI there, ang **snarky.**" added Leviente as Anastasia spoke up. "Let's move on. It looks like a big ore vein is ahead." Sasha nodded and said, "Yeah. Central Camp's here." before the group moved on. The group walked until they stopped at a ledge overlooking the big Kugol' vein, the orange glow almost blinding. The group goes silent as they see Polina and a big humanoid robot in the main area of the Central Camp.

"Mr. Stravog, **This** is the vein everyone's fighting for?" asked Polina as Stravog responded. "Calculating.. with the amount of Kugol' detected, this is enough to supply Dajovy with energy for 213 days. With error margins for around 12 to 15 days, depending on extraction methods used." said Stravog before looking at Polina. "I sense your reason for summoning me is not the properties of the ore. State your true intentions." continued Stravog in a robotic tone. "Of course! I wanted you to.. help the miners! A lot of people have been hurt due to this.. important thing.." answered Polina as Stravog processed. "The main dispute has been resolved and this area is under temporary control. The issue should be fully resolved under 30 days if there is no other external variable." answered Stravog as he looked around then to Polina. "I.. **know**! It's just.. I don't think Bonfire and other miners will understand.." said Polina, as Stravog responded. "Minor human variance is to be expected." Stravog turned to look at Sasha. "As evidenced by your presence, *Marshal of the Silver Guards and Lieutenant of Bonfire, Sasha Sela.*" said Stravog as Sasha dashed in.

"Tch. Our conflict never does end, huh?" said Sasha already wielding her scythe. "Your resistance is futile, Marshal. The optimal way of Underworld survival is seperation from the Overworld. As evidenced by the conflict before the blockade." said Stravog as Sasha scoffed. "Here this again, ugh. I just wanna talk, okay?! But not like **this**, your robots being here threatens the livelihood of the miners. Leave or Молния will strike." shouted an infuriated Sasha. "See, Polina? This is human stubborness and failure at play. Even under abject conditions, humans will divide and fight over scraps." said Stravog as Mijo walked in front of Sasha.

"What she said! And.. oh you're leaving? Man.. that was easy." said Mijo, as Stravog and Polina were leaving. "External variables detected. Recalculation required. Retreat to the main hub. Backup plan initiated. Deploy armed defense." said Stravog as a large robot, humanoid yet decked out in armor. It summons small spider-like robots to assist it. "Well.. goodbye Iosif.." said Polina before Stravog and her ran off. "Huh, that robot has.. a coat? Fashionable." said Leviente before the robot 'Iosif' turned to attack them.

"Oh come on! Let's settle this, Stravog! Ugh.. More scraps." said Sasha as she charged at the robot, alone. "Abyss monsters.. approaching." muttered Mijo, before disappearing in a flash. Abyss monsters, humanoid monsters with blades almost graze Sasha's exposed back. "What?! Didn't know stragglers were here?!" shouted Sasha as she faltered in her focus and got smacked by the big robot to a wall. "Sasha!" shouted Anastasia as she ran and used some healing magic mixed with damage buff.

"Tch.. Yeah?" responded Sasha as she tried to stand up. "Don't. I can tell you're not in the best shape. That hit was brutal. Let that lightner handle this." said Anastasia as Sasha looked at her then Mijo managing to attack both the robot and the monsters, but it's clear he's more defending than attacking. "Two front war's not lasting.. Princess.. Where _is_ Lyka?" asked Sasha, before a sudden spark of explosion comes in.

"Big guy, huh? No match for us, gang!" shouted Lyka as he went in and helped Mijo by punching abyss monsters. "Born to Defy!" shouted Urda as she shot wind swirls that appeared across the camp, grouping the small robots and abyss monsters. Then she plunged down as air swirled and she shot down the small robots and monsters with her pistol. "Gambit of Tidal Waves~" said Jamise, as she poured in and blasted the remaining stragglers while trying to hydro blast the big robot. Lauvielle was there too, but landed near Leviente, where Sasha and Anastasia are looking at the battlefield.

"What sorta team assemble moment is this?! Main bad guy hasn't even taken damage!" commented Mijo as he slashed one robot then an abyss monster. "His armor's hard to pierce, think you can ult this, Mijo?" asked Urda as Mijo responded. "I'll try.. Hold 'em back!" said Mijo before switching with Urda, now Urda's trying to carry the frontline burden while Mijo charges up. Jamise goes to shield Urda, as Lyka retreated as his robotic arm is nearing it's limit.

"_Edge of Sacrifice— You. shall. die!_" said Mijo, as he unsheathed his sword. Time slows down as he moves in lightning speed to take down the robot, a thousand slashes were made as he focused on cutting the robot. Then as he landed on the ground, he looked at the robot then sheathed his blade as glass-like cuts in the space surrounding 'Iosif', tore through it. Iosif's armor was broken through, but as the slash slowly decimates it's armor, it seems Mijo is overclocking his own magic.

"Mijo?" asked Urda as Mijo's lightning flickered. "I know.. Just one more.." said Mijo, as he fell to the ground, Iosif was being slashed but it still had some firepower left as it fired rockets to Mijo and Urda. Jamise was off fighting the abyss monsters nearby and couldn't intervene. "_Defense overclock.._ on." said Mijo, before he went into lightspeed and slashed the rockets, but that meant Iosif is still running. "Ah.. welp, y'all deal with this." said Mijo, after he went back to real time and looked at Urda before falling unconscious.

"That's it!" shouted Sasha as she charged up her own magic, as she managed to break away from Anastasia's hold. "Let's finish this. If he can sacrifice, so can I! _Thunderstorm Reaper!_" said Sasha before also going into lightspeed. But, as she did that, Iosif has locked into Anastasia, Leviente and Lauvielle. As Sasha was about to start slashing she saw Iosif's rockets fire and smoke appear. "Where's this..?" said Sasha before gasping and immediately turning back as rockets fire at Anastasia. She immediately tried teleporting, but that was one ability she lost while still recovering as she was too slow as it hits the three.

"No!" said Sasha as she got out lightspeed as smoke surrounded the three. But then, as the smoke cleared a large pyro shield appeared as Leviente apparently had been in the front, and had awakened his power, now wielding a sword on his right and pitchfork on the left. Lauvielle had also awakened her powers and was forming small hydro bubbles around her. Anastasia was surprised at the awakenings, but had her gun trained where the rockets were. "Nice try. But it looks like we have powers now too." said Leviente to the big robot before throwing his inflamed pitchfork to the robots exposed armor. "Oh yeah! Well, take this **putangina**!" shouted Lauvielle as electrified water was blasted to the robot.

This combination of elemental magic paralyzed the big robot as Anastasia and Sasha helped Jamise clear out the abyss monsters. "_Golden Wind~!_" shouted Urda as she followed up with her floating to above the robot then tossing vines to entrap in further while her swirl enhanced the damage, causing it to finally disintegrate as she plunged to the ground, with her hand on her chest, quite exhausted. "Woohoo! Bad guy defeated! That'll teach Boss Stravog!" shouted Lyka as he raised his left arm  with a fist.

"Definitely.. Lyka.." said Vlad as he finally arrives with his Bonfire members. "Chief Vlad? Where were you..?" questioned Sasha as Vlad looked around the Central Camp. "Dealing with other vagrants. We took many detours to help Bonfire establish treaties and eliminate trouble around and in the mine. Robots were of concern too, though..We encountered less of them, and judging by this battle, might've been stragglers." explained Vlad as Urda collapses and faints, exhausted. 

Lauvielle and Leviente also feel more tired after awakening, but they manage to stay conscious. Jamise also manages to stay conscious, though she's obviously hiding exhaustion. Sasha is injured, Anastasia also has slight injuries and Lyka's robotic arm needs to be repaired.

"Alright... But, let's talk later.. get these fixed up then discuss." said Sasha as Vlad and the others get to it.

_Jomi? and 'friends'?_

"Jomi..?" asked Rhida, as a stirring Jomi begins to awaken. "Look, she's waking up. Rhida, prepare your questions." said JR, as Rhida nods and looks at Jomi directly as she fully opened her eyes. "Ah? Oh hey.. you four are awake.." murmured Jomi before JR and Mack nodded to each other and restrained Jomi to the wall beside Jomi "H—hey! W—whats happening..?" asked Jomi as she was fully pinned as she sees Rhida with serious eyes and Fexili watching for any unexpected guests. "*Jomi..* or should we call you, *Cara?*" said Rhida, as Jomi gasped and instinctively tried to leave, but she was restrained. "J—Jomi's my name I swear, a—and I wasn't lying when I said I'd explain everything! P—please just.. let me go, I'm not going anywhere.." 

"Then explain **everything.** If your real name isn't *Cara*, then who is she? More importantly, why can she take control of your *'body'?* You.. also use abyss magic, something you've explained to be corrupting, so.. can **we** really trust you?" questioned Rhida, as she held an ice sword to Jomi's neck. Jomi was conflicted when she processed the answer. She thought to herself;

'Can.. I really.. explain myself? All my life, I've.. not known what plans are there for me? I can explain Cara, but not why she.. exists. Or why I control this parasitic magic with her.. I can't let her take over though. I can't. I—I just can't—'

Jomi visibly gasped in pain, as dark clouds swirled around her arm and legs. "What is she doing..? Hold on, go behind me, Rhida! You two, do the same!!" shouted JR, as he held a geo shield against Jomi, this time also covering near their legs, as he made it stationery. "This.. power.." said Jomi, as she stood up and summoned her sword. "Not of me, not by me." continued Jomi before sighing as she looks at the lightners for the last time before being taken over by Cara. "But by the abyss queen herself, *Cara.*" said Jomi, as she clutched her chest and started coughing. After falling to the ground, Cara suddenly jumped up and unleashed cryo crystals to overwhelm the shield of JR. "Guess her time is up. Let's try another way~!" commented Cara, before smirking and unleashing a massive electro slash that broke JR's shield. "*Bow before the abyss!*" said Cara as she unleased a cryo wave that immobilizes the four.

"C—Cara.. what are you doing?" asked Rhida, as Cara smiled and waved her hand as Rhida suddenly felt someting painful in her head. "H—hey!" muttered Rhida, before screaming as she fell to the ground. "Everything hurts.. head.. stomach.. neck.. stop.." murmured Rhida, as she shook and trembled. "Oh, dear Rhida, just accept *my* control, or..?" whispered Cara to Rhida as the others were unable to intervene. "Please.. stop this.. Mijo.. help.." continued Rhida, the pain growing insurmountably. The mention of Mijo made Cara falter a bit, suddenly pulling back. "Mijo? He's not here to save you, dearie.." said Cara, but her words were less sure. Rhida couldn't even speak anymore, mumbling and gasping in pain as the others looked in utter shock and betrayal. 

"Cara. Jomi. Whoever the fuck are you. Stop this.. or else." said JR, preparing some magic. "Hm?" Cara immediately used abyss magic to haze JR, as she frees them, but the four are now in various states of agony. "Haha.. good.. good.. now.. you're all mine!" shouted Cara, as Mack and Fexili are now directly under her control. Rhida and JR are struggling as both crawl to prop themselves to a wall. Cara smiles as she makes a chair to sit on, an ice throne. 

"JR.. I.. I know what to do. To.. escape." whispered Rhida, still suffering but now mustering the will to speak. "What.." mumbled JR, as Rhida holds his hand and gives him an thorned ice shard. "Use this.. to run.. run to Mijo.. then.. save us.." said Rhida, before making JR clasp it tight as JR takes control of his magic for a split second, enough to break free, and stand up. He looked at Cara and threw geo rocks, before looking at Rhida, she is looking off into the distance, her magic aura changing. "I swear." JR mutters, before Cara retaliates with an electro slash, but JR blocks with his geo shieled before managing to run away as Cara is unsatisfied, but focuses on Rhida instead to remedy her loss. 

_Well, my dear Rhida.. Let us see what you can do~!_

_In a hospital, in the underworld.._

"Ugh.." groaned Mijo, as he woke up from his overclocking, seeing Urda on the next bed. Natascha, Sasha and Anastasia are talking also on the bed closest to Sasha's room, while Lyka and Vlad talk near them, but far enough to be separate. Natascha noticed and greeted Mijo, "Oh, Mijo? You're finally awake.." Mijo greeted back with a wave before moving to Urda. He sees Urda peacefully sleeping, she looks calm yet shy. Mijo is very much tempted to tease her awake, but holds himself back.

But then, Urda awakens to Mijo, looking at her in her eyes and instantly blushes. "M—Mijo..?" muttered Urda, before springing up and looking away as she composes herself up. "Well.. would 'ya look at that, the two overclocked have risen..!" commented Lyka, as the others grouped up near the two. "Where's.. the other lightners?" asked Mijo, as Vlad and Natascha looked at each other before looking back at Mijo. "They decided, after much rest to go after Polina, the only one likely that can go through that bucket head's steel." answered Sasha as Mijo sighs and stretches his arms.

"Well.. what can we do?" asked Mijo as Natascha answered, "Continue resting. The other lightners have it under control." Sasha added, "Maybe." as the room went silent again before each went to their own conversations.

**Mijo and Urda..**

"I wonder how our friends are doing..?" asked Mijo as unintentionally grazed Urda's arm. "I—I don't know, but.. probably doing well? I trust them.. But.. I thought at least one of them would at least lead them, I wonder why they stayed behind..?" commented Urda, as the two glanced at the others in the room. Sasha kept silent most of the time, leaning on a wall next to Anastasia and Vladimir as they talked and talked, likely about political stuff, they assumed. Lyka was talking animatedly to the other patients in the area, and to them, it felt uneasy to wait for the other three while they remained bed-bound.

"I don't know. But.. about our.. **other friends**.. Do you think Jomi's group is fine..? I'm _really_ worried something happened to them." said Mijo, _very concerned._ Urda sighed sadly. "I don't even want to think about that, Mijo.. Once we get outta here, I have a.. uneasy feeling they're not doing so hot. Svetlana.. is hiding something." responded Urda, before the door suddenly opened and the other three lightners appeared.

"**Good news!** We have convinced the little girl to let us speak with that big ol' robot. Though, uh.. she said he specifically only said lightners so.. um.." announced Lauvielle, as Sasha scoffed. "Of course. Fine. You two, Mijo, Urda. Go with them. I'll.. guide you to his.. uh.. base, which is near the furnace core hub." said Sasha as Anastasia added, "It's.. where the main exit is.." Vladimir then also explained that, "We used to be able to access it freely, but Stravog's robots have fully taken control since the mine incident." Vlad looked at Lyka. "Hm, we'll wait on standby near it's areas as you negotiate with Stravog. Lyka, let's go." Then he gestured to Lyka, who was chatting with a kid, and they left the hospital.

"I'll stay here with Anastasia." said Natascha, looking at Anastasia. Sasha turned to Anastasia, sharply. "What are you doing here anyway? Thinking about.. ugh, the _Supreme Guardian?"_ Anastasia nodded. "Yes. It's fine if I stay anyway. Surely, you won't need my help in nursing your wounds, **Marshal?**" responded Anastasia as Sasha scoffed again but had a faint smile tugging at her lips. "**Fine.** Yeah, we won't get hurt. Just.." Sasha locked eyes with Anastasia. "You better be clear once we're back." said Sasha before she and the lightners went out.

_The Robot Settlement.._

"Are we there yet?" asked Jamise as they trudged through the snow. "Ask me again, and I'll make sure—" Sasha is interrupted when they finally arrive at the settlement, a harsh cold environment yet brimming with people and busy life. "So, this is where the other half of the underground-ers are..." commented Mijo, as Sasha nodded. "People who didn't fit into Pebble Town. Or fled away too late from the abyss corruption. Could've.. been here if.. nevermind. Let's move. You said Polina should be around here, giving aid right?" She turned to Lauvielle.

"Ah— Yes! Um.. she shared antiseptic alcohol and cotton buds near the storage of Weld Town's abandoned orphanage.." re-explained Lauvielle, as Sasha stopped for a moment before muttering, "Weld Town.. huh?" Then louder, "Okay. Let's find her then. Split up." said Sasha as she turned to Jamise. "You're coming with me _missy_." then they veered off while Lauvielle and Leviente also separated, leaving Mijo and Urda alone together. "Alright, just find a little girl with a red coat, shouldn't be too hard." said Mijo, as he scanned the crowd. Urdda nodded, her eyes looking around nervously but stayed close to him.

_Stravog's Mansion Inner Gates._

Polina tinkered with a Kugol' energy generator, her small hands connecting fryed wires to keep the vagrants' lights on. Then she stepped back as she inspected the device, the Kugol's orange glow flickering. A heavy thud echoed behind her, as she spun around, nearly dropping her elemental tools.

"**Polina**." said Stravog, his towering robotic frame looming over Polina as his coat fluttered in the blizzard. "Ah! Mr.. Stravog!" Polina squeaked and jumped as she nervously looked around before looking at Stravog's eyes. "I was just *fixing* these wires so the lights the vagrants use don't go out..! I—It's important.. haha.."

"Acknowledged. Power stability is **critical** for the settlement's survival." replied Stravog, precisely curious. "But, I have another query to ask. The.. robots detect external variables, the lightners who are around this settlement. You authorized their presence. Explain." Polina nodded intensely. "Y—yes! I uh.. told them that they can **speak** to you. They.. uh.. are powerful. Mr. Stravog, a—and they also want to end the abyss corruption. I—I only mentioned the lightners so.. Bonfire won't cause trouble.. I—I did **good**, r—right..?"

Stravog processed her words as his optic sensors glowed orange. "The underground's safety has always been my primary directive, established by the *architects* before the blockade. Kugol' has sustained Dajovy for a long time, but the *abyss phenomenon* disrupts this fragile stability. The lightners, powerful yet unpredictable. The human conflicts before the blockade have reduced the probability of surviving the next year by 19.1%. Their presence risks more instability."

Polina frowned as she stepped closer. "B—but.. they fought the robots to protect the miners..! They're not like the other vagrants.. or.. Svetlana. G—give them a chance, Mr. Stravog!" Stravog tilted his head. "Humans, can be compared to chance variables. My calculations provide efficiency. If the lightners can neutralize abyss corruption and de-escalate conflict, I will reassess their viability and intent. Lead them to me, Polina." Polina beamed as she hugged Stravog. "Got it! I—I'll find them! I—I think I know where they are.. Y—you'll see¸ they're heroes!!" She packed up her tools then scurried off.

_Sasha and Jamise.._

"Damn this fuckin' tin head mo—" Sasha stopped herself as she groans at another beat up robot. "Uh.. that's the third robot you destroyed.. You didn't wanna.. do trivias?" asked Jamise, tilting her head. "I don't want to. Besides, they're not that strong. Solo'ed them." Sasha picked up the Level 3 Certification Key card. "Ah, what's this for?" Jamise asked. Sasha looked at her then trudged through snow to go directly to the gate that holds them back from the inner gates.

"What the.." Sasha stops as she sees the rest of the group just hanging about near the locked gate. "Why are you **just** here?!" asked the other four lightners casually talking. "They said Polina was inside fixing the electricity and that the gate is only accessible through like.. Stravog approved robots. I mean, she's the one meeting us right? So, she should be out and about if she's looking for us." reasoned Mijo, as Sasha sighed and waves the key card. "Beat up some robots." said Sasha as she inserted into a nearby keycard machine and the gate opened.

As the group was about to head in, Polina appeared, taking an.. admittedly very unsafe circle platform elevator. "O—oh! I—It's you lightners..!" said Polina before she noticed Sasha in the forefront. "U—uh.. umm.. you're.. not supposed to be here.." commented Polina as Sasha scoffed. "Uhuh. I know kid. Anyways, you five, go. I'll wait here, I guess." Sasha said as she turned away then headed back to outside of the gate walls. "Welp, guess I'm speaking now, Polina, let's go meet Mr. Stravog." said Mijo, as Polina nodded and the group started heading to the mansion directly when an abyss monster swooped in, blocking their path. "Shit! Abyss monster Outbreak?!" shouted Mizo, as he immediately went forward and battled the abyss monster, who blasted Mijo with cryo and pyro projectiles as Mijo deflected it all.

"Oh no.. We must get inside as soon as possible but how about the vagrants..?" commented Polina, looking around them nervously. "Listen, me and these two are going to stay behind and eliminate these *roadblocks.*" said Jamise, pointing to Leviente and Lauvielle, who nodded in acknowledgement. "Yeah, Mijo! You got this, hero-man!" said Leviente as Lauvielle added, "Uh.. hopefully it's small..? But, yeah, go." Mijo nodded and grabbed Urda with him as the two faced off against the abyss monster, while the others spread out, the three taking the elevator to the lower levels of the settlement.

The abyss monster before them is a mix of blazing star cores on the left and the icy starry sky on the right born out of the abyss corruption, it is floating. "Urda, trap it!" shouted Mijo, as Urda fired a tornado that trapped the monster as it fired more projectiles. Urda quickly followed up with a deflect to prevent Polina from getting hurt as Mijo swooped in and unleashed a powerful electro slash on it's core. It takes a while as Mijo plunged the sword into it's core as it roars and tried to use it's arms to burn and freeze Mijo before it was fully stabbed, leading to it's disintegration. Mijo lands on the ground, heavily breathing as the other two move forward to his place. "Come on, let's move." Mijo says, as he stands up and the group moved to the mansion gates.

"O—oh, I can do this! Petrenko!" said Polina as the robot who looks big, and has a retractable pyro shield and antenna to call for backup. "Yes, Polina?" asked Petrenko. "Uh.. authorize me and uh.. those two to enter the mansion, please?" said Polina, as the robot analyzed Mijo and Urda then said, "Access granted. Mr. Stravog is waiting for you." said Petrenko as the heavy-duty metal gate opened. "Thanks, Petrenko! Come on!" replied Polina before they headed into the mansion where Stravog is fighting some abyss monsters with his pyro blasts and physical steel.

"Ah! Mr. Stravog?" yelped Polina, as Mijo immediately supported him, launching some slashes to the abyss monster mimics of robots Stravog controls. "Ah.. the abyss phenomenon is getting worse.." Polina comments as Urda shoots from her pistol tornados to finally gather and trap the scattered abyss monsters fighting Stravog's robots. "Hold on, ***Golden Wind!***" shouted Urda, as she fired a bunch of dendro projectiles that further amplified Mijo's electro slashes as the monsters are disintegrated one by one. "Finally." murmured Mijo as Stravog blasted the last one monster remaining.

"All targets eliminated. All available robots respond to backup." said Stravog as the other robots leave to go fight as Stravog looks at the two lightners. "You're the representatives of the lighners?" asked Stravog as Mijo nodded. "Of course! Yeah! All others are.. ahem ahem, busy right now." said Mijo as the two went to the main part in the middle of the courtyard that had snow and stone. "Acknowledged." said Stravog as he turned to look at the lightners fully. "Lightners of the Fountain, do you have a plan to stop the abyss phenomenon, and end the eternal winter?" queried Stravog as Mijo and Urda looked at each other before Mijo said, "H—hold on!" The two huddled together.

"So! Urda, we basically think like a robot here. What will make him accept?" asked Mijo, as Urda thought. "So, if I was him, I'd need some assurance other than like 'we kill abyss monsters good' to trust us.. So.." Mijo thought. "Hey you have like dendro or something, right?" asked Mijo as Urda hesitantly nodded. "Y—you're sure I can—?" Mijo nodded. "We need to... convince somehow? Go, and make up something." Urda nodded, "I'll try— just go with it!"

"Lightners, have you made up a plan?" queried Stravog as Urda and Mijo rushed to meet him. "Yeah yeah! You see my friend, here.. she can.. purify abyssal uh.. corruption, there!" Mijo points to an abyssal outgrowth on the walls of Stravog's mansion. "Um.." Urda walks there and looks at the outgrowth as she figures out what to do, then she decided to power up on one of her swords. "Howling Spikes of Tempest!" Urda strikes at the outgrowth, breaking it then using her own dendro magic to take root into the opening causing it to prevent the abyss corruption.

"Ah—! Mijo!" Urda falls to her knees as Mijo comes to catch her only to be met by abyss magic likely corrupting her. "Damn.. Urda, can you—?" said Mijo before her roots slowly dissipated but the outgrowth didn't regrow. "Observation: You are successful in purifying abyss magic, but Problem: The magic itself is very hard to manage." commented Stravog before processing the information. "Will you be able to replicate this, lightners?" queried Stravog as Mijo helped Urda up.

"Hah— yeah yeah totally—! I just haven't ummm.. practiced hah— that's why—" Urda was silenced by Mijo's palm making her blush slightly as they fully got up. "A—anyways!!" Mijo moved his hand away as the other lightners arrived. "Mijo! Urda!" Lauvielle called out, as Stravog processed the other lightners. "Yeah— we should get going, Mr. Stravog.." Mijo clears his throat. "We have proven we can stem the abyssal tide. But, to fully make sure any change remain permanent, we need to close the fountain—"

"The world fountain? The records rumor of it being the one that gives this world it's form. Are you certain, that this is the source of the abyss corruption, lightner?" queried Stravog as Polina looked at Mijo concerned. "Yes, I.. believe so. Don't worry, Polina," Mijo looks at Polina. "..and Mr. Stravog, we promise." Mijo sounds confident, as he says so, reassuring everyone, even himself. "Then, go. Time is of the essence, lightner. This world's fate, I leave it to you." answered Stravog before contacting his robots.

_"Attention all robots: Do not attack any human lightners or darkners. Focus on the abyssal corruption and hordes currently being transmitted to your location. Over."_

"I—I hope your.. um anti-abyss campaign succeeds!" Polina smiles. "¡Buena suerte!" called out Polina as Mijo's group regroups. 

_Anastasia and Natascha.. Natascha's Hospital. Pebble Town. Much later.._

"So, that is it." Anastasia nods. "You only want the blockade to stop?" asked Anastasia to Natascha. "Mhm. Simple as that. But.. we also want our own leaders, after all.." Natascha looks intently outside. "..years of blockade made the divide worse. We wouldn't want to get back to the old ways either, Anastasia." Anastasia nodded. "I.. agree. I will return to the overworld with these terms." 

_"Anastasia!"_

"Ah? Sajatra—" Anastasia responded, before hugging Sasha unexpectedly. "H—hey!! Heiress— Čto—" blurted out Sasha before Anastasia pulled back. "Call me Ana, Sasha.. we talked about this.." said Anastasia smiling. "Shut up... Ana."

"Get going," said Anastasia, grinning. "The lightners', and Dajovy's future is on you two."

## Author's Note:

'Summer Writing'... THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS! Anyway! So, this was a long chapter to write with many bumps and blocks in the way. Many mixing of words and stuff— high effort! Anyway, I'd say that this took a good part of my life, but C5S1: Rend the Skies isn't done yet.

Though, generally the Dajovy Arc P.1 took over almost.. 2 years, June 16 2023 being the start of the first draft. Anywho, I have nothing else to say, other than.. it's done! Good development! And.. I had to expand it to 3 chapters.

Um, the thing is, I didn't realize it'd take more than that one big chapter. But, yeah. I wish I had more to say, but I completed this during school.. That's about it, see ya! Good day, and goodbye!

"Sasha!" shouted Mijo as he and his group met up with her. "We're done here. Let's save the world and seal the fountain." said Mijo, as Sasha nodded and responded, "I'm getting Anastasia, you go and meet Vlad and Lyka immediately." Mijo nodded, as the two separated and Mijo's group rushed to the furnace core hub.

_Furnace Core Hub. Also the only working subway._

"Huh, Chief.." Lyka adjusts his robotic arm. "The robots have.. stopped attacking us." Vlad chuckles. "That's the lightners succeeding. Let's go, we should make sure the way's clear for the lightners.. and the silver guard marshals, hah." Vlad reloads his grenade launcher with more pyro projectiles.

"Agh.. fucking.. stupid... robots.." 

The two turn to the noise. It was coming from a  certain boy, wearing a rock themed flowing jacket, and was holding a wooden staff holding him from falling and a knife, glinting and dulled by relentless use. "Finally.. humans.." The boy looks at the two. "Huh, you look too.." Lyka says, as Vlad interrupts. "Hold on. It must be a lightner. That blue clothed white haired lightner girl, Lauvielle.. She told us they had friends above with Svetlana. _He_ is one of them."

"Oh good, you know them. _Saves the explanation."_ JR limps to the two. "_Where's. Mijo?"_ The two look at each other before looking at JR. "He's.. probably on the way here.." Lyka says, as JR sighs. "Ugh. Do you at least, any of you, have some sort of healing powers?" JR asks, though he's not surprised when the other two shook their heads. "Right. I'll.. just.. wait for my friends." JR says, looking down. "I'll be fine."

_The three awkwardly kept walking as Vlad gestured Lyka to help JR walk._

"Wait! Look! It's them!!" Lauvielle shouted, as the three immediately turn heads. "Lauvielle.. means.. MIJO!" JR starts limping over to Mijo, as he rushes to JR. "What happened?! How did you get here?" Mijo gasped as he comprehended JR's injury. "W—where's Rhida..?" JR chuckles darkly as he gives Mijo a thorned ice shard. "I didn't.. use it.. fully, so..! I can show you." Mijo takes the ice shard and clasped it hard.

"T—this means they're.. in danger, right..?!" Urda speaks up, as Jamise rushes to the front. "Let's move now guys?!! If we're saving our friends, time IS OF THE ESSENCE!!" JR scoffs. "Shut up. Stop talking and move then." JR smiled darkly. "You want to go and save them? Go. See how Cara easily defeats you." All of the people listening look at him. "Cara.. She's.." JR stops for a second or two. "She's the true mastermind.. she got Jomi, Svetlana and the others at the palm of her hand.." JR glances somewhere off to the distance.

"Princess Jomi of the Dark..? Then she's super powerful, huh? Abyss-level?" Vlad speaks up. "Abyss.." Mijo says as he closes his eyes for five seconds before opening his eyes. "Let's move then, we can catch up with Sasha and Anastasia later." Mijo says as shouts from behind them suddenly appeared. "Mijo! Mijo!" Sasha rushes to the front with Anastasia. "We're good?" Sasha asks, as Mijo nods. "Huh. Yes, plan is very simple, head straight for the fountain. JR will guide us there, any threat will be eliminated. That's it." 

"Do we _have_ to kill everyone?" Leviente asked. "Eliminate. In this mission, it can mean incapacitating or injuring them. Just so they can't stop us, any other questions?" JR speaks up. "Is Svetlana kill-on-sight?" Mijo nodded. "For now. Watch out for any signs of surrender and we can hold off and stay guarded." Mijo then asks JR. "What about Jomi and the others, how are they.. controlled by Cara?"

"Mind controlled.. I remember losing control of my body when she tried to use abyss magic to corrupt my mind." answered JR, as Mijo nodded. "Okay, then all others are incapacitated. Don't kill any of our friends or Jomi, got it?" All of the others nodded. "Then me and Lyka's job are done." Vlad and Lyka starts walking back to the underground. "We'll be doing some clean up work and updating Natascha on more of the situation." said Vlad, as Lyka finger-gunned at the rest of the group. "Удачи! Hope you win!!" The two contunue walking away.

"Then, let's go go go." Mijo starts running on the front of his group as Jamise helps JR while the others follow.

_To the skies.._

"Oh Goieth! The monsters are multiplying!!" One silver guards cried. Sasha immediately pulled out her scythe and one shot the one sythed monster about to stab. "Thanks..! U—um.. Marshal!" The silver guard saluted as Anastasia rushed to Sasha. "Let's move, Marshal. It seems the outbreak is happening again. We need to move out." Anastasia turns to the lightners. "I don't think this is a coincidence.. Lightners.." 

Anastasia thinks then says, "We need to find the other lightners.. I don't think this surge is caused by nothing. We know where the entrance of the way to the fountain is, meet us there.. We'll deal with the stragglers." Sasha speaks up, pointing to the lightners. "Hey, it's probably better you lot do it. It's probably more forgivable as a friend rather than some rando you just met hours ago.." Mijo nodded in agreement. "Mhm. Go. I'll— We'll go around and see where the outbreaks are."

The two ran off as the group huddled together. "Uh.. now.. how do we know where to go..?" asked Urda as Mijo shrugged. "I dunno. Anyone have any convenient spells?" asked Mijo as the two grouped looked at each other. "Uh.. JR, do you think this ice shard can lead us to Rhida?" asked Mijo. "Maybe.. But I don't know any spells that do that.. I've been busy surviving.. How about _any_ of you, surely you must've learned something stumbling around in the underground..?" JR looks at Lauvielle, Leviente and Jamise whispering to each other.

"O—oh! Hey!" Lauvielle shouted out. "Luckily, **conveniently**.. I did!" Lauvielle goes to Mijo as she takes the ice shard from Mijo. "This will show us a way using elemental traces and their loose connection with constructs or any.. remnants of elemental use.." Lauvielle does the spell. "Convenient right? But it's like basically connecting to the elemental magic of the person, that's what the 101 told me.." Lauvielle suddenly gasped as the group saw a loose line of ice wrapped in abyss corruption.

"Stop!" Mijo shakes Lauvielle as she stops the spell unconsciously. "Oh god.." Lauvielle is wide-eyed. "Mijo. Mijo. She badly needs you right now. That's.. all I'll say, 'cause even a glance and I get the gist of these corruptions.." Lauvielle commented. "I'll explain later, or something. Let's go to Rhida first." Mijo nods as the two follows the thin line of ice, encountering abyss monsters and guards along the way. 

They arrived at Nenisky Street, the former business street turned to an abyss corrupted zone. "Stop. I see someone." Mijo holds his sword as Fexili approaches, his aero swirls pushing away both monster and human alike. "Fexili." Mijo looks at the group. "We don't have time. Not all of us need.." They hear Fexili fast approaching and the winds get more intense. "Quick. Who's staying behind?" Mijo looks at his teammates. "Me and JR." Jamise steps up. "Bitch.. you know.. I can barely walk?!" JR complains. "Hah. It's fine! I can totally solo him." JR scoffs but the other four nod and start running as Jamise shields the incoming focused aero attacks.

The two continue to follow the line until they encounter Mack. It's at Dverstraya Highway, formerly the road to other cities and other buildings, now collapsed and filled with abyss monsters and other phenomena. "Damn. They really spread out.. JR, where **is** the fountain?" Mijo asks as Mack approaches them. "He's.. not here..?" Urda says, as Mijo widened his eyes. "Fuck. Right.. Woops. Anyways.." Mijo looks at Mack, preparing his darkened flames.

"As much as I want to see Rhida.." Lauvielle says, as she grabbed Leviente's hand. "You have to see her. A—and honestly, you and Urda are also cute together, actually..!" Lauvielle smirks. The reactions are as follows; Urda blushes and buried her face in her hands, Mijo faintly blushed but he also smirked along with Leviente. "Bold to say, you're the one holding your boyfriend's hand." Mijo responds.

"Haha.. Enough enough.. Let's focus on the mission." Leviente says as his flame halberd deflected a pyro attack. "He's getting aggressive. Go. Save your GF, hm?" Leviente says as Mijo chuckled as he dragged the shaking Urda with her as Lauvielle shield with her hydro shield. "Hey, love? Who do you think will win his.. affections?" Leviente asked Lauvielle. "Who do **I** think will win? Rhida, for sure. I mean, Urda's acting like she isn't the childhood friend with feelings trope... Which makes it easy for that stubborn _hero_ to not notice." Lauvielle answered as Leviente chuckled. "Hah. Fifty pesos then."

Mijo and Urda encounter Rhida, as the ice line stopped where an even heavier blizzard was happening. It's where a certain Goieth's Corridor is, the pathway to the fountain. Mijo says, "Be careful, Urda.. She's.. very powerful.. a—and I don't want you to be hurt." Urda nodded. "I—I know.. She's.. she's.." Urda was hesitating on words before just shutting herself up. Mijo was about to ask but shifted his focus when he found Rhida in the middle of her blizzard.

"Rhida..?" Mijo cautiously says, as Rhida looks at him, looking almost sad and confused. "Rhida.." Mijo readies his electro blade. "I.. don't want to do this, but.." Urda readies her pistols. "..it's the only way to save you." Mijo turns to Urda, "Quick, dendro shoots then entrapment, I'll.." Rhida charges up an ice shock spell. "..distract, go!" Mijo immediately moves to parry her attack as Urda immediately went and launched into light speed to try to shoot through Rhida's ice shield.

Mijo tried to get closer and closer as Rhida fired ice projectiles and even ice walls to stop him, but he persisted, breaking each until he got close and saw her ice shield. "Shit.." Mijo sheathed his sword to perform iajitsu and cut through enough that he could superconduct electro and break the shield entirely then dodge. So, he did, but when he dodged and saw Urda perform 'Golden Wind' to injure Rhida, instead of looking at him, Rhida turned and saw Urda charging and blasted her back then froze her arms.

"H—hey! Look here—" Mijo decided in the heat of moment to aim for her neck, which made Rhida dodge but fall for an immediate launching of slashes from Mijo, jumping high on the air. Then, as he landed and aimed directly for Rhida's chest, he was suddenly frozen on the feet and promptly fell the ground. "Fuck!" Mijo, unable to move his legs as he saw Rhida look at him, intensely, her facial expression hidden by the forming ice veil on her head.

Meanwhile, Urda was trying to get out of the ground by trying to summon her dual swords to hopefully break the ice, but she couldn't muster enough to just switch until in the barely see-through arena of ice and snow, she saw Mijo on the ground, and Rhida inching ever closer, and what seemed to be a full freeze of his body. "MIJO!" Urda tugged and tried to get out, but it just won't budge until she finally summoned her swords each breaking through as the palms of her hands can finally hold it.

Then when she can feel that wooden hilt of the swords she then made them move away from her hands using dendro vines then made it slash the ice so that she can escape. "MIJO!!" Urda only screamed _his_ name as she dashed through and pierced through Rhida's forming ice shield as she saw Mijo, barely holding on, his body being frozen but his arms firmly electrifying Rhida. "Urda?? GOLDEN WIND, NOW!" Urda immediately followed, pulling back and charging as Mijo further electrified Rhida, making her focus on Mijo intensely.

_"GOLDEN WIND!"_

In an instant, Urda blew through like the wind, unfreezing Mijo and immediately shooting Rhida in so many directions as she pierced through her ice shield and started hitting her form. Rhida's cries of pain were painful to both, the blizzard around slowly receding from her control. As soon as Urda finished, Mijo immediately pinned Rhida to the ground on both of her arms as Urda went beside Mijo to figure out how to deal with the abyss corruption.

"I.. how do you..?" asked Mijo as Urda shakily answered, "Knock.. her out..? I—I think that's.. what we should do even if it doesn't.. erase the abyss.. corruption." Urda's eyes look at Mijo's sorrowful expression and immediately followed, "I—I'll do it—" Mijo immediately countered, "No, it's fine, Urda.. I'll.." Mijo then put his hand at a Rhida that's barely opening her eyes and smacked her face so she'd be knocked out fully.

"..."

"Mijo!" The other two looked up and ahead as they saw Sasha and Anastasia. "Guess you were ahead of us, huh?" Sasha commented, before looking at Rhida. "Oh.. um.." Sasha was nudged slightly by Anastasia before Anastasia added, "Rhida was here.. I see. Well, lightners, up ahead anyway is the fountain, through the corridor, the others aren't here because of your.. friends' condition." Sasha then followed up, "We.. don't know how to bring them back, maybe.. the _princess_ knows, but.. she's.. yeah, we'll have to fight her too."

"Right, Jomi." Mijo stands up. "I.. have to.. carry her to my friends, is.. that ok?" asked Mijo as the other two nodded and Mijo carried the unconscious Rhida with him. "A—are we going ahead of Mijo or.. should I..?" asked Urda too, as Sasha and Anastasia and shook their heads. "It's.. fine, we.. have a lot to discuss too. We'll wait, most of the abyss monsters have been pushed back to the guard only zones, we can maybe go back and kill more while we wait." answered Sasha as Urda nodded and they head back.

_At the entrance of Goieth's Corridor.._

"Mijo!" Lauvielle called out as she saw Mijo carrying Rhida and Urda beside him. "H—hi! Where's the.. oh." Urda sees Mack and Fexili laid down on the makeshift beds, as JR is watching over, being healed by Jamise. "Mijo, hello..!" Leviente waved at them, as Mijo put down Rhida between Fexili and JR. "Hello guys.." Mijo looks at Rhida. "Do any of you wish to join me to the fountain?" asked Mijo, as he looked around him, the others looking at each other.

"Err.." Urda raised her hand. "Do I.. get a choice? I'm part of some prophecy, right?" Mijo sadly shook his head. "Yeah.. except you, Urda. Who else?" answered Mijo, as Lauvielle raised her hand. "Me." Leviente looked at her. "Oh? Then I'm—" Lauvielle cut Leviente off. "Don't.. just don't. Stick with Jamise to defend this area." Leviente looked at Lauvielle, silently yet contemplative before sighing. "Okay. Gets naman." He summoned his pitchfork, "Just stay safe, babe."

"I.. can not guarantee that, you know. We're fighting Svetlana and Cara." said Mijo, as Leviente nodded. "Yeah, I know. Someone has go support Jamise here, and I have better elemental reactions with her than Lauvielle and her." Jamise cut in, "Hey wait— Why am I staying?" Lauvielle answered, "You're the healer, luh."

"Yeah.. Jamise. Stay. here." commented JR, as he looked up. "You're not done healing my damn wounds." Jamise gasped before turning back to JR. "Right. Well stay safe, anyway." Leviente spoke, "Go now! The longer we're here.." Leviente looked at the abyss monsters closing in. "The more they spawn.. and the longer our friends remain unconscious." The others nodded, as Mijo, Urda and Lauvielle set out.

_At the Fountain Entrance, below the mountain, just after exiting Goieth's Corridor.._

Mijo's group met Sasha, slashing through monsters after going deeper into Goieth's corridor and battling many abyss monsters, it seemed they got stronger yet fewer as they pressed on.

"Sasha..? Where's Anastasia?" asked Mijo, as Sasha looked concerned yet trying to compose herself to battle. "Anastasia went ahead of me. Saying that.. she.. might have a chance of talking to her *mother*, Svetlana." Sasha says this while looking away from Mijo's group, to the vast frozen fields below the mountain they were climbing. Mijo exhaled a sigh of worry before replying, "Oh..? W—wait.. How is she going to.. stop the abyss corruption?" As the group beside him, thought about it and shuddered.

"I.. don't know. She.. just said to trust her, and that while her.. um.. Svetlana's always been headstrong and authoritative.. with new info she has, she can.. convince her..? I.. I.. still don't trust Svetlana, but.. while she's cold on Ana for a lot of political reasons, she still cares for her in a way.. at least, that's what Ana tells me." explained Sasha as the other three nodded. "Hmm.." Mijo hums as he thinks. "Let's continue climbing while we speak." he says, before they started walking up the mountain.

"Why.. did you let her?" questioned Mijo, almost disappointed as Sasha felt accused and answered irritatedly, "I didn't— I just.. couldn't stop her, okay?! There was *no* convincing her out of it. Let's just.. **go.**" Sasha held Mijo's hand and dragged her as she used her powers to go a little faster up the mountain as the others try to catch up.

_Up the mountain, to the **Fountain.**_

"Mother..!" Ana calls out as Svetlana looks at the fountain, doing something with abyss magic, while Cara is using the waiting to project herself out of Jomi's currently unconscious body, and is currently supervising Svetlana's work. "Can't you see, Ana?" Svetlana stops for a moment and looks at her. "This world is bound for utter destruction. By the cold, the monsters, or ourselves, scrounching for the last resources that remain." She turns back to the fountain and looks up at it. "Then.. I met *her.*" She gestures to Cara.

"Oh? Funny." Cara shrugs and looks at Anastasia. "Basically, if you let me absorb.. all the abyssal magic, which.. *by the way* emanates from the fountain," Cara floats and flies around the fountain gushing to the sky. "Then I— we can rebuild this world, one.. abyssal corruption at a time." Cara floats down. "I did say that the world freezes over years from now, or.. that.. Dajovy descends into anarchic chaos once someone here decides to try their luck," Cara smirks at Anastasia. "and end up frozen over, because guess what..?"

Cara looks around her. "This world died as soon as a *certain* Goieth descended." Cara laughs. "Open a fountain, bring change!" Cara walks up to Anastasia. "**Good,** and.. *bad.*" As soon as Cara finished talking, she walked back to Svetlana where they kept absorbing more abyssal magic.

"H—how.. do you know all this, then..?" asked Anastasia to Cara, as Cara chuckled, looked at the fountain and then at Anastasia. "Dearie, I've been in so many *other worlds!* Had traveled far and wide, seeing time.. and.." Cara then looks around her and puts her hands, palms-up. "Can't you predict it anyway? I might as well just take the— use the power here to create a new world." Svetlana glares at her before Cara chuckled. "*Your* new world."

_Mijo's group and Sasha finally climbed up fully and appeared behind Anastasia._

"Hey!" Mijo calls out, as they summon their weapons while Sasha rushes to Anastasia's side. "What's goin' on here?" asked Mijo loudly, as Cara smiled when she looked at her while Svetlana summoned her lance. "Power building. Now, if you mind.. you're just going to have to—" said Cara, raising her hand to do magic when—

"I'll fight them." said Svetlana, turning to face the four. "I *trust* you know what to do, queen?" asked Svetlana to Cara, as she was confused then nodded slowly, just understanding. "Ohh..? The.. ahem. Are you sure though? It's going to delay the.." Cara looks at the other four. "..plan." Svetlana takes a deep breath and nods. "It's fine. I can.. hold my ground." Svetlana looks at Cara, not fully trusting but reliant anyway. "Well, I suppose I should.. get to it then, good luck~!" Cara then floats away, as Svetlana turns her attention to the four, who were guarding an unconscious Jomi who they dragged to their side.

"Um.. are you sure she's not dead?" asked Lauvielle to Urda as she boops Jomi's face cheeks then feels her pulse on her arm.. "It.. feels like it, but.. I do sense a small faint beat.." answered Urda before the two were brought up to face Svetlana when Mijo gently nudged them with his katana's scabbard. 

"So, it has come to this." said Svetlana as she summoned ice soldiers to assist her along with big ice spears. "I'll ask, again. Join me, and defeat the lightners, rebuild this world..." Svetlana raises her lance and prepares to attack. "..or die with them, as I bring your souls with me." 

"Mother.." Anastasia summons her gun. "I don't know what the future's going to be.. but," Anastasia aims it at Svetlana, trembling. "it's not ending like this, defiled by the abyss!" Anastasia fires a shot as Svetlana deflected it and immediately sent her ice soldiers towards them as Sasha went in front and fought them with her scythe and speed. "Remember what we have discussed. I'll.." Mijo looks at Svetlana. "incapacitate her, Lauvielle, protect the two and keep them off Urda as well, who'll be helping me distract."

"Go!" shouted Mijo as he jumped, and dashed to his front and directly meeting Svetlana's blade. "Lightner." Svetlana acknowledged as she clashed her lance with Mijo, as Urda fired off dendro shots to try and entangle her in vines but Svetlana sends two ice spears hurling towards Urda, forcing her to dodge as the spears then follow her, as Svetlana targets them to Urda while Urda and Lauvielle try to destroy it. Then she focused on Mijo, fighting him off with her blade as Mijo dashed around and fired off multiple slashes in one place, then another as she blocked one with ice then reflected multiple with her lance.

"Damn." Mijo jumped and sliced an ice spear in front of him as Lauvielle jumped in with a hydro shield electrified as it broke the ice spears following him from Svetlana. "This ain't gonna be easy." Mijo exhales a deep breath, and sheathes his blade. "A fighter, huh?" Mijo looks at Svetlana through the ice soldiers she kept summoning. "Uh.. we can revive Jomi, uh.. if my healing magic **somehow** works." said Lauvielle as Urda and Mijo looked at her, surprised. "Look! I— learned a lot, okay?! I just don't know if I remember it correctly, so I don't mention it, *until* we need it.." 

Lauvielle looks at Jomi. "A—anyways! She's not dead, dead." Lauvielle kneels and feels Jomi's pulse. "Yeah, usually... um, it'd be harder to revive someone, using that star, but she's not.. she's just... **very weak.**" Mijo nodded. "Okay! Good idea. She has insane powers, right Urda?" said Mijo, as Urda nodded in agreement. "She'll be key to defeating Svetlana, and.. maybe Cara, if she even returns." continued Mijo, as the other two nodded. "Okay, same plan, but Urda, focus on defending Lauvielle, I'll try to force Svetlana to stand down with '_Edge of Sacrifice_'." Mijo then, charges his blade, electrifying with blue sparks as he moves to Svetlana again.

"Urda?" called Lauvielle, as Urda was shaking while shooting down ice spears. "Yeah..?" She responded, hurriedly. "You uh.. um.." Lauvielle looks at Jomi being healed by her before looking at Urda again. "You good girl?" asked Lauvielle, as Urda brought her weapons down to the ground, thinking before switching to dual-blade and cutting ice soldiers heading their way. After so, she exhales a shaky breath and shakes her head. "N—no.. I trust Mijo, I'm just.." Urda looks at Mijo, more focused at attacking Svetlana, yet clearly waning as he prepares his ultimate attack. "...worried, a—aren't you?"

"Heh, I am, but he's a powerful guy right? Besides, the two of you have already fainted due to exhaustion. I'm sure he knows his limits." Lauvielle turns back to Jomi. "Now uh.. heh, focus girl, the battle's not over." Urda nods as she switches to her dual-stance form (sword in her left hand, gun in her right hand) then shoots and slices a big ice soldier to pieces.

_Meanwhile, Sasha and Anastasia, still busy fighting ice soldiers..._

"Where did Svetlana gain like a hundred ice soldiers to throw at us?!" shouted Sasha, exasperated as she uses her scythe to slice four ice soldiers yet more just fill in. "I guess I haven't seen **mother** fight at full power.. She only ever uses her lance and some cryo enhanced stuff..." commented Anastasia as she shot an ice soldier, then another one, again and again. "Even when we went underground?!" questioned Sasha as Anastasia answered, "I—I mean.. maybe abyssal corruption let her summon these?" asked Anastasia, as Sasha scoffed and felt her ultimate slowly ticking up to be usable.

"Mijo's attacking Svetlana, did you hear that he's using his ultimate or something?" asked Sasha as Anastasia answered, "Maybe? I wasn't listening good, but they seem to be doing something with Jomi as well?" Sasha nodded. "The three were planning to revive Jomi somehow, that's probably why, why bother dragging her body somewhere more covered..?" Sasha gussed as she felt her ultimate ready. "Back me up, Ana." Sasha stopped and charged her ultimate as Anastasia shot down ice soldiers coming to Sasha. "Mhm, Sajatra~" Sasha gasped as she faltered charging and shouted, a bit red, "What?! Hey! That's.. that's what the kids call me, okay?! You're not a kid, are you, _Princessa?_"

"Ahahaha, okay.." Anastasia was smirking, a bit red as well as she shot down more ice soldiers. "Hurry up!" called out Anastasia as Sasha groaned and continued charging. "I am!" Sasha closed her eyes to focus.

_To Mijo, fighting Svetlana._

"What are you planning, hm?" asked Svetlana as she deflected more of his slashes and even managed to cross blades before Mijo dodged and landed behind her. "Something~" Mijo launched more slashes as his eyes then glowed blue. Before the two could move, a sudden sound of ice cracking and being split was heard as the two heard Sasha eliminate all ice soldiers as Anastasia fires a focused bullet at Svetlana. "*Edge of Sacrifice!"* Mijo then sheathed his blade then unsheathed it as time stopped and he sliced through Svetlana's ice wall, then her cryo shield before getting a cut at Svetlana's chest.

As soon as he sheathed his blade, glasses cracked and broke as time and space returned to normal, as he saw Svetlana pushed to the edge of the mountain's edge at it's north, Svetlana covering her chest while her lance is plunged on the ground, holding to it as Sasha and Anastasia moved to Mijo's position. 

"It's done. Svetlana. Stand down." Mijo pointed his katana at her, unsheathing it again. "Mother, it's done. Stand for your crimes against Dajovy, and the corruption you have let rampant." said Anastasia, in a more shaky yet resilient voice. "The Marshal commands you, Supreme Guardian to give up the fight." added Sasha as Svetlana was looking down at the ground, unable to fully look at them yet. It was a tense minute or two, as they stood there, slowly approaching as Svetlana looked up, with narrowed eyes.

**_"I won't."_**

Then, the ground shakes as Cara arrives, on a giant robot's shoulder, named 'Chukyn'. It's a large robot built out of metal and intense Kugol' concentration, making it a very powerful pyro attacker. It, however needs a lot of energy to power, and has been dormant since forever. However, it seems Cara is wielding a geo lance of her own, and that the robot is surrounded by intense abyssal magic, powering it.

_"Here I am, my partner~"_

Cara floats to the front of the robot as she looks at the three looking up at her. "As much as I want to keep this going, I— _we_ have a world to create."
