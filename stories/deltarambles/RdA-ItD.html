    # C1d DeltaRambles: Reunion de Avance

Deltarune-inspired story: ()

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees his best friend Urda. She was waiting on him, because there was a good project they had to do, so they went, and not so long class was over. But after a while of cleaning, they went home but before going, 

Mijo said "Yo, so i heard of this rumor that like near the you-know emerald room, there was like a whole dark world-" 

Urda said "You really think that deltarune exists for real!" 

Mijo said "Unlikely, but hey the probability's there." 

Urda said "Really, how do you even access it? The room's dark or its-"

Mijo cut off "Alright maybe its not really there, BUT! I mean its open, i think?"

Urda said "Really, huh?" "Well if you keep talking about it, seriously dude."

So after closing up the class, they went to the place and tested the doors.. They were open! They entered but it was dark... Too dark. 

Mijo said "Ok, but like lets check if the lights work"

Urda said "So what, you can fall and- Oh, he's gone."

Urda then thought about what would happen if she was asked where Mijo could have gone or more boring days of school, and so she went in, but as soon as she went in she fell and the door closed.

*dark world shenanigans*

Draft Notes: Full of Grammar mistakes and general confusing execution but this is from the original one wrote so from this point i rewrite again.

Summary: A secret hidden in the very top... Mijo and Urda discover new worlds and people?!?! 

Author's Note: Deltarune-inspired story but also taglish all around, also I am kinda not proud of this but the premise is good... I will just write the other parts, see where this goes. BTW the title is from miting de avance which is the filipino version of advanced meeting from my HCPSMSHS Election Days.

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical Honrato student is. Anyway he sees Urda, a random classmate. She was waiting on him, because there was a project they had to do, so they went to the classroom,
and after a while, when it was near lunch, they got an opportunity to go home when the teacher announced:

Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayong 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-" 

Mijo said and everyone said "WOOO UWIAN NA!!!"

So, it was time to go home but Mijo's and Urda's service wasn't here yet and after going to the waiting shed- Suddenly, darkness explodes and it looks like it's near the Fajado Building, near their classroom.

Mijo said "Ooo, its interesting, but it's probably dangerous, but YOLO i guess..." 

Urda quickly cut in and said "Hoy! Mijo diba?"

Mijo surprised, said "Uh, yeah, Hey you wanna go to our classroom?"

Urda shocked, said "Bro, really?" paused and said "Hindi ako pupunta malapit don PERO I am warning you!"

Mijo said "Good point, but-"

But then the darkness expanded and soon the floor was no longer safe. Mijo, sensing something was about to happen, quickly rushed to Urda.

Mijo said "Oh shiiit, this might be our last day..."

Urda said "Well, kung ito ay ang parang alam ko, magiging somewhat okey tayo."

Mijo said "Huh? What does that mean?"

Suddenly the ground shook with fear and they fell to the darkness...

Mijo woke up in the eternal darkness with only a platform. Surprisingly, the fall wasn't that bad. But he decided to stand up and look around. Oceans of darkness are all around and only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and after seeing weird black goop, he saw a bunch of cabinets and tables, perfect for hiding, and so he went there and as he was walking very loudly, he heard *someone*... So he readied up his sword (wait he had one?) and stay cautioned, ready for whoever was making that sound and suddenly Urda showed herself with a sword and flintlock pistol. 

"HEY! Who are you! Wait-" said Urda, surprised.

"OH, ay nako it's just you..." said Mijo, also surprised.

"DAMN... Malapit na kitang barilin! Dapat meron kang sinabi..." said Urda apologetically.

"Yeah, woops sorry!! Well what do we do now???" said Mijo, as he put his sword away.

"Huh, waait a minute... Meron ka lang espada... Ako merong espada AT baril!" said Urda, mockingly.

"Well, that doesnt matter, i can deflect your bullets with my sh-" but there wasn't a shield in his inventory... "-sword! Yeah.. my sword.." said Mijo embarrassed.

"Haha! But ok punta kaya tayo, uh doon?" said Urda, pointing towards the only path not going backwards. 

"Aight, let's go!" said Mijo.

They went together towards the darkness and after walking a lot, they saw a school that had like a gate and guardhouse like Honrato! 

"Yo! We found something! Its honrato?" Mijo said, very confused.

"Whaat? Uh nakikita mo ba na may tao?" Urda said, also confused.

"No... Can we go in?" said Mijo confirming.

"Kung hindi, meron tayong.... isa pang opsyon."
said Urda, pointing to her gun. 

"Sure. But like we DON'T have to... I'll join you though if it ever comes to that however.. " said Mijo, thinking about it.

"Fiiine... Sisiguraduhin mabait ako... Sa kanila..." Urda said, whining.

So they went in, and the gate opened for them.

"Ok???" Mijo said, being confused at the whole situation. Urda kept quiet, silently observing everything.

They turned towards the gym and saw everyone! 

"Uh..." Mijo said, then saw a person and said "Hi! Do you know- wait he is just.. ignoring me!" Hey!" Mijo said, getting more anxious decided to ignore it and move towards the gym but then time quicky flew by from 3:00 PM to 5:05 PM.
As fast as they walked in, it was suddenly time to leave.

Urda spoke up. "Ayah, ano ang nangyayari dito? Puro nakakabaliw na nakikita natin, siguro meron nangyari satin ah, Mijo?"

Mijo rebutted, "Well, right ka, nahulog tayo papunta sa dilim, but kasi kung namatay tayo, dapat ba kaya merong tayong makikitang demonyo dito?"

Urda answered, "Luh, baga ito ang personal na hell sa atin-"

Mijo interrupted, "O pwede itong yung... Alam mo yung runedelta?"

Urda said, "Yeah, you uh keep talking to me about it, so i rewatched some of it."

Mijo said, "Oops, well, hopefully useful naman ang na-aral ko don... Wait.. kung galing sa Fajado, then magsearch tayo don..."

In response Urda said, "OK!"

But she continued to wonder if she was the one controlling time as, she was looking at the clock and it was moving wherever she thinks, 5,4,3 PM, anything really but it was kinda liberating, but she needed to find out how it works...

Though, as she thought that, Mijo found the source. The Biolab. But as soon as they opened the door... It wasnt the same biolab they left when they were... Alive? But, with nothing left to explore or find, they went in..

*Game has been started*

Immediately skeletons raise from the ground... They didnt look friendly. Both of them drew their swords and started fighting.. First, Mijo slashed through the skeletons, but found out that swords are really hard to wield, he eventually fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Urda with her insane reaction time managed to dodge and shoot all skeletons and stabbed one directly in the rib cage but due to inexperience she also fell to the ground.

Mijo who was very exhausted and tired said, "These skeletons... AHHHH why can't i fight them like i practiced to? I always stab myself more than them!"

Urda who was the same also said, "Yeah! Me too man... My aim is pretty garbage and the sword too.."

The skeletons approached, holding their swords... They had to think of something.

Mijo said, "From what i know, we usually don't have powers but since this is WAY different SO we should be able to do SOMETHING!"

Urda said, "I agree! Hmm..." 

Urda tried to harness whatever power she had, but she got hit in the stomach before she could do anything.

Mijo said, "Ah shit! Right, these stupid skeletons, OK I deal with them you get whatever you have... If it doesn't work uhhh I don't know?"

Urda got up and said, "Ok then.. Thanks for the sacrifice!"

Mijo scoffed but continued trying to defend against the skeletons which were many but he was able to kill a couple before he got pushed back.

Mijo said, "Are you heckin' ready or something???"

Urda said, "No... Of course not!"

Both of them looked desperate and sad. As the skeletons approached and slashed one last time against them suddenly, they felt power resonate in them... As soon as they felt it, first Mijo immediately began to rip through skeletons, bone by bone and second, Urda was able to stop time and throw a sword into a skeleton before shooting a bunch of skeletons multiple times before resuming time.

Mijo screamed, "DIE! DIE! YOU BONE HEADED CREATURES!!!" As he was slicing like a lightning bolt.

Urda said more calmly, "OK.... Fuck all of you skeletons!" before shooting and stopping time a lot.

The skeletons were outmatched in magic and so they all died, piece by piece. Eventually the battlefield cleared and both were left with bones and more bones.

Mijo and Urda were breathing very heavily and were super duper tired...

Mijo said, "Hahaha... We won! Against skeletons... Honestly.. kinda thought we would just die.."

Urda responded, 'Yeah, didn't know we had powers!"

Mijo said, "Well we do now, i guess..."

Urda said, "Finally, i can fulfill my dreams of becoming like... Kahazu! or close enough?"

Mijo questioned, "Who is Kahazu? I vaguely remember who that is-"

Urda answered, "Oh right, di ka nga pala naglalaro ng shingen-"

Mijo said, "I do! I just haven't gotten to that part yet..."

Urda said, "Yeah, sure, like what at least a day of playing-

Mijo said, "WHAT?!? Bro.... I'm still in Monshtat..."

Urda laughed and said, "That must mean you have only started playing... Sige na nga, tutulungan na nga kita, when we get out of here of course."

Mijo said, "Sure then, lets go!"

So they pressed on towards the dark fountain that was in front of them, reaching a _familiar_ star...

Urda shouted, "Wait! Mijo!"

Mijo responded, "Wha- Ohh."

A _familiar_ star twinkled.

Mijo said, "Well, when a star appears in front of us, that means, its a save point... Which means, WE LIVE IN A VIDEOGAME?!!?"

Urda said, 'Wait Mijo, it could just be a feature of the world, i mean... I guess it could be but does it matter?"

Mijo said, "Good point, i was just jokin though, lets save!"

Urda said, "Sige!"

So they saved their progress and after that, they encountered enemies that with their full power are easy to win against such as big butterflies, ladybugs, and frogs. Eventually though they made it to Cab Castle. Where they met the Skeleton king...

King said, "Ah yes, the heroes, the 2 humans and... where are they???

Mijo responded, "What do you mean? There's only two of us..."

Urda also responded, "Yeah, kailangan ba namin ng mas marami pang... tao?

King said, "Well at least three, but it doesn't matter, ya'll lose anyway! Prepare to die!"

Then King suddenly summoned the elite skeleton guard to kill the lightners, but then suddenly a blast of white lightning slashes through the bones wiping most of the guards.

Mijo said, "Woah! What was that?"

Urda said, "Ang cool!!!"

The hooded figure said, "You're lookin' for me?"

King said, "You! Of course you would start like that! No matter! I will kill you myself!"

Then, a bunch of skeletons and lab beakers broke through the gate, and were about to surround the three heroes.

Mijo said, "Yooo?? Where did they come from???"

Urda said, "You know malakas tayo diba?"

Mijo said, "Ay, oo nga!"

The hooded figure said, "Yeah, no, trust me, you are NOT surviving if you don't get my help."

Urda said, "Oh really, meron akong time travel!"

Mijo said, "Uh yeah, what she said, also like didn't you like well, destroy the skeleton guards?"

The hooded figure said, "Well, they were surprised and i'm stronger."

Urda ignored them and started to do her thing but then she felt weaker and weaker as she teleports around. Mijo tried to do the same too, by ninja dashing all of the enemies but by the end he felt the same.

The hooded figure said, "Welp, guess i was right..

Mijo and Urda, both breathing very heavily and said, "Shut up..."

The hooded figure said, "Well, I will deal with these troops that are still fighting and uh you guys deal with the king ok? Ok."

Mijo said, "Ah, fine."  Then he whispered to Urda and said, "Uh i don't trust this person, do you?"

Urda whispered back, "Yeah, I don't, but we have no choice.."

Mijo then said to the hooded figure, "Yeah.. Sure!"

The hooded figure nodded then went to the skeleton army to kill them as Mijo and Urda thought of a way to kill the Skeleton King.

King said, "Oh finally, your conversation's over! I can kill you now!"

Urda said, "Wait you could? THE ENTIRE TIME???"

King said, "Of course, it wouldn't be fair now wouldn't it? I wouldn't wanna kill everyone here and that's it, i wanna enjoy the experience. Oh you all are already stabbing me..."

Mijo said, "Yeah no, we don't wait, unlike you!" as he stabbed the king.

King said, "Alright, that's it!" and fought back, by pushing both out of sword range.

Mijo quickly ran to the Skeleton King, and dueled the king as Urda shot the king and tried to run to the King's back before getting stopped by some of the skeletons.

Urda shouted, "Oof! Skeleton's here!"

The hooded figure then quickly went to Urda's position and fought the skeletons as Urda now finally has the opportunity to backstab the king. So she did. Then the king fell to the ground, defeated.

Urda said, "I guess that's it?"

Mijo said, "Let's ask the hooded figure, hey! hood guy!"

The hooded figure then went to Mijo and Urda, and said, "What?"

Mijo said, "Are we done? Can we go now?"

The hooded figure said, "Yeah. Oh! just in case you need me, my name's Jomi."

Mijo said, "Alright Jomi, uhhh-"

Urda interrupted and said, "Where's the fountain?"

Jomi said, "There! Behind that huge door, near the throne."

Urda said, "Ay, salamat po!"

Mijo said, "Wait how do we close 'em, the fountains, i mean."

Jomi said, "Just like.. believe in yourself to get your heart out to the fountain, metaphorically."

Mijo said, "That... Doesn't help but whatever.."

Jomi said, "I swear that's how it works!"

Urda said, "Well Mijo, alam mo ba kung paano gumagana ang fountain?

Mijo said, "No? I'm just saying it's dumb."

Jomi said, "You all should probably go, don't you all have like entire days to experience?"

Mijo said, "Yeah, yeah..."

Then Mijo saw a smaller door to the right of the throne.

Mijo said, "Hey! Jomi! You know what's behind... That door?" pointing to the smaller door.

Jomi said, "That is where scopicro is imprisoned, a strange figure..."

Urda said, "Well? Patayin natin siya, Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Let's just see what they look like."

So Mijo and Urda went to the smaller door, opened it then went down the stairs, until a huge prison is revealed with a microscope-looking figure.

Mijo said, "Well, guess you're..."

Urda interrupted, "Scopicro!"

Scopicro then looked at them, walked straight towards them and said, "Well, well, well, here are the 'heroes', hmm? You don't have the key? How unfortunate. I wanted to test skills, and more! But i guess i'll have to stay still and be observing."

Mijo said, "So Urda, uhh you wanna go back and like get the keys for this guy?"

Urda said, "Nahh, lets go, gusto ko na matulog!"

Mijo said, "Well, whatever your deal is, its off."

Scopicro said, "As you wish, after all, lightners are our 'saviours'. Wouldn't wanna disobey them.."

As Mijo and Urda went up, they discussed Scopicro.

Mijo said, "Well i guess we are considered saviours i guess, even though we barely won against the skeleton king."

Urda said, "That's so cool! I wonder why? Maybe Jomi knows about it?"

Mijo said, "You wanna get home right?"

Urda said, "Yeah, but interesado ako."

Mijo said, "Sure.. but lets just go home."

Urda said, "Fiine.."

So Mijo and Urda went out of the basement door, and went behind the throne, opened the huge door, and saw the fountain.

Mijo said, "A'ight, andito na tayo."

They walked closer and closer to the fountain until they were just a few meters away.

Mijo said, "Wait! Who's closing the fountain?"

Urda said, "Uhhh, you! Duh."

Mijo said, "Of course..."

*Game End*

So Mijo closed the fountain by materializing his heart out of magic then raising it to the fountain. Music played as light took over the vision of the two. Then they woke up in the biolab. Almost like they were just dreaming? Both of them woke up.

Mijo looked around and saw Urda and said, "Yo, uh, you still here like after 12?"

Urda responded, "Yeah.. umm.. wait, what's the time?"

Both checked their phones and it was 5 PM...

Both said, "WHAT?!?!?" and quickly got their things and went outside the biolab.

Mijo said, "Uhh hey, this was locked..."

Urda said, "Well, hindi na ngayon."

Mijo said, "Lets close the door... Bye Skelly!"

Urda also said, "Bye Boner!"

Mijo said, "Dude, they're called skelly. Cause skeleton?"

Urda said, "No, they're called boner, mas maganda yung pangalan niyon!"

Mijo said, "Oof, whatever, our parents must be worried for us."

Urda said, "Oh yeah. I gotta go, bye!"

Mijo said, "Yeah, see you next week!"

Both waved their goodbyes, Mijo went home.

Mijo went home, and realized that, the "12 uwian" message didn't get sent so he was fine.
His parents only figured it out after they went home and talked to Mijo. Mijo was surprised and so for the first time sent a message to Urda.

Mijo: Yo, were you bothered by your parents about the whole 12 yung uwian?

Urda: NO uh not really i was about to message them then uhhhhh i fell asleep????

Mijo: did they get like a message about it like in the parents gc?

Urda: nahh they don't check that which is awfully convenient!!! 

Mijo: well thats good i guess. 

Urda: 👍

So Mijo decided to sleep, it was probably nothing anyway.

Notes: WOOOOO DONE AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF!!!!!! Seriously... Like i have yet to complete the other ones so good luck to me!  Goodbye! See ya next time!

<p id="C2"><md-block># C2 DeltaRambles: School Chess Game</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: Chess Game in school and shenanigans happen. Friends missing and searches...

Author Notes: A friend helped me with this and uh yeah just wanted to play chess and decided this is a great chance to write something. So i hope you enjoy it! BTW might not be inline with the canon this was based on as i write this i havent finished the last one but yeah!

Mijo steps into the school, and begins walking to class and after opening the door and taking a seat:

JR said, "Hello Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Hi! Uh so what you doin' "

JR said, "Reviewing for AP quiz later... Have you reviewed?"

Mijo said, "No... I am right now!"

JR said, "Ok..."

Then JR talked to someone else and Mijo decided to sit and review until Urda showed up and got Mijo's attention.

Urda spoke up, "Hey... Mijo, So meron akong sasabihin sayo na dapat tayo lang may alam..."

Mijo said, "Ok... Hmmm what's it?"

Urda said, "So, meron ka bang nakaranas na dark world?"

Mijo said, "Uhh, yes???? You did too? I thought panaginip lang 'yon!"

Urda said, "Yun din isip ko, pero it was too real at di ko pa nakakalimutan eh..."

Mijo said, "Well, ano na gagawin natin?"

Urda said, "Well, kung magkapareho ang pagbukas sa runedelta sa dito.. Pwede natin gawin ngayon?"

Mijo said, "Hmm, gusto mo?"

Urda said, "Oo naman, na-obsess nako don, meron nga kong drawing at iba pa, diba ikaw din?"

Mijo said, "Oo, ako din-"

Then, Jamise interrupted: "Hey! So ayaw ko interrupt yung bonding time niyo, pero pinapapunta na tayo sa gym..."

Mijo and Urda both stared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After following Jamise, and heading outside of the class, into the gym but then suddenly darkness spews out of the door near the chemistry lab that was near the pathway to the gym and at first all of them were surprised but then Urda and Mijo quickly ran towards it and jumped into the chemistry lab and as Jamise was chasing them: "Hey! Wait!!!".

But as Jamise stared into the abyss, she decided to jump in as her friends were there and the flag raising ceremony was gonna be boring anyway and so she decided to jump and fall.

*darker, yet darker*

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

Mijo and Urda both fell at the same time but as soon as they landed, they saw that they were in some kind of black and white board and looked around to see: Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn! It was chess!!! But instead it was too big and so they had to make a choice: white or black?

Mijo spoke up, "Yo uhh what color should we choose?"

Urda said, "Uhhhhh, Di ako naglalaro ng chess?"

Mijo said, "White it is then!"

So they took the white pieces and started the game. They vaguely saw a person with black jacket, long hair and a staff playing the black pieces.

Urda said, "So, since di ako naglalaro ng chess, dito lang ako, manonood."

Mijo said, "Ok then, watch and learn!"

*Meanwhile, in the light world...*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*Back to the Dark World!*

So the game started, white moves pawn to e4, black moves to e5, knight moves to f3, knight moves to c6, bishop to c4, knight to g5, pawn to h6, queen to h5, queen takes knight g5, queen takes pawn f7, king moves to d8 and queen takes bishop g8, checkmate!

"Thats... Checkmate! Why was that so easy, i mean... Who else trolls like that?", said Mijo.

"Probably Jamise, but i can't prove it!", said Urda.

"What? But-" said Mijo before getting cut off by that person playing black suddenly running towards them.

Mijo and Urda both readied up their defensive stances and watched as the figure eventually was visible enough to be... Wait.. isn't that Jamise?

Mijo and Urda calmed down, and talked to Jamise.

Jamise first spoke, "Hey? What was that for?"

Mijo responded, "Bruhhh, we thought you were an enemy! Of course we had our weapons out... But for the chess game uhhh-"

Jamise cut off Mijo, "I understand! But.. Ano ang lugar na'to? Why are we dressed up like fantasy magical people?"

Urda spoke up, "Basically, Jamise, parang alternate world na may cool monsters, powers at mga lugar na pwede i-explore!"

Mijo then responded, "Yeah, what she said.. We should head out... Malalate tayo!"

So they went out of the chess room and into the unknown...

*At the Light World...*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

*Lauvielle joined the conversation!*

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As the lighteners were going around in the dark, looking at the endless piles of scientist gear...

Jamise spoke up, "Soo like pano ba maglaban? You guys seem prepared?"

Urda first said, "Basically, Jamise, parang meron magpapakitang mga kalaban... At pag nagkaroon ng musika, pwede mo na sila patayin! At umm??"

Jamise spoke again, "Mhmm.. at??? Ano!?!!"

Urda said again, "Magkakaroon ka ng mga powers.. diko alam kung paano, di din alam ni Mijo eh.."

Jamise said, "Ah! Kaya pala staff lang ang meron sakin haha... Paano gamitin?"

Urda thought as she spoke, "Uhhhhhh????"

Mijo said, "I think it's believing in yourself? At least that's what the sign said last time..."

Urda said, "O-Oh yeah!! Yuon!! Nakalimutan ko..."

*Light shines through!*

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason.

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"

JR and Rhida nod in agreement.

Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."

As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

JR said, "Ok... Perfecto! Baka Nandito sila, papasok ako.." and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.

Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"

But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.

Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."

Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

So they threw the bags into the dark. Mijo's, Urda's, Jamise's and JR's were the bags that they decided to throw to the chemlab.

*Back into the Darkness.*

Jamise said, "But Urda! I don't believe in myself! I need to know EXACTLY how!!"

Urda said, "Well, nakuha ko yon noong mapapatay ako ng mga skeletons doon, so... Pwede kaya yon?

Jamise said, "THANK YOU!!!"

Then they heard someone fall and hit the ground...

Mijo said, "Sino yon?? Let's draw our weapons..."

Jamise said, "Bakit pala lagi kayo nakaready? Di naman siguro laging may nagtinig meron kalaban?"

Urda said, "Necessary kasi... Last time di kami ganito, na-ambush kami..."

Jamise said, "Oh! ok..."

A doctor-like person appears out of the darkness, with a staff that looks like it has a snake wrapped around it on the right hand. On the left hand, it looks like they had a kitchen knife. They immediately blast dark energy.

Urda and Mijo both quickly ran away from the blast as Jamise tried to deflect the blast with her staff before getting blasted back to the pair.

Mijo quickly ran to the enemy only to realize that the doctor was JR, and that he almost stabbed him.

Mijo shouted, "Wait! Wait! Aren't you JR?"

JR responded, "Yes... Wait are you... Damn it."

Mijo said, "Yeah I'm Mijo, that's Urda and that's Jamise."

JR said, "Oh, nice."

Jamise then ran up to JR and said, "Hey! You just blasted me with... Dark energy!"

JR apologized and said, "Yeah, uh i didn't notice you as Jamise! Sorry!"

JR whispered to Mijo, "Maybe."

Urda then caught up with Jamise and said, "Oh! Hello JR!"

JR said, "Hi!"

All of them grouped up and decided to walk to the door in front of them.

*Back to the Light*

"And that should be all the questionnares, alright class, it looks like it's breaktime, so have your break!" said Mam Maris, the AP teacher.

"Goodbye Mam Maris!" said the class before the teacher left.

Lauvielle went to Leviente and said, "Uh hey, you wanna... talk about... JR and the others?"

Leviente responded, "Sure. What exactly about them?"

Lauvielle said, "Well, yung madilim na chemlab?"

Leviente responded, "Well, i'm not sure what happened there, we can only assume that- patay na si JR."

Lauvielle got annoyed but continued and said, "Well pwede 'yon o di pa sila patay, pwede naman din yon!"

Leviente said, "That can also be the case, pero di natin talaga maalam kung di tayo pupunta don ulit."

Lauvielle responded, "Well, I guess... Iintayin nalang ba natin hanggang 5? Kung ano ang nangyayari doon, siguro naman, di maganda?"

Leviente said, "Oh yeah, yung malaking butas sa baba ng chemlab..."

Lauvielle then saw that Rhida was going outside the room and so Lauvielle dragged her to the conversation.

Rhida questioned, "What, why did you bring me here? Lauvielle?"

Lauvielle answered, "We are talking about the dark chemlab. Now do you have any insights to what we're talking about?"

Rhida said, "Well, i guess about THAT, we are out of options here, and uhh, titignan nalang natin kung ano yung mangyayari."

Lauvielle and Leviente both nodded and Rhida went back with her other friends as Lauvielle and Leviente talked about something else.

*Darkness awaits*

Mijo opened the door as the rest followed behind him, the place was filled with chemistry, beakers, flasks, tubes, goggles and more. They fought the heroes but they lost. The heroes were just too many with their knife, swords, and staffs. But as they fought and spared through enemies, Jamise was standing by the side though, as Mijo, Urda and the still-learning JR to deal with the enemies, though she was the one asking the group to not kill everyone.

Jamise talked to Mijo, "Yeah no, i don't get it, how do you do it??? JR has nice magical powers but... he didn't go through like a life and death situation?"

Mijo responded, "Well I don't know either but i know a person, they're named Jomi and they have a black hood. That's it. They probably know something about it"

Jamise questioned, "Asan siya then? Like meron bang shop, or like somewhere where nakikita niyo siya?"

Urda jumped into the conversation after listening in for quite a while, saying, "Well, nakita namin siya noong final battle against... A skeleton king!"

Jamise responded, "Whaat, sis, magagamit ko yung powers ko, kung meron ako, sa last battle??? Hays..."

Mijo then went to JR and said, "Hey! I have been meaning to ask, how did you get your powers? Like did you spawn with it or you got it?"

JR said, "Got it." then showed the knife to Mijo and said, "I was fighting some chess figures, and i had to use my knife, but after almost losing to a queen attack, i used a staff that i had out of nowhere and you know the rest."

Mijo responded, "So like, you killed all the chess figures and then you met us?"

JR said, "Yup."

Mijo responded, "A'ight, that's nice."

Mijo then went back to Urda and Jamise chatting.

Jamise said, "How is the magic defined anyway, like what you dream of something?"

Urda said, "Uhh, your essence? Your very soul?

Mijo said, "Hey! Uh like JR got his own do-or-die situation.. I guess you can try fighting?"

Jamise said, "But Mijo??? I only have a staff, you guys have like guns, swords, knifes, but I have a stupid staff that doesn't do anything until i get magic."

Urda turned to Mijo and said, "Mijo, paano ba pala like yung pagpapagaling sa mundo nito? Besides the save points?"

Mijo said, "Well, I don't really know, until someone reveals their healing powers... Wait!"

Mijo then goes to JR and says, "Hey, uh since you're a... cardiologist? Do you have healing powers?"

JR responded, "Well, i haven't tried healing anyone yet... What? Like is someone damaged?"

Mijo answered, "Well, Jamise, but like what if someone gets hurt while in a fight, we have to get to the nearest save point which is usually a while after a lot of fights?"

JR responded, "I see.."

Jamise said to all of the group, "Hey guys uh we have been talking for minutes now, where's the bad guys?"

Then test tubes attacked the group, so they fought, Jamise decided to attack them with her staff and failed but JR after harnessing the power of a cardiologist managed to heal Jamise begrudgingly and she was fine.

Jamise said, "Oh wow, salamat JR!"

JR said, "Yeah, don't die."

The test tubes got beaten by Mijo and Urda by breaking their fragile glass defense, as Jamise and JR were talking.

Jamise then rushed to Mijo and said, "Hindi gumana yon! I just got injured!"

Mijo said, "Look, uhhh-" Mijo thought about it more before saying, "I don't know sis, uh i guess we'll have to wait and see???"

Jamise annoyed, said "OK. But if we get into a fight, AKO na lalaban ok?"

Mijo said, "Alright, alright, i'll tell the others... Let's see what happens."

Mijo says to everyone else, "Hey everyone, let Jamise fight ok?"

Urda said, "Sure. Mas konting gagawin ko lol!"

JR said, "Ok. I'll watch."

So they moved on, fighting their way through enemies such as until they saw a checkpoint.

Mijo said, "Look everyone! A save point!"

JR questioned, "How do you 'save'?"

Mijo said, "Touch it and like a menu pops up right, like on top of it, press that save bn and you're done!"

Urda said, "Yo, and there's like items in the menu and you get to see stats like health, magic type-"

Mijo whispered to Urda, "Isn't that runedelta menus? Also that doesn't even appear there?"

Urda laughed and said to Mijo, "Of course not! Are you hallucinating anything?"

Mijo responded, "No-" then turned to JR and said, "Look it's simple-"

JR said, "No, it- its fine, Mijo, I already saved. It's as simple as you said."

Mijo said, "Ok then... Let's move on."

So they moved on to the next area, where there were a bunch of enemies, and the area looked like a garden but had many scraps of metal and wood, it seems that it was being used to create the building next to it, though it was incomplete. As they fight through, Jamise strikes up a conversation.

Jamise said, "Hey, these skeletons and beakers are so easy, where's the real deal? Like bosses or something??"

Mijo said, "Well, i don't really know, it depends what we do and how big the world is but yeah, not much i can say right now..."

JR said, "Hey guys! This place looks like our school garden, andito yung honrato statue!" pointing to the statue of honrato near a circle of plants and bushes.

Urda said, "Well, i guess we're near something important i think?"

Then suddenly the statue grew and molded to a humanoid being, out of honrato's statue. It can control little atom-like rocks and has a beaker as its main weapon. It decided to fight the group.

Mijo shouted, "Yooo, why are we getting attacked by honrato?"

JR responded, "Baka nangyari ito sa maraming oras na di ko siya binigyan ng 5 pesos!"

Jamise then quickly pushed the others and shouted, "Guys! Kaya 'ko 'to!"

Then she failed to dodge the atoms but managed to deflect the beaker, and finally blast the beaker using her newly found powers.

Jamise said, "Wooo! Lets goooo!"

Then she got pummeled by the atoms so she had to retreat. The others stepped up and fought the statue.

Jamise shouted from the back, "Guys! Nakita niyo yon!!! Ang cool!!!!"

JR responded, "Yeah, yeah, just keep blasting him ok?"

*TO THE LIGHT*

All of the class said, "Good Afternoon! Mam Arcea!"

Mam Arcea said, "Ok class, lets pray!"

So a random student went to the front and prayed and then the students were allowed to sit down.

Mam Arcea said, "Ok attendance! Hmm.. Asan si Cara, Aman, Rira at si Baltsar?"

Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"

Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... Sige-" and after that class continued...

Fexili whispered to Rhida, "Asan si Balts? kala ko andito siya noong lunch?"

Rhida whispered back, "Ah, umalis after ng... lunch siya kasi... sumakit daw ang ulo niya"

Fexili whispered, "Ohhhh, ok..."

*Darkness.*

Eventually, the statue was blasted to the building behind it, turning it into rubble.

"Yes, YES! I FINALLY DID SOMETHING HELPFUL!!!!!" said Jamise, celebrating.

"Nice. Now uh what?" said JR.

"Yeah, now what, we JUST killed the manifestation of our school founder-" said Urda.

"Now we go there, towards the fountain, duh." said Mijo.

"Wait, is he actually dead or something or he's gonna come back for the next boss battle?" said Urda.

"I don't know, we'll just have to find out, currently this guy's just laying on the building." said Mijo.

"I never understood not checking if the potentially dangerous individual is still alive or not.. Come on Mijo, lets check!" said JR.

"Ok fine. You can check it, but I will not be surprised if we fight a second phase or he's just dead, straight up." said Mijo.

"I'll check!" said Jamise, quickly rushing to the rocks of the statue.

"Oh yeah, he's just a statue now." said Jamise, pointing to a memorial statue just there, in the building.

"Lets- at least put him in his proper place, ok?" said Urda.

"Yeah, i agree. It's pretty simple and fast, anyway." said Mijo.

So they put the statue in the right place and a loud sound was heard somewhere near a big wall.

"Right there. That's where it should be." said Mijo.

"Alright, uh so we should probably be doing something about that... Noise?" said Urda.

"Yes. Definitely. Otherwise we would DIE. And i want to die, but i guess you guys don't want to?" said JR.

"Well, then why don't you just throw yourself at the monsters, huh JR?" said Jamise.

"Because- well, i realized that... Meron akong magagawa na hindi merong kinalaman sa pag-aaral, a way of living for a while, di kona kailangang pang mag-breakdown bawat gabi para magawa lang ang pt, just... Keep calm at pumatay na lang." said JR.

"Joke lang JR! Pero, ako nga din eh, gusto ko na din bumitaw sa buhay. Ang daming gagawin tsaka, dumadami din pag nag-grade 9 at sa susunod, ako nga eh, pupunta sana ako sa gym pero mas maging boring kaysa sa pagpunta dito." said Jamise.

"Uh, turn ko na ba mag-share ng problema ko? O punta na tayo sa bagong area?" said Urda.

"Sige lang, di naman siguro uwian na eh." said Mijo.

The group laughed before Urda spoke up, 
"Ok, so... I have a lot of trouble with anything... Related to school, i suck at math, biotech, but i also just, didn't have any friends and was feeling lonely, until I met you guys... Mijo, you have anything to say?" 

"Yeah, thank you, all of you for being here, i mean, y'all probably wouldn't be here if di na-open ang dark world, which we probably caused-" said Mijo.

"A'ight bro, stop. We... Don't talk about the first one." said Urda.

'Right, sorry, but I... just am so happy to be with you guys today, and hopefully more in the future." said Mijo.

"Awww-" everyone said, collectively.

"We should go, guys. Earlier, we get out... Well, i dont know... There's so many things that wanna kill us so..." said Mijo.

"Ok, let's go out of this place." said Urda.

So off they went out of the statue garden and towards a big gate opened and inside was a big palace with walls placed protecting it.

"Woah, is this it?" said Urda.

"Guess so, can't really be anywhere else and it seems to be a castle like... previously." said Mijo.

"What do you mean, Mijo? The final boss battle!?! Can we finally leave???" said Jamise.

"Oh, I was about to start enjoying the adventure..." said JR.

"Ok. Let's do this guys, i think we can overpower this person's army and then them." said Mijo.

"You sure, Mijo? Don't you have like just a bit of being unsure there?" said JR.

"I'm confident. Let's do this, you guys ready?" said Mijo.

"Yeah?" said everybody else.

"Good enough, let's go inside." said Mijo.

So they went inside, fighting the so-called "Queen's Guard" that were just armored skeletons and beakers. After absolutely decimating them, they decided to go in the throne room.

"Welcome, adventurers. To the end of your journey." said the unknown queen.

"Huh, that was easy... Are you hard to beat?" said Jamise.

"Oh? You want more? I was expecting less from you but... sure." said the unknown queen.

JR pulled Jamise from the front and whispered, "Do you want us to die?!? Stop provoking her!!" 

"Enough talk. Let's dance." said the unknown queen.

"Wait! What's your name first?" said Mijo.

"Ugh, I'm Shley, the Queen of Scicem. The Queen of Chemistry. That's what you want?" said Shley.

"Alright, thanks!" said Mijo writing it in his book of villains.

Shley immediately striked at Mijo first, surprising him and temporarily putting him out of the battle. Urda followed with a quick gunshot and stab, as JR and Jamise blasted her with snakes and balls. JR immediately went to Mijo to try and heal him, this is the conversation that followed:

"Hey! Mijo, Are you okay?? You're gonna be fine. Just.. hold on!" said JR.

"Hah.. i.. never thought that i.. would hear that.. from you.." said Mijo.

"Oh, shhhh, Mijo." said JR.

As this was going on, Shley fired little smoke bombs that concealed her position around them.

"Fuckin- Hey! Come here coward!" Jamise said as she blasted through smoke to try and find her location.

"Jamise!" Urda shouted from behind her as she teleports towards Jamise.

"Jamise- *cough*  -these smokes are dangerous.. They can poison you.."  said Urda, coughing.

"What!! Oh no. Oh hey! Why can't you go through the smoke? Can't you teleport?" said Jamise.

"I.. can't.. I can stop time but i still have to go to that area- you know what- i'll explain later. We are in a battle right now." said Urda.

"Oh shit-" said Jamise, as she and Urda get blasted by Shley using a bomb.

The smoke finally dwindled but then came JR and Mijo, ready to fight.

"Oh you really fucked up big time, Shley!" said Mijo as he comes barreling towards Shley.

"Nope." said Shley as a shield blocks his attack.

Mijo lands on his feet, unfazed but mad.

"Dammit, can you pierce him, JR?" said Mijo.

JR fired the largest blast he could muster and it made a dent, but not much on her shield.

"Ok, so- hey gals!" said Mijo as he picks up the two laying on the ground. 

"No- i'll be fine, just help me get up." said Urda.

"Ah, thanks Mijo, but i am soo fine right now." said Jamise.

They walked over to JR distracting Shley with an army of snakes.

"Ok, so uhh- you guys have a shield? Like anything that protects us, as we plan for a minute or so?" said Mijo.

"I don't have any." said JR, still fighting Shley.

"I.. lets see!" said Jamise before making a huge forcefield in front of her, enough to protect the four of them.

"Niice, Jamise, where did you learn that?" said Urda.

"I.. don't know. I made it up myself!" said Jamise.

Jamise then makes the shield larger and then JR starts to focus on the group.

"Ok. So i have a plan, me and Urda, fight her melee style, draw aggro away from you guys as y'all have better magic damage. Now JR and Jamise, Jamise, try to focus on defense for you guys as you have a shield, meanwhile JR, focus on attack, like huge damage. A'ight that should be it. Any questions?" said Mijo.

"What if we get injured?" said Urda.

"We go to JR as Jamise protects us from harm." said Mijo.

"What if I wanna attack too??!!" said Jamise.

"Well, you do, as long as you protect from any damage because you can defend, JR is less than capable to do so. Sorry JR." said Mijo

'Its fine, i prefer damage anyway." said jR.

"Ok. Anyone else?" said Mijo.

"Nah" said everybody else with a degree of differing no's

"Good, let's do this, as the shield is about to break." said Mijo.

"Wha-" said Jamise before the shield broke.

The battle follows exactly as planned, but then as JR was about to break the shield, Shley opened up walls of fire around her as Urda and Mijo retreated to JR.

"Damn, those fire walls!" said Mijo.

"Uh, what can we even do?" said Urda.

"We... wait?" said Mijo.

"No- wait! Guys! What if i use my shield to punch through those walls of fire then Urda and Mijo quickly follow it with a combined strike!" said Jamise.

"Huh, good idea. Ok let's do it then, but are you sure you can handle the fire?" said Mijo.

"I totally can, just focus on HER." said Jamise.

"Alright, let's go!' said Mijo.

So Jamise slowly pushed up to the fire with the group until she met the fire and quickly went through the fire, weakening her in the process.

"We're through! Just..." said Jamise before fainting.

"Let's not waste this opportunity! Urda, let's go!" said Mijo before both of them attacked Shley.

Shley was surprised by this maneuver as she was easily put down by the two resulting in her defeat.

"Ugh, good job, adventurers..." said Shley.

"HAH! And it was mostly because of... magic." said Mijo.

"Ah of course, i'm gonna heal up now." said Shley.

"No." said JR as the rest of the group pointed their weapons towards her.

"No- Look, you adventurers win. There's the fountain. I will let you through and anyone else." said Shley.

"Hey, where's Jomi?" said Mijo.

"Oh, she's in that dungeon over there." said Shley.

Mijo and Ursa both quickly ran to the dungeon.

"Urda! Mijo! Ugh. Ok queen, you better be truthful in that promise." said JR.

"I promise." said Shley.

As JR healed Jamise, and Shley healed herself, Mijo and Urda went to the dungeons and saw Jomi trapped in the only cellar there that was not empty.

"Oh, uh, Mijo and Urda! You come to.. save me?" said Jomi.

"How the fuck did you get here?" said Mijo.

"You're still hooded? How?" said Urda.

"I'll explain all of it, ok let me?" said Jomi.

"Sure..." said both of them.

"Ok, so shortly after you guys arrived, because, i saw you guys go outside of some building and shortly after that i got caught by some of the queen's guards and as i was brought before her she decided to send me towards the prison for 'trespassing and helping the lightners.'" said Jomi.

"Oh, uh ok. So they just thought that you looked like that?" said Urda.

"Uh? I guess then? Let me out please.." said Jomi.

"Oh shit, the keys..." said Mijo.

"The keys! I think i saw the queen has keys so go to her and get me out of here!" said Jomi.

"Uh, ok! Urda, stay here. I'll just talk to the queen ok?" said Mijo.

"Sure." said Urda.

So Mijo quickly went up the stairs out of the dungeon and went to the queen, who was talking to JR and Jamise.

"Ang tagal naman nila..." said JR.

"So, what you did to those skeletons was, use them as an army for you?" said Jamise.

"Yeah, pretty much." said Shley.

"Hey! Queen-" said Mijo.

"Hay nako, andito ka na! Paano ba tayo aalis dito? At nasan si Urda?" said JR.

"Oh uh, i.. came up here to grab the Queen's keys to let... a friend out." said Mijo.

"Oh? Yeah, that girl, Jomi? Sure, can you tell her no hard feelings?" said Shley as she gave Mijo the keys.

"Uh, yeah, thanks." said Mijo before quickly going back to the dungeon....

"-So that's how this world works." said Jomi.

"Ah, thank you so much! Jomi." said Urda.

"Here, i got the keys, hold on." said Mijo before fiddling with the keys to find what key works until the cell opens.

"Oh, thanks. Mijo." said Jomi.

"You're welcome, queen said no hard feelings by the way." said Mijo.

"Ugh, that queen. Ok fine. Esa reina no es muy importante para mí." said Jomi.

"What? You know spanish?" said Mijo.

"Yeah. Don't worry, nothing important." said Jomi.

"That hood girl is veeery sus right now..." whispered Urda to Mijo.

"Uh, yeah i guess, just keep an eye on her, ok?" whispered back Mijo.

"Do you know what she said? Baga importante 'yon!" whispered Urda again.

"Uh-" whispered Mijo as he thought about it... "Yeah, something about the queen being not important to her?" whispered Mijo back.

"I trust you... Ay! Naiwanan na tayo ni Jomi! Tara!" shouted Urda as both of them followed up with Jomi outside of the dungeon.

"Ok... I had reasonable suspicion that you were about to end my reign using the lightners-" said Shley.

"For a good reason! You know you almost killed them right? And YOU locked me up because of them as well, so i hate you." said Jomi.

"Woah, sisters, calm down!" said Jamise.

"Uh Jomi, what about the fountain?" said Mijo.

"Oh yeah, you guys go there, Mijo, you already know how to close the fountain right?" said Jomi.

"Uh, NO!" said Mijo.

"What, I thought you do? Kala ko alam mo na base sa runedelta?" said Urda.

"Well, Urda, baga magkaiba dito, so sisiguraduhin ko na magkamukha..." said Mijo.

"Uh, well-" said Jomi.

"Hey, Jomi. You really wanna settle our beef? Come have a chess game right here. Just gotta say the word, and i will summon the chess board here." said Shley.

"Ugh, hold that thought, Mijo, I have to win against this tangina." said Jomi.

"Woah, woah, calm down Jomi. I did not know you can be this mad" said Mijo.

"Wait... she knows "beef"?" JR thinks to himself...

"Well, the deal's done. Here!" Shley said as she puts a chess board down.

"Hey! Who's gonna be white or black?" said Jomi.

"A coin-flip, and of course as a queen, i will get the coin myself and let someone flip it." Shley said as she summons a coin that looks like a peso from the Philippines.

"Hey, wait Shley, you didn't tell me you had irl coins!?!" said Jamise.

"I was... getting to that part, anyways you lot should be going home now anyway. So..." said Shley as she thinks about the coin-flipper. "Urda! Why don't you do it?" said Shley.

"Uh sure, why not..." said Urda as she took the coin.

"Wait! Who gets which side?" said Mijo.

"I choose heads!" said Jomi.

"Oh? That's fine. I choose tails, since that's the only option besides that one." said Shley.

"Ok... Here i go then..." said Urda as she flipped the coin and it landed on... heads!

"Well, alright then. I play well in both colors anyway. Ha, you might only play well at white, Jomi..." said Shley.

"We'll see about tha- wait..." said Jomi.

"Yeah, haha, anyway lets just play the game. Whoever wins, wins. Now no timers, just pure thinking, but you probably have to be faster, but don't worry, I'm fair." said Shley.

"Alright, let's do this." said Jomi.

As they played, the others took sides. Mijo and JR were on Jomi's side and Urda and Jamise were on Shley's. The game kept on going, with massive blunders all the way until...

"A'ight.. Knight to G8, that checks your king..." said Jomi.

"Hmmm, King to E8." said Shley.

"Castle queen's side..." said Jomi.

"Queen takes g2..." said Shley.

"Aha! Rook takes d6." said Jomi.

"Ah bollocks. Better hope that she doesn't notice the mate in 11." thought Shley.

It turns out... Jomi did notice.

"Ummm... King to e8..." said Shley.

"Queen moves to e7, checkmate." said Jomi.

"Huh, good game, Jomi." said Shley.

"Hah, you too i guess..." said Jomi.

"Well, that's it! After an hour! We can go home!" said Mijo.

"After all of that, i still don't understand chess..." said Urda.

"Don't worry, I'll teach you then." said Mijo as he winks.

"Uyyy, may move na si Mijo!!" said Jamise.

"Shut up, Jamise. But sure, if we have time." said Urda.

"I permit you adventurers, and Jomi, to go home. I have to clean up the throne room anyway." said Shley.

"Ah, i just remembered! We closed the fountain before right Jomi?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, that's why i will teach you again so you don't forget and get stuck here." said Jomi.

"I knew it! You forgetful Mijo!" said Urda.

"Sorry, sorry, now uh let's go close that fountain." said Mijo.

So they went to the fountain behind the throne again and saw the huge geyser filling the sky with darkness.

"I mean, Jomi, me and JR also need to know how to close a dark fountain, I mean they pop up randomly, and what if Mijo or Urda isn't there?" said Jamise.

"Good point, well, we're here." said Jomi.

"Uh so who has to do it this time?" said Mijo.

"You obviously, Jomi told us you were the one to close the previous ones so... Its you because you have experience, we don't." said JR.

"Ok, alright, I'll do it, uh Jomi?" said Mijo.

"Ugh, so-" said Jomi.

"Wait- i think i got this. Let me tell him. So that he never forgets it." said Urda.

"Sure, whatever makes him remember." said Jomi.

"Ok, so i think that you have to materialize your heart out of magic then raise it to the fountain." said Urda.

"Well said, Urda." said Jomi.

"Ok, i got this, uh goodbye Shley and Jomi! Hopefully you guys don't fight!" said Mijo.

"Oh, don't worry adventurer, paperwork will bore her so much she will be apathetic towards me." said Shley.

"True. You're lucky." said Jomi.

"Ok let's do this." said Mijo as he materializes his heart again then raises it again to the fountain. Music played again, and then light took over as the lightners woke up in the chemlab on the test table, like they were dreaming, again.

"Ugh, ah shit!" said JR as he 'wakes' up from seemingly sleeping.

"Oh! Damn you scared me, JR!" said Jamise.

Both Mijo and Urda woke up at the same time but they didn't say anything.

"So, uh what are you doing in the chemlab JR?" said Jamise.

"Uh, I was trying to find you guys, strangely enough, everything seems fine here." said JR.

"That's because you were in what's called a dark world." said Urda.

"Yeah, and all you think is a dream, it's not. Though everything that we can do there doesn't go up here, I think, anyway." said Mijo.

"Wait, WHAT?! Like everything that happened there actually happened like you guys know who Shley is.. and that hooded girl?" said JR.

"Yeah! Also that girl's name is Jomi. You didn't hear?" said Urda.

"This opens up so many possibilities! Wait, what time is it?" said Jamise.

"Shit, it's 5:30 PM!" said JR.

"Ah, now about that, I don't really know what happens, but somehow you have an alibi for why. Right Urda?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, guys don't worry! I think we'll all be fine." said Urda.

"Well, i gotta go, i saw that i said there was a practice and at exactly 5:30 i will be at the gate, so bye guys!" said JR before rushing out.

"Hey, wait where's our bags- oh it's right there." said Jamise.

"I think they put it here, there's no way it is magically teleported here, probably when JR and friends were tryna find us." said Mijo.

"Good point, anyways I have a long commute so, I'll let you guys be, bye!" said Jamise as she left.

"Hey, uh don't you have a long way to go from here?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, so uh see ya! Um, oh yeah! Better study chess next time i guess, bye!" said Urda as she left in a hurry.

"Uh, well ok. Hmm everything here seems fine, well i better go, if I stay too long here, i might be seen." said Mijo as he walks out of the chemlab and closes it.

"Woah, wait, isn't it usually closing time? Oh well, I'll just trust that the magic in the dark world works here. Ok i better go now." said Mijo as he goes out of the hallway near the rooms and goes home.

He opens his phone after eating dinner and chats with Urda.

Mijo: Hey i have an idea

Urda: ok but what

Mijo: So we make a GC to compile the latest dark world shenanigans as after today uh its getting out of our control so we make one and invite Jamise and JR there. To secretly speak bout the dark world.

Urda: cool, you make it

Mijo: Yeah on it, we'll continue there ok?

Urda: 👍

So he makes the new GC called the "dark world for lightners" and invites Urda, JR and Jamise.

Urda: 👍

JR: oh new gc for this huh @Mijo

Jamise: Oh nice I didn't think of making one but you beat me to it @Mijo

Mijo: Yeah, i know so this is just where any general thing related to the dark world is posted so everyone knows atleast by the day so uh good night everyone!
Reactions: ♥️3

He closes his phone and studies for the next day, as school marches forward and he isn't going to be left behind.

"Alright, another day, another dark world. Let's see what happens in the next one. Good luck to all who will and have participated. I better study now." said Mijo to himself as he picked up a notebook.

Author Notes: A friend helped me with this one

Summary: 

<h1>section done</h1>

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

*1 hour later*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*1 more hour later*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

Lauvielle joined the conversation!

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason. 

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"

JR and Rhida nod in agreement.

Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."

As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

JR said, "Ok... Perfecto!" and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.

Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"

But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.

Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."

Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

They went back to their classroom and soon enough, rumors started spreading that the chemistry lab was so dark, that not even light from outside could illuminate it and it even spread darkness but only then only a select small people specifically from 8-Clam confidently know but it got around to the teacher, she checked the cctv and found nothing, like literally just black from the hallway and the chemistry lab. Weird, guess the cctv is broken..

Lunch came and they decided to sneakily take Urda, Mijo and Jamise's bags to the Chemistry Lab where they threw it hopeful that they are there along with JR but they weren't sure and even if, it was the only spot that could hide something so they threw it there and left it until later.

Mam Arcea said, "Asan si Cara, Aman at si Rira?"

Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"

Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... So-" and after that class continued...

<!--CHAPTER 3 WOOOO-->
<p id="C3"><md-block># C3 DeltaRambles: Into the Dark</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: A winter morning brews upon a new dark fountain, Mijo and his friends explore this winter landscape in hopes of adventure, friendship and to make new paths.

Author's Note: This one is fully developed after moving up from my previous grade in which i wrote most of the concepts that i borrow from so expect different here.

Mijo wakes up and goes to school, like any normal day. But when he goes to class and sits on a chair., the conversation is a _bit_ different...

"¡Hola! So uh what's the talk?" said Mijo.

"Ang dark world, Mijo." said JR.

"Ay.. Oo nga. Uh, what about it?" said Mijo.

"When i was about to sleep, i got awoken by a loud explosion towards.... the grade 7 building." said JR, looking a bit serious and concerned.

"Uh, why didn't you tell it to the gc? Jamise could have gone there y'know?" said Mijo.

"Well I don't trust her, and also since you and Urda are the more experienced ones, i wanted you guys to go first before Jamise does something stupid.." said JR.

"I understand, but why don't you just say it to her like 'urda and mijo only' or something like that." said Mijo.

"Because, she might just ignore that or tell someone else and have them go in. We can't risk being found out like that." said JR.

"I mean it's only.. a couple of students that are going right? I mean i don't think Jamise is that stupid to tell it to a teacher or anyone not trusted by her." said Mijo.

"Well, she might trust someone that we don't..." said JR before hearing a door open. It was Urda and Jamise with Urda carrying her bag as Jamise arrived earlier but quickly got out of the classroom.

"Oh, it's them, we should talk to them about it, and don't worry, we can stop Jamise." said Mijo.

"Fine, just make it be sure, ok? Ok." said JR as Mijo nodded, then they went up to the two speaking to each other.

"Ganon ba? Girl, go to him~" said Jamise.

"Hey guys, so... dark world." said JR.

"Ay, speaking of the angel, yeah, ano ba tungkol sa dark world?" said Jamise.

"Mayrong impormasyon nakuha si JR tungkol sa dark world, importante 'to kaya secret natin ah?" said Mijo.

"JR has information about the dark world, importante 'to so secret natin ah?" said Mijo, looking at each person that he was talking to as he talked.

"Ge, but what?" said Jamise before being interrupted by the teacher arriving.

"Hays.. guess we can't escape this time.. We'll just have to wait until recess, good? Good." said Mijo before all of them returned to their seats.

Meanwhile as Leviente and Lauvielle were going back to their classroom, they saw something...

"So, that's how it is huh?" said Lauvielle.

"Oo, I didn't get to say, because-" said Leviente before seeing a room that has its 2 doors open but is dark, way too dark inside.

"Hey, there's a... new room that's dark.. Hey! Last time, when JR went there, he didn't actually die..." said Lauvielle, staring into the dark abyss that replaced the room inside the door.

"Precisely, I actually don't know why. But then again, that experiment can be considered concluded and the result is.. it's safe?" said Leviente.

"Huh, yeah." said Lauvielle as she checked her phone.

"It's.." said Lauvielle before getting interrupted by "7:15. Late na tayo. Let's jump in, JR seemed way more happy earlier so bakit hindi?" said Leviente.

"Jump in?! Bro, that is a **big** hole, no pun intended but also, we might just not survive whatever's there so I will just take the sermon and wait for them i.e. Mijo or Urda because-" said Lauvielle as Leviente jumps in.

"No, wait! Ugh, well- guess I'll have to jump, I really don't wanna explain why Leviente isn't with me." said Lauvielle before jumping in too.

As they are in the dark world, Mijo is worried and asks JR a question...

"Oh hey! JR, uh- do you know where Leviente and Lauvielle went? They haven't been back here and I'm worried they might have gone into the dark world?" said Mijo.

"Oh, they might have, they both got out of the classroom and well... you know." said JR.

"So a dark world might have opened and they are not here... We better be there as soon as possible." said Mijo.

"Hey guys! Shhh.. Sir has an activity for us.." said Rhida.

"Ay, mamaya na lang Mijo, gawin na natin ito." said JR.

As the class does schoolwork, the duo land in a cold and snowy area...?

"Ugh, jeez, it's cold here..." said Lauvielle, shivering.

"Well, I have this jacket, na nakasuot sa akin..." said Leviente.

"Hmmph, lucky. Di ko naman maasahan na dito tayo mapupunta..." said Lauvielle.

"To be prepared, is to be unprepared..." said Leviente.

"Heh? Bruh, I'm literally unprepared right now and I am **freezing**." said Lauvielle.

"Well..." said Leviente as he looked around and saw a guard house beside a school gate..? "There _is_ shelter nearby, you wanna go there?" said Leviente.

"Yeah, I would rather face whoever's there than staying here, magiging yelo pa ako." said Lauvielle.

"Alrighty, let's go there." said Leviente as they headed towards the guard house.

"Hello po? Mayrong tao po ba dito?" said Lauvielle.

_Silence_.

"I guess nothing, let's break this lock!" said Leviente.

"What?! For all we know, someone's there and they are just a... heavy sleeper?" said Lauvielle.

"Yeah. I'm gonna break in anyway. Hmm," said Leviente as he looked through his inventory.

"What, do you even have a lockpick? Or a hammer? **Any** tools?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, ito! Haha- kawawa mo naman..." said Leviente as he held a comically large hammer, showing it to Lauvielle.

"Hu- What? But, hu-" said Lauvielle as she pulled out her own sweater.

"Haha, you had a sweater the entire time.. haha~" said Leviente, laughing a whole lot.

"Ha- Ok, pero pupunta pa rin tayo sa house ah?"  questioned Lauvielle.

"Yep, ayaw ko pa rin yung lamig." said Leviente.

So Leviente smashed the lock and it broke so now they can get in. They entered and quickly went inside the guard house. Outside the snowstorm got more intense as both of then try to build a makeshift wall to prevent the guard house from freezing inside.

"Aw no! Ang niyebe!" said Lauvielle, trying to block the snow using the scrap cardboard inside.

"Nieve? Like yung sa spanish... Ah! Snow, right?" said Leviente doing the same thing.

"No, sa Filipino! Hmm, well, galing sa Spanish nga kasi wala tayong niyebe dapat sa Pilipinas!" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, okays. Anyway, this should be enough." said Leviente seeing the cardboard barely keeping them from the snow outside.

"Aww.. How can we go back to school now... Ang crazy ng snow na'to. Sa Pilipinas pa!" said Lauvielle, dying inside from anxiety.

"Well, lola, i think we're not in the Philippines... Nasa entirely different tayo na world!" said Leviente.

"Hah? Then, how are we? We're gone from our world, how about our family, our friends...?" said Lauvielle, holding back tears.

"Hold on. It can also be a dream, but-". Leviente looked at his hands. "Whenever i look at my hands, close my eyes... Nothing.. happens." said Leviente.

"AAAAAH! Paano na??" said Lauvielle, panicking.

"Hey, you see someone? Out the window?" said Leviente.

"Uhh" Lauvielle checks the window to see a human silhouette walking towards them. "AH! Yung guard! Surely they'll understand naman on why we're here?" said Lauvielle, panicking even more.

"Hmm, we will use persuasion! And language! That will be enough to convince them!" said Leviente.

"Hehe..." said Lauvielle, dying inside.

A voice is heard from the other side of the cardboard wall. "Hey? Uh, anyone there?"

"Ahem, Yes! We are only here to stay until the snowstorm stops, can we stay here?" said Leviente.

The voice answered, "Yeah, sure. I don't even know where the previous owner was..."

"Wait? Previous owner? When did you get the ownership of this guard house?" said Lauvielle.

"Yep... Some guy gave me some map and ring of keys. Then disappeared to the town. I went here, following the map." said the voice.

"Nice. You have like, a way of outstanding the cold or something? Because you.. have been standing outside the entire time..." said Leviente.

"Oh no, don't worry, I have heating powers and.." as the voice said that, immediately the windows and the open way behind the cardboard closed and the room was filled with hot air.

"-I also have a remote... Sorry! I forgot to tell you that!" said the voice, sounding a bit apologetic.

"Phew. Uh can you help us store the cardboard?" said Lauvielle as she was putting away cardboard.

"Sure!" said the voice, as they helped along with Leviente. Lauvielle and Leviente saw what they looked like, a girl that looked about the same age as them, wearing a hoodie.

"Oh hi! I am Jomi, the princess of the dark. But right now, i am on a quest to go to the queen of this land!" said Jomi.

"Hmm, she looks like someone..." thought Leviente.

"Hi! Jomi! So, how is your kingdom?", said Lauvielle.

"Eh, its... Fine? I didn't really get to do much until I heard of... trouble in this kingdom and so decided to help." said Jomi.

"You by any chance know who, Mijo is?" said Leviente.

"Yep! He's my... friend. Speaking of which, you guys have anyone else with you?" said Jomi.

"No! Only us. Weird." said Lauvielle.

"What do you mean by 'weird' Lola?" said Leviente

"Hmm, isn't it like— because I saw JR's opinion change towards Jamise, but before _'nawala'_ siya, he always said something bad about her, so I think that they met each other. But what's bothering me is how they left the chemlab..." said Lauvielle, looking for the first time in the dark world, to be thinking hard.

"Hmm, correct ka lola. But that means we are in the same world as them?" said Leviente, now also thinking hard.

"Eh, sure. But the rooms are different..." said Lauvielle, speculating about the nature of the magic.

'Ehe... Guys! There's no need to.. speculate! I can answer al- i mean most of them! So your assumption is almost right, they went out of the chemlab, without any darkness anymore. The current one, is.. in the room you went in and they have some of the same properties but the rest is wayyy different." said Jomi.

"Ah, so- you know a lot more than us! Obviously, how could i forget!! Ugh, you literally introduced yourself as a princess, I should have known about this..." said Lauvielle.

"Hehe, you're forgetful lola... like a..." said Leviente before getting cut off.

"Ulyanin?!? Eh- you didn't see it too ah!" said Lauvielle, annoyed by Leviente's statement.

"Well no lola, but.. you didn't as well hehe..." said Leviente, trying to end the joke.

"Ugh... Anyways! So hmmm, ay! May snow pa?!?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, interesting... Never ending Snow..." said Jomi.

"WHAT?!! NEVER-ENDING?!!?" shouted Lauvielle.

"Only a guess...  I'm going to look at this more. Y'all just like... Chill i guess." said Jomi.

"Ok then, thanks, Jomi. I'll see you later!" said Leviente.

"See ya' " said Jomi, before going out to the freezing snow.

As our duo talks about random stuff, the lightners in the light are a bit worried.

"Finally! Done na yung quiz! What's your answer at number 5?" said JR.

"Eh, B? I didn't understand much eh..." said Mijo.

"B?! Ay... Baka wrong ako! Check ko nga-" said JR.

"HEY GUYS!!!" shouted Jamise, strutting towards them.

"hey.. jamise.." said Urda, weakly.

"So, i saw that wala sina L and V dito so yung only way ay-" said Jamise.

"If they went to the dark world..." said Urda, now gaining a bit more vigor after realizing that.

"Ay oo nga! Let's go towards them, to.. to skip class!" said JR, now very excited and smiling.

"May quiz nga later eh, tara!" said Mijo.

"Where are we going..?" questioned Urda.

"Ay! I heard that they go to the 8-ruby room near the grade 7 often!" said Jamise, excitedly telling them about it.

"Yes. I can confirm." said JR.

"Alright! Let's go on another adventure!" said Mijo.

They all walked out of the room and as they were doing that, their classmates were curious why...

Fexili went to Rhida and said, "Hey, uh you know where those 4 are going? They seem excited..." said Fexili.

"I.. don't know, actually, I have been wondering where Leviente and Lauvielle are though.." said Rhida.

"Well, let's go! It can't be that... secret. Uy~ You'll meet with Mijo again! Face to face~" said Mack.

"Heh.. yeah.. ok, let's go!" said Rhida.

So Mack, Rhida and Fexili followed the group to the 8-ruby room..?

"Hmm..? Do they have like 8-ruby friends to meet?" said Rhida.

Then Mijo opened the door and some sort of black smoke was spewing out of it..?

"Huh? Ano yon?! Eh, Should we help them?!" said Fexili.

"Let's go there, they don't seem to be scared by... THAT." said Mack.

As they ran to them, Jamise went inside, then JR, then Urda, then before Mijo could jump...

"Hey! What are you guys doing?! That looks dangerous!!" said Rhida.

"Oh shi- I did not expect you guys here... Ehhh you guys could join? If you want to? But I have to go, they're waiting for me..." said Mijo.

"Huh? What do you mean? Like-" said Fexili.

"Hey! Wait, this looks deep..." said Mack.

"Guys! Don't worry! It's gonna be fine, look, it's fine if— you guys don't wanna come with me, but I— I— have to go! Adiós!" said Mijo before jumping in.

"No! Wait!" said Rhida before slipping down the darkness.

"Rhida!" said Mack as he tried to grab Rhida but got dragged into the dark.

Fexili tried to grab Mack too, but apparently they both fell to the dark as the door closed behind them.

Rhida woke up in a snowy place, pretty snowy. But as she came to her senses, she saw a huge gate and a guard house nearby reminiscent of her school. So she walked towards the guardhouse because the gate there was broken, for some reason, then she knocked on the door.

"Hello? Anyone there?" said Rhida.

"Hey- Wait a minute..." said Leviente.

"Aren't you Rhida? If so, welcome in!" said Lauvielle as Rhida came in and they closed the door.

"Hey yeah, uh why do you- actually, why do we all have medieval winter-like aesthetic clothes, I know it's snowing, but- that doesn't happen in the Philippines... Right?" said Rhida.

"Well, that's because... Ugh, do i have to explain to you what we just discussed earlier?" said Lauvielle referring to earlier.

"We? Like, you and Leviente? Yeah, you have to.. I don't even know why it ended up like this..." said Rhida.

"Y'know we have to keep explaining this to.. actually, how many did you go with, or is it just you?" said Leviente.

"Hah? Well, I saw Jamise, JR, Mijo and Urda come here? I guess.. then there was me, mack and fexili.. that's all i can know, did you see them here?" said Rhida.

"Well, we're not sure, we did see a couple of silhouettes go through the snow, but other than that, no— not anything confirmed." said Leviente.

"Huh! That must be them, but why was I delayed..." said Rhida.

"Hmm, you did come with people, right? Did you get separated or something?" said Lauvielle.

"I.. well Mack let me go, i think before being blinded by the darkness?" said Rhida.

"That's probably it, we were waiting for Jomi, but uh, I'm sure she will introduce herself.. Oh by the way, did you see anyone around here?" said Leviente, looking resolved.

"No, that's why I went here eh..." said Rhida, looking a bit more worried.

Then suddenly the door opened behind them and Jomi was back, and with an artifact...

"Hey— Oh hi there!" said Jomi.

"Hi—" said Rhida before looking at her face. She immediately stopped and thought "Huh, why does she look like..."

"Oh a bit surprised, sorry! Didn't know you guys were talking, anyways, I'm Jomi, the princess of the dark, now the guard in this, somewhat warm guardhouse." said Jomi.

"Oh hi! Jomi, what did you find? Does it finally solve the snow issue?" said Lauvielle.

"Well, kinda. I found this artifact which controls the snow in an area for a time. It is powered by its user. Watch, and come outside." said Jomi.

"Hehe, let's see.. After the demonstration, can i have a try?" said Leviente.

'Sure! Just make sure it doesn't get lost! I think i saw a few more, but we can get it once we get there." said Jomi.

"Wait- how many? My.. other friends are here but they have no artifacts.." said Rhida.

"Can confirm, they were definitely braving the cold when we saw the silhouettes..." said Leviente.

"I— I don't know, we'll have to see if this artifact even works anyway.." said Jomi.

"Right.." said Lauvielle.

As Jomi activated the artifact and controlled its power, suddenly the snowstorm around her started to wane, and eventually, it was gone. Only snow in the ground remained, and as she moved around, the snow dissipated along with her.

"Nice, it worked! Can i try? Though, there's no snow here anymore.." said Leviente.

"Well, no snowstorm but there's still snow, so you can try there?" said Jomi as she hands him the artifact.

"Wow, what do you call this? Or is there a name?" said Lauvielle.

"Hm.. Now that i think about it, there was something written on those papers, i guess we can check those?" said Jomi.

"What were they???" said Lauvielle.

"Uh, they were written with something, though I had to go quickly since the area was a bit dangerous.." said Jomi.

"Well, let's go there then! You'll just have to follow us, Leviente. and Rhida too! hehe.." said Lauvielle.

"Oki, oki.." said Leviente as he fiddled with the artifact.

As they went through the winter, as the artifact only stopped the snow in a specific area and only for a while, they walked into some people.

As they went through the winter, each had their set of winter clothes. Lauvielle had her sweater, Leviente with his winter coat, and Rhida with her jacket. Jomi was of course using her fire magic to heat herself, as if she also wasn't wearing a hooded jacket. After a while of walking, they came across some people.

"Uhh, how do we use spears?" said Mack, trying to hold the spear properly.

"I don't know either! It's not like I ever used a spear when I went here." said Mijo, helping Mack and Fexili with their fighting form.

"Hi Mijo! Welcome new adventurers! I am Jomi, a prin—" said Jomi, before getting cut off.

"Yeah, yeah. No need to tell them, I have already told them about you, Jomi. But uh—" said Mijo, before looking behind her and being surprised by Lauvielle, Leviente and Rhida.

"—ah! Right. I should have known. Uh, y'all want to go to this cave? It's pretty dangerous, so I sent the others and stayed behind to try and train these two." said Mijo, looking at each of them as he talked.

"Oh yeah sure! I just went there, did you go inside? Because I think you can recognize the symbols on the papers there." said Jomi, now looking towards the dark cave.

"Oh.. no. I stayed behind when I heard noises from that cave. Hmm, well now that y'all are here, I can go now. As aside from their 'training'.. I'm only really here so that they won't die due to unforeseen threats." said Mijo, now preparing his items and weapons.

"Ah— sure! We'll stay here then. Uh if you can, tell the others that we need as much of these," Jomi shows the artifact. "so that we can survive the winter."

"Sure! Anymore words before I go?" questioned Mijo to everyone listening.

"Hey.." whispered Mack to Rhida.

"Heh? Oh, uh what?", whispered Rhida back, surprised by Mack and Fexili now behind her.

"This is your chance, now we know you're safe, you can take this opportunity to... go with Mijo!" whispered Fexili to Rhida.

"Heh? Isn't it all a bit too fast? Shouldn't I like.. think about it, then go and chase him to the cave, alone?" said Rhida, with a hint of sarcasm in her words.

"Well, that's why we're here! Come on, Mijo looks like he's about to head off. So say it!!" said Mack, looking excited.

"Oh uh, fine!!" said Rhida before mentally preparing herself to speak up.

"Anyone? Ok, I am going now—" said Mijo before getting cut off by..

"Wait! Uh, can I go with you? I— I have experience in.. fighting! So I'll be fine.. No need to carry me!" then Rhida muttered, "if you want to.. I am not complaining.." before saying "Ahem, yeah..."

"Oh, sure. What were you saying before you coughed again? I couldn't hear it..." said Mijo, as he looked in her direction.

"Oh! Uh, nothing! Let's go already!" said Rhida, looking and sounding excited.

"Ok..?" said Mijo, as Rhida and him went down the cave.

At first, they were silent, as expected since enemies could be anywhere, but there were rocks, then more stone, and then they saw a group of people gathered at a specific place.

"Hey!" called out Mijo, as Jamise turns around and greets back, "Hi!!"

"Oh, so have you all found the 'artifacts'?" questioned Mijo as he and Rhida got closer to the rest of the group.

"You mean these? Yes, we have. In fact, we grabbed every single one, here, a note that seems to be baybayin, you can probably decipher this." said JR, before giving him a note that has some baybayin script in it.

'The Mountaineer's Timepiece'

"Hey, wait.. Why is it in English? Like, baybayin is for Filipino, and yet.. This is just a transliteration of an English phrase!" said Mijo, as he translated the baybayin.

"Hmm, that is weird, mam did tell us that filipino is the main language, but uh it's something to do with mountains??" said Jamise, confused over the naming and name of the timepiece.

"Because, mountains have cold tops sometimes?" said JR, thinking about the timepiece's name.

"True, but why english...?" questioned Urda, as she thought about the nature of the world.

"That. Exactly, it's not like we were ever foreign to English names, but for a dark world to have it, it's weird..." said Mijo, now taking some of the artifacts and putting them into his pocket.

"Uh, guys.. What if we ask the hooded girl, Jomi, right?" said Rhida, looking at Mijo, before looking at the group.

"Ohh! Right, sorry guys. Jomi is actually here, we just need to go back up, she might know something, at least enough to have an idea.." said Mijo, now looking behind him, seeing the darkness that surrounds the group.

"Wha—" said Jamise before, "That settles it. Let's go." by JR as they all start to prepare to head back up.

As they headed up, they encountered lots of enemies, mostly abyss soldiers, defending the cave that the timepieces were until a boss enemy showed up...

"Stop your ceaseless fighting, and bow down to the _abyss_! " said a random abyss general that was now blocking their path.

"Alright, how about... no?" said Mijo, now confident enough to taunt enemies.

"Be careful Mijo, I have a lot of artifacts with me, so no healing until we go up.." reminded JR to Mijo, as they stood opposite of the abyss general.

"What? Damn it. Too late.." said Mijo as the abyss general tried to stab Mijo before being deflected by Jamise's shield.

"Hehe! Now, as long as the five of us are here, nothing can stop us!" said Jamise, as she fired a blast towards the Abyss General.

"Summon, summon!" shouted the abyss general as tens of abyss soldiers and monsters appeared.

"Uh oh—" said Urda before having to dodge from a nearby abyss soldier.

"I will go to the general, y'all stay here and get them off my back!" said Mijo, before quickly dashing straight for the general.

"Wait!" shouted Rhida, as she ran a bit to only see Mijo face off against the general.

"Hey! Oh no— Rhida! Be careful, go to us now! Mijo will be fine!" said JR as Urda and Jamise fought off the monsters near them.

"I have to go! He is _not_ doing well!" shouted Rhida back, as she saw Mijo get straight up surprised with a hail of arrows and direct slash from the abyss general, getting him to slow down, resulting in him being injured.

"Ahh, I told him to— ok! I trust you!" said JR as he focused on blasting some enemies behind Jamise.

"Uh— Now how to save him— Ah!" said Rhida, trying to dodge the other abyss soldiers. She ran to Mijo's position as quickly and carefully as she could be, then before she almost got to Mijo...

"Got you! Lightner scum!" said the general as she got slashes in her forearm, causing her to fall next to Mijo, bleeding.

"Ah! Ugh, *coughing* IT HURTS SO BAAD!!" shouted an injured and bleeding Rhida, as she moved herself closer to Mijo.

"Wake up, please!! I'll... kiss you if you do.." said Rhida almost jokingly, as she stared at Mijo's face, almost unconscious.

"Huh? Hah? Oh, right.. JR can't heal just yet.. Rhida? What.. are you doing here?" said a weak Mijo, seeing Rhida almost cry.

"I am here to help you! JR and friends are already trying to distract, and.. the general.. where is he.." said Rhida as she begins to feel the sleepiness that comes with losing blood.

"The General?! He— that bastard! Hey, you have powers right?" said Mijo, as he gets up, slowly.

"Hah? Powers huh, I.." said Rhida before she closed her eyes.

"Hey! Wake up, don't die now! Just.. focus on yourself, focus on your magic, a.. way to get back at him!" said Mijo, as he stared deeply into the flickering eyes of Rhida.

"A.. way? To.. avenge? Yes.. for you.." said Rhida as she tried to get her magic.

"And, your friends! JR, Mack, all of them! You can't die here.." said Mijo, as the adrenaline wears off and he starts to fade too.

As the two barely manage to get their words out, the three have been trying to distract the general, as one look away from them could mean that the two die instantly.. However, Rhida finally starts to feel something..

"I.. feel cold." said Rhida as she got up, looking numb and determined, with the wound she had covered in ice.

"Y— You!" shouted Rhida as she looked at the general distracted by the three.

"Oh? I see, you—" said the general before getting blasted by the three, but he manages to hold his ground.

"Rats! I will make sure you all are confirmed dead!" said the general as he went straight to Rhida.

"Winter... Storm!" shouted Rhida as she cast a hailstorm of ice and snow, freezing the nearby enemies and the general, allowing the three to blast him a lot.

"I'll be finishing this!" said Urda as she teleported next to the general and shouted, "Hehe, Golden Wind!" as she slashed and shot the general breaking him into many pieces, forcing the other unfrozen abyss soldiers and monsters to retreat, for the frozen however, they were taken down by the other two as Rhida fainted again, having done her vengeance. The three picked up Rhida and Mijo, bringing them near the entrance of the cave, where they both woke up as soon as Jomi and the others saw them.

"Oh my— What happened here?!" questioned Jomi as she worries and heals for the two injured lightners.

"I.. don't wanna admit it, but I got outplayed.. *coughs* It's all because of... Rhida and the others that we got here alive.." said a weak Mijo, as he was helped sit on a makeshift wooden chair.

"Even geniuses have their limits, don't worry, Mijo." said Leviente, making a quote up from some book he read.

"How about you Rhida? Are you fine?" questioned Jomi, as she notices and heals the big wound on her forearm.

"I.. uh.. I am fine, um— The group has a question though..." answered Rhida as she was helped to sit on another wooden chair.

"I... notice that you have unlocked your magic... It's Ice, isn't it?" questioned Jomi, as she senses Rhida.

"Uh.. yeah, yeah.. W— Why?" said Rhida as she looked confused and nervous.

"I just... have a feeling.. Anyways, can you walk? I want to speak to you.. privately." questioned Jomi to Rhida, looking troubled.

"Uh.. S— Sure.. Uh.. how about them?" questioned Rhida, as she pointed to the rest of the group. Urda, Jamise, JR surrounding Mijo, Leviente and Lauvielle talking about something,  and Mack and Fexili, walking around.

"They'll be fine, we'll be fine, as long as _she_ isn't here, yet anyway." explained Jomi as she helps get Rhida up.

"Who is she?" questioned Rhida as they walked to a more private location.

"The queen, we didn't have time to discuss it but.. it will be later, with the group. They deserve to know. I have.. another question, what was your first impression of me? Answer truthfully." questioned Jomi, as both of them stopped and looked at each other.

"I.. well.. you did just help me recover.." said Rhida before taking a huge breath, then saying, "You.. look like Mijo.. but girl version? Like from the face, to the words, and even the knowledge... Is.. that it?" said Rhida, now looking embarrassed, looking at the floor.

"I.. hmm. I guess, I should share my secret then. I.. always noticed how they compare me to Mijo, and that is... fine. We are the 'same' anyway—" said Jomi, looking serious and calculating.

"What?! He— Do you mean it?!" questioned a surprised Rhida, now pleading to Jomi.

"*Ahem,* I am an extension of Mijo, even though I don't share memories with him here in the dark world, I think.. do you know his pink notebook he carries around?" explained Jomi, now staring at Rhida.

"Ah, yes? He sometimes writes in it, probably his diary, what does that have to do with you?" questioned Rhida, as she composes herself a bit more.

"I am that notebook. Since us darkners always has an equivalent in the light world y'know, skeletons are skeletons, et cetera." said Jomi, as she now shows a replica of the pink notebook Mijo had in the light world.

"Woah, I didn't know that! So, uh.. Since you are technically but not really him, y'know what he likes and stuff?" questioned Rhida, getting straight to her idea.

"Hehe, now that's complicated.. Guess I should help you and myself. Hmm.. He.." said Jomi, looking to Rhida.

"He.. what? Tell me, please! I promise I will do good with it.." said Rhida, looking excited in anticipation.

"He's single, and can be taken. Find out his hobbies, personality and secrets for yourself. You'll need to work hard for it." said Jomi, now smiling.

"Ah.. Better than I expected! Thanks Jomi so much! I promise, ok? Next time, I'll tell you everything, I will keep your secret." said Rhida very happily, looking around to make sure no one hears them.

"Good, the others will probably come and get us now. Just, try not to be too excited now, hehe.." said Jomi as she looks behind her and sees Mijo and Mack coming to their position.

"Hey! Jomi, and.. Rhida.. We're having a group meeting, and they need you all to be there!" shouted Mijo, as he scanned the area.

"We're coming! Go back, we'll follow you!" responded Jomi, as they began walking back to the camp.

"Ok! We'll be going— Huh? You wanna speak to Rhida? Sure, Jomi, come on, you had your private talk." said Mijo, as he listened to a barely hearable Mack whispering in his ear.

"Sure! See ya'!" said Jomi, going with Mijo as Mack ran to Rhida.

"Hey Rhida! So how are you? Are you fine?" questioned Mack as they followed the two to the camp.

"Y— Yeah.. Um, so I just got a deal with Jomi to tell me everything about _him_, y'know?" said Rhida, as they walked.

"Oh nice! How are you sure that she is telling the truth? I mean, she could tell anything, right? and why would she?" questioned Mack, as they stopped near the group.

"I.. can't tell you, it is pretty important for her and him, and she said to not tell anyone." explained Rhida, before both of them got closer to the group.

"I.. don't get it, but I understand.. It is between lovers, as they say." said Mack as they went near Fexili who was talking to JR about colors.

"Oh, Mack and Rhida are here, alright let's start this... Jomi! You start!" said JR to the group, looking to Jomi for some answers.

"Uh, *ahem.* Hello everyone, I.. officially welcome you to the dark world, and.. uh what do you all call this group?" said Jomi, now smiling.

"How would I know, I only just joined!" said Lauvielle, clearly joking.

"Jomi... We're called.. the.. Mijo! What's the name of the gc again?" said JR as he now directed the attention of the group to Mijo.

"Uh, dark world for lightners? That's not a good name now, since it's for us, _including_ Jomi." said Mijo, now thinking of a name.

"Hey, hey... How about 'The Dark Pearl' since, y'know?" said Urda, nervously smiling and looking to Mijo for help.

"Great name! Ok, that— Jomi! Why don't we move on now that we have a name?" said Mijo, now shaking and staring at Jomi.

"Ok, sure. The Dark Pearl it is! Now let's move on to the next one, so.. before anyone asks any questions, I am going to say the gist of this world so that everyone's on the same page. So—" said Jomi, as she looked around the group with mixed feelings.

"Ohh! Sorry, but.. Urda wasn't that a reference to a pirate movie?" said Jamise, as she playfully makes a face to Urda.

"Y- yeah... Can we move on now? thank you..", said Urda, as she began to slowly hide behind JR.

"Hey—" said JR, before Jomi continued, "*Ahem,* yes.. That's a good name, congrats Urda. But uh so yes, so this world is cold, a never-ending winter, as I said earlier to the three—" Jomi points to Rhida, Lauvielle and Leviente, "—only these artifacts can stop it, and not even permanently. That's why we need to speak to the queen, as she probably has the dark fountain somewhere and she holds the knowledge that will save this world from eternal winter." explained Jomi, as she dumps a lot of info on the group.

"Oh so we basically just need to go to her and ask for help? Simple enough, come on guys, let's—" said Jamise, as she excitedly waited for the adventure to fully start.

"Yeah, but we have to consider all of the possibilities, based on the info from Mijo and Urda, the first world was hostile, the second was hostile, turned friendly, and so the third one will likely be friendly, turned hostile." said JR, as the group discusses the next leg of their journey.

"Ohh! Ah wait we can't forget what we saw down that cave, Jomi, what is the meaning of this!" as she holds the paper that holds the name of the artifact.

"Uh, oh right! Mijo, could you translate it again?" questioned Jomi to Mijo, as the group discussed things.

"Ugh, hmm yeah still is 'The Mountaineer's Timepiece'..." said Mijo, looking disappointed.

"Hmm, interesting.. The 'Mountaineer'?, according to the archives, she was a lightner, who before disappearing forever, created the Set of Neverending Winter, which are 5 artifacts that have a way of fighting against the cold." explained Jomi, as the group listened.

"So you mean that there are more than the timepiece? Oooh new treasure!" said Jamise, now getting even more excited.

"Is this the lore part, because... zZZ _sleeps_." said JR, as the group discussed the city.

"He— Hey! I thought _you_ were the responsible guy?!" said Jamise, looking at JR.

"Uuh, oh? Yeah, but I am kinda getting bored because we've been here for 15 minutes talking, and not fighting. Also, I think we know enough to be fine." said JR, as he looks at his knife.

"We're almost done, ok? So what I can conclude is that there is a kingdom here ruled by a queen that met a lightner named the mountaineer then together they tried to solve the cold until that lightner disappeared and now the abyss, us and the kingdom are now trying to get the artifacts. Any other questions?" said Jomi, before Mijo answers, "No! Please, Jomi..", then Jomi nodded to the answer, indicating that discussion was over and now the group exhales, their history discussion over.

"Wooo! Can we celebrate with some drinks, I brought some!" said Mijo, bringing out RoyalCo drinks.

"Yeah! Umm, you have some water?" said Rhida, trying to not drink too early.

"Yeah, fair enough.. I'll save these drinks for later, here. Water, helps ya live." said Mijo, as he gives the group water.

"Wait, you brought water, how many? I.. barely have food items, much less drink items?!" said Urda, as she sips water.

"Uh, preparedness? Anyways, I have like 20 foods, 10 drinks with RoyalCo included and that's it. I didn't keep much as I am supposed to be fast, like you!" said Mijo, as the group finishes their break.

"Ok, let's go guys! Come on, probably more enemies ahead anyway.." said Jomi, as the group picks up their things at the camp and moves through the winter, keeping their artifact in hand as JR distributes it. They fight through hordes of abyss monsters, encountering no actual order members until they find a darkner fighting some abyss monsters.

"You monsters shall be extinguished under the emerald-ruby light! Die!" shouts an unknown darkner as they fight through abyss monsters.

"Hey guys, stop! An actual native, look!" said Mijo as he looks to the darkner fighting.

"Huh? Hey! Help me here!" shouted the darkner as Jomi and JR went and killed the monsters.

"Oh, thanks for that. Hmmm, ah! You appear to be Jomi, the guest of our kingdom, and you? Hmm—" said the darkner as JR interrupted and said, "I'm JR, part of Jomi's.. entourage. We are lightners, here to guard.. Miss Jomi."

"Oh! Right, she did say that. Well I'm Sasha, a silver guard, welcome to Dajovy! At least, the outskirts... I see that you were on the road of connection, which was the original place where our great queen met the mountaineer, I trust that you will be able to.. hold on, is he leaving?" said Sasha, as JR leaves and Jomi stands there confused.

"Uh, oh. Yeah he tends to do that, don't worry. He uh doesn't care about that type of thing that much, he's uh a straightforward guy I'll give him that." said Jomi as she and Sasha went to the lightners discussing something.

"Woah, like an actual friendly darkner other than Jomi? That's surprising." said Mijo, as Jomi and Sasha appear.

"Hey, so we can go to the city now, we just have to follow her, um her name is Sasha, in case you didn't hear that, she's a silver guard of Dajovy." said Jomi, as the group one-by-one greets Sasha.

"Ok, lightners! Oh, umm i meant, Jomi and her loyal entourage, I will personally escort you to the city. There are abyss monsters all around, but.." said Sasha before running out of words to say.

"We will be fine, right? We sa— I mean, helped you with those monsters, so we should be fine, right?" questioned Lauvielle, as Sasha thinks for a while.

"Uhh oh! Sorry, it's just nothing. Um, they probably won't do anything.. yet." said Sasha as she led them to the city.

"Huh? Who?" said Jomi, as she prepares her blade.

"Ahh! Sorry, sorry, I just.. ugh. I guess you would have found out anyway. The queen is heavily strict when it is about.. the civil war." said Sasha as the group's suspicions went down.

"The civil war...? Woah what the—" said Mijo before Jomi interrupts, "Oh, I can guess why.. Hmm, there was this sense of eerieness in the town, and then I heard blades hit as some guys fight. That was the fighting no?"

"Ah! So you would have known already! Uh, so sorry for doing that but it is the queen's orders, and I trust her majesty. Um, yeah basically that, I also realized that either her majesty or princess Jomi brings it up, so there's no point! Sorry about that, uhh let's go!" said Sasha as they continue walking down the path. The group talks about random stuff before arriving at the town.

"So, that is why I am right and you're wrong." said Lauvielle to Leviente.

"Nah, nope. Your evidence is not based on any reality and—" said Leviente before Jomi nudged them to stop.

"We're here, Dajovy Town. I hope you enjoy your stay! As for me, my mission was protecting the outskirts and I'll continue to do that, so see you!" said Sasha before going out to the outskirts.

"Huh, really courteous of that girl.. Hey! Where's your commanding officer?" shouted Mijo to a random silver guard.

"As part of the silver guards, I am obligated to say that you just met her, General Sasha of the 1st Corps." said the silver guard, as the group is shocked.

"Ah that's why... She was secretive about the information, because she's the general of the army here..." said JR as the group agreed.

"Well, let's head to their capital building, then. Um, where is it, silver guard?" said Jomi to the same silver guard.

"As you all are part of a foreign entourage, I am obligated to answer that it is literally straight ahead." said the silver guard, with a hint of sarcastic annoyance.

"Oh, sorry! Guys come on, it's literally straight ahead." said Jomi as the group ran to the building ahead of them that has a huge flight of stairs.

"Hello, me and my entourage are here for the queen." said Jomi as the silver guard looked at his paper, looked at Jomi then let the group pass through.

As they go up the stairs, the eeriness of the town begins to set in as the place is eerily quiet even though it's supposed to be a huge town. Eventually they make it up to the door, where two silver guards open up the doors to reveal the queen standing behind her desk, looking out of the window. They walk to where they were in front of the queen.

"Hello. You may call me, Svetlana, you may call me queen, but now I would like to be referred to as the supreme guardian of Dajovy. Now, let's talk about why, you are here. Lightners." said Svetlana as the group collectively grouped up and talked, then Jomi spoke up, "We are here because of the recent fountain and the abyss activities in this area."

"Oh, I see. The fountain, you say? You mean the darkness that powers this world? The abyss too, they have been affecting the.. situation around." said Svetlana as the group listened closely.

"Yep! So that is why I am here, to get rid of the abyss. The lightners are here to seal the fountain, it's for all of our sake, so trust me on this, Svetlana." said Jomi as the queen visibly shakes then stops suddenly.

"Hmm, sure. Just.. Let me take some lightners with me to the fountain, it is heavily guarded and so will need me." said Svetlana, as the group whispered between themselves.

"I see. I will personally lead this group, to gain more trust, as I am a darkner myself. I will bring.. Rhida, JR, Mack and Fexili with me. Mijo's group will take care of the abyss for you, just tell them where to go." said Jomi, as the group agreed with her plan.

"Sure. I agree with this plan, with one exception. Sasha must lead the other group. She will guide the lightners to the proper place." said Svetlana as the group agreed again.

"Ok, it is settled. Should we go now, or later?" said Jomi as Svetlana smiles but quickly returns to a neutral face.

"Now, would be best. I will send a silver guard to inform Sasha for the abyss group. Come, come with me, Jomi's group." said Svetlana before Jomi's group and her go outside and head to somewhere where Mijo can no longer see.

"Let's go outside too guys, Sasha might be waiting." said Mijo as the group goes outside and sees Sasha rushing to them.

"*Heavy Breathing* Wow, that was on short notice.. Hey! The queen— I mean the supreme guardian told me to accompany you so I am here, let's go!" said Sasha before dragging Mijo, forcing the group to move with her until they reach an underground subway station.

"Hey! Are we supposed to be here? This looks closed off..." said Mijo before they got attacked by unspecified armed people.

"Hey! Stop that! I will arrest you all!" said Sasha before a smoke bomb suddenly covers the entire area.

"Hey! Urda can you teleport and see anything?!" shouted Mijo as gunfire and swords clashed.

"No! I can't focus either, it's some sort of..." said Urda, before suddenly dropping down on the floor.

"Oh shi— Hey! Sasha!" shouted Mijo, as he saw Sasha about to fall.

"Ugh... I'm so sorry..." said Sasha before falling asleep.

"What? What's... ugh shi—" said Mijo before dropping down and sleeping.

"A deal's a deal... Sasha." said an unspecified female voice before Mijo fades into unconsciousness.

*Switching Scene...*

Mijo fades into consciousness as he hears two people argue.

"Look, It was either this, or you being hurt, ok?" said an unspecified female voice.

"Heh? Almost everyone saw it! Even the lightners... This was inevitable, why didn't you inform me?" said Sasha, sounding angry.

"We didn't have time, we knew that the queen was planning something and when you were trusted to go to an abyss spot, we knew where to go." said the unspecified female voice.

"WHAT?! YOU WERE SPYING ON ME?!?" shouted Sasha as she sounded irritated.

Mijo tried to look like he was sleeping, as he wanted to listen in.

"Oh? Um, I might have woken Mijo up.. Woops.." said Sasha as Mijo feels someone waking him up.

"Hey there, I am Natascha, a doctor in Dajovy. I have received your friends here, after a certain smoke bomb knocked out all of you. Though, you are the last one to wake up, as the others have gone into the town." said Natascha, as Sasha looks at Mijo apologetically.

"Um, sorry for waking you up, I just had a heated moment with Natascha here, uh... yeah.." said Sasha, as she looked down, feeling embarrassed.

"It's nothing, Sasha... I am just wondering... Where the hell am I? Because this place looks nothing like the buildings that I saw earlier." said Mijo as he looked out of the hospital window.

"Oh, right. Sasha, would you care to mention where we are?" said Natascha as Sasha goes near Mijo.

"So. what you see is the underground. A place where the people would usually mine emeralds, rubies and diamonds but nowadays it is closed off due to the abyss threatening the surface and the underground." said Sasha as Mijo begins to realize something.

"Hey, wait. Aren't you supposed to be an army general? If so, why are you here? How did you get beat up by—" said Mijo before Sasha spoke up, "I... I have a lot of issues with how the queen often ignores the abyss issue and keeps the fountain, even though the mountaineer disappeared a long time ago, and has probably not even cared for us.. But you, lightner.. You are the new way.. You seek to seal the dark world, from the abyss and yourselves.. A selfless goal.."

"Um, to be honest.. As much as I want to say it, It is selfish in some cases, we went into this world, expecting adventure. We got it. I do not know what is going through the minds of the others, especially the ones with Svetlana. But what I do know is that I have a duty to see this through, until the end." said Mijo, as Sasha and Natascha processed the information.

"Hmm, I guess that makes sense. I don't know what It feels like to have another world entirely different from mine, much less a world that I don't know.." said Sasha, contemplating.

"I also can make sense of Mijo's words. I have been to the library a lot as a child and I know what I would do, what I should do, but currently I am a doctor, and I have a duty of healing." said Natacsha as the door opened to see Urda and Lauvielle coming in.

"Hiii! Me and Urda just went on a bit of a walk and encountered some monsters, so we—" said Lauvielle before being nudged by Urda to stop as they saw the three looking out of the window.

"Oh? Well, I should get back to my doctor duties.. Sasha, you go talk with them." said Natasha before tending to some patients.

"Oh, uh don't worry! We were just discussing some things, um as you can see, Mijo is awake now, so we can go on that monster hunt now.." said Sasha, now grabbing her scythe placed near some medical boxes.

"Oh, sure. Um— Urda, you have anything else to say?" said Lauvielle, looking at Urda, as Urda was staring off at the general direction of Mijo.

"Uhh— No! Um... Except uh, yeah.. Jamise and Leviente, let's find them too..." said Urda, as the others nodded and they went out of the hospital, saying goodbye to Natascha.

As they went through the town, there is a feel of perseverance as they want to prove to the Supreme Guardian Svetlana that she was wrong and that they will save themselves. At least that was what Mijo was thinking as he saw the people hustle and bustle around the town.

"Wait, what's the name of the town?" questioned Mijo, as the group stopped.

"Oh, right. It's just called Pebble Town." said Sasha, as the two girls behind Mijo laughed.

"Heh? Pebble? Why? Is it like because the founders found a really important pebble or something?" said Mijo, sarcastically, smiling at Sasha.

"Oh, uh.. Natascha told me that the elders said it was because they mined rock and that they would store the excess rock into the town, and since some of it were pebbles, it was decided. Honestly, they should have gone with _Cobble Town,_ it sounds better." explained Sasha, as the three laughed more.

"Huh, well after this, I guess we'll have to request the Supreme Guardian to change that then.. Haha.." said Mijo, as they continued to walk to a nearby checkpoint.

"Hey, These guys are with me." said Sasha to armed guards, as they looked at the group nodded and let them in.

"Hey, what are the names of these guys anyway, like the org they work for?" questioned Mijo, as Lauvielle quickly tried to answer.

"Oh, me! I know this one, me and Urda were just walking around, and I asked a guy to tell me what the names of the armed people are, he said that those are Bonfire members, and I asked why, but.. uh they didn't know." said Lauvielle, as Urda and Mijo nodded, with Sasha turned away from them, contemplating.

"Hmm, yeah— yeah. That's— That's correct, I guess I'll have to ask Nat about that, anyways. Let's go in, we might find your—" said Sasha, before a voice is shouting behind the lightners.

"Hey! Hey! Sasha! N— I mean, Vlad has a situation, and he needs your help near the town plaza!" said the Bonfire member, as Sasha quickly dashes to his place.

"What is it? Some vagrants? Ask someone else, I am managing the lightners right now, is.. it that important?" said Sasha, as the lightners listen in quietly.

"It's not the vagrants this time, Sasha. It's a silver guard, and looks like an important one at that, I think when I left there were also some lightners there, so you have to go there!" said the bonfire member, as the lightners and Sasha were shocked.

"What?! Ok, I'll be going, send the message back, quick! I'll be taking the lightners with me." said Sasha, as the Bonfire member quickly leaves and the lightners go up to Sasha.

"We heard—" said Lauvielle, before Sasha interrupted, "Yeah, yeah I know. Come on! Before things get worse!" and they quickly started running to the plaza.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's group...*

"What have you done? Svetlana, this is dooming your world. You can't keep using the abyss magic forever." said Jomi, as she sees Svetlana using magic to control Mack, Fexili and Rhida from their exhausted bodies and JR barely surviving near her.

"No, you are simply blind to the _abyss_, you support the things that are keeping _us_ from truly being free, once the dark has taken over the light, then you shall see.. Princess." said Svetlana, as Jomi flinches and has a headache, trying to resist the abyss.

"Hey— What are you doing to her? Ugh, you know what, fine. I guess I'll have to kill you _myself_!" said JR, as he unleashed his dark power, damaging Svetlana a bit.

" _Chuckles_ Hmmph, a lightner using the abyss against me? You will never have full potential, _let's dance!_ " said Svetlana as she and JR fight.

*Back to Mijo and friends...*

"Hey, everybody stay calm, just don't hurt the girl, and you will be fine." said Leviente, as Jamise immediately says, "Yeah! You stay back! Or you're gonna get hurt!"

"Hey! What's with all the commotion here? I was called here by Bonfire, what's going on?!" said Sasha, as a bunch of vagrant assassins tried to surprise Leviente and Jamise, but were countered by the rest of the lightners and Sasha.

"Disappear into the dark, illusions of the past!" said Sasha, as she quickly cut down the assassins before anyone could react.

"Woah, she uh, she definitely is based on someone." remarked Urda, as the rest of Bonfire cleaned up and dispersed the crowd.

"Ah, as always, Sasha, quick and decisive..." said Vladimir, based on the clothing.

"It was nothing, Chief, just some basic deterrence, anyways... Who is the—" said Sasha as she looked over to see Anastasia, behind Jamise and Leviente.

"Hey! I demand to speak to your boss around here, I have been knocked out and was brought here, who did that? Huh?!" said Anastasia as soon as she saw Sasha.

"Oh, uh him!" said Sasha, pointing to Vladimir, now somewhat amused.

"Alright lady, you're not safe around these parts, Bonfire can only do so much, so you better stick to these _lightners_... As for your predicament, there were always people near the blockaded areas, I guess you ran into them and someone had to grab you down to the clinic?" said Vladimir as Anastasia calmed down and the lightners grouped up again.

"Ugh, fine. These.. lightners.. Whatever, just.. huh, um wait... **Sasha?!** You better explain yourself!" said Anastasia, as Sasha was caught off guard and was surprised.

"Uh, um. This is bad... Uh, Mijo can you do it?" said Sasha, as Mijo, slightly amused, agreed and went in front of Sasha.

"Ok, so uh... She told me that—" said Mijo, before Anastasia interrupted, "Oh! Wait— **Sorry!** I just thought you and my Sasha looked similar, Sasha is a common name anyway.. Um, what were you about to say?"

"Uh, we were going to say that, _whispers to Sasha,_ "What do i say??" said Mijo, as Sasha responded, whispering, "Uh, that... that... I know who the Sasha you were referring to and that we used to interact back then... yeah."

"She knows the Sasha you were referring to and that they were friends before she joined the silver guards. Yeah." said Mijo, as Sasha breathed a sigh of relief as Anastasia nodded.

"Ok, then. Ok, what do we do now?" said Anastasia, as the lightners, Bonfire and Anastasia gathered.

"Ok, so let's get back to what Sasha was going to do before this whole situation happened." said Vladimir, as some stared at Sasha.

"Um, we were about to head off into disputed territory with the other vagrants who set up there.. Why?" said Sasha as they now looked at Vladimir.

"Well, now we have gotten reports of... Misha's robots taking over the area. For some reason I don't know yet." said Vladimir, as the lightners were surprised by this revelation.

"Huh, robots? Didn't know you guys had those? Are they advanced?" questioned Mijo, as Vladimir smiled.

"Yeah, we have those... By advanced, do you mean enough to battle and support mining crews on their own? Because those aren't even the best, they're just the remaining ones." said Vladimir, feeling proud and at the same time reminiscent.

"Ok, we'll get all the time we want later, but this robot crisis, Chief, you remember what happened at Weld Town?"

"Yeah, anyways, so you, the lightners and the silver guard go ahead there. I still have to talk with.. the other members for some reinforcements and plans." said Vladimir before the others agreed and Vladimir said goodbye to the group before going with Bonfire.

"Ok, we should probably rest for a while, since even I need rest, hey why not take this time to talk with the others, Mijo?" said Sasha, as the group splintered to people sitting at the floor, the bench, standing, etc.

"Uh sure. How long are we staying here?" questioned Mijo, then Sasha answered, "Around.. I'll tell everyone when we go, ok?"

"Ok." responded Mijo, before Sasha lays down on a bench nearby and rests.

"Now, I am wondering what Jomi's group is up to, though now knowing that Svetlana is a bit suspicious at least, probably not good." wondered Mijo to himself, before going to Urda to speak about it.

*Meanwhile at the JR and Svetlana fight..*

"Huh?! How.. are you stronger than me?! You are a lightner, how can you maintain the abyss for so long?" questioned Svetlana, as JR pierced her heart forcing her to break control of her puppets.

"Ugh... Wait, what.." said Rhida weakly as she looked at the battlefield with Svetlana trying to heal as Jomi rose back up, and Mack and Fexili preparing their spears again.

"RHIDA! MACK! FEXILI! RETREAT!" shouted Jomi, as JR temporarily blinded Svetlana with an attack on her eyes, due to her lowered guard.

"OK!" said Mack and Fexili as they both went to Jomi, while Rhida started to fly with a touch of ice.

"What is she doing..??" said Jomi, as Rhida began to intensify the snowstorm around them.

"Wait, I know what she's doing, quick Jomi, retreat!" said JR, as he began to power up Rhida.

"What— Mack and Fexili, go! JR! You're exhausting yourself! As long as that fountain and the abyss haven't been dealt with, she will come back." said Jomi, as Mack and Fexili run for their lives.

"Well... We have you, Jomi." said JR, as Rhida unleashes 'Winter Storm' freezing Svetlana, as Rhida and JR both fainted, leaving the area quiet, as Jomi uses a bit of her powers to dash to Rhida and JR to get them to a better place.

*Back to Mijo and friends...*

"Yeah, she is a bit sus, like even if the problem is that she needs to take care of two threats, at different places, why doesn't she just send all of us and like Sasha on the way?" said Urda, as Mijo nodded, before Sasha went to them and told them, "Hey, let's go now."

They started heading to the place Sasha mentioned, however, Sasha was at the front, as none of the lightners remembered where they were and they were most concerned with Anastasia, who was worried about her safety as well as something else, as she was looking around, even though if she got attacked, her assailants would be disintegrated.

"Hey, we're here. Huh, Nat is here..." said Sasha as they saw Natascha talking with some miners.

"Hey Nat! Um, what's the situation..?" questioned Sasha, as Natascha finished her conversation and looked at Sasha.

"Oh, hi! So the situation is that some... Bonfire members are trying to talk to some of the vagrants as the robots push out the vagrants and.. Bonfire from the area." said Natascha, as the lightners listen.

"Oh, ok. Thanks!" said Sasha, as she goes to speak with the lightners.

"Soo what are we doing.. Sasha?" said Lauvielle, as Sasha thought about it.

"Let's go in. As one group, since Chief Vladimir, is probably sending to other areas, so let's just cut through to get to the robots, and the vagrants, to 'negotiate' with them." said Sasha, as the group agreed and went inside the great mine.

"Ok, let's go!" said Lauvielle, as the group went down the cave network, fighting robots and vagrants alike, until they reach some miners and vagrants fighting.

"HEY! y'all are in our territory, get out! Trust me, you do not want to challenge Bonfire around these parts..." said a miner.

"Heh, Bonfire? Aren't they getting their asses kicked with Misha's robots around 'ere? Besides there's no way—" said a vagrant as the group enter his sights.

"Looking for trouble, vagrant?" said Sasha as the vagrants got surprised by Sasha and her group.

"Ah! Bonfire, well I suppose we'll have to settle our differences, the hard way!" said the vagrant before they attacked the miners and the group.

The fight begins as Sasha shields the miners, and slashes the miners as Mijo and Urda stay behind, since they both know if they intervene, it's an easy win, and they want to see some action. Meanwhile Lauvielle and Leviente also stayed near them, as they had no powers yet, however Jamise decided to support Sasha by blasting some vagrants as well as shielding Sasha. After a fierce battle where Sasha got teamed up by the vagrants before Jamise casted an explosive spell which sent the vagrants running and the fight was over.

"Whew, that was tough! Though, honestly those vagrants where nothing, especially since we didn't intervene, y'know? Not ruin a new players experience, et cetera.." said Mijo, as Sasha goes to the miners to talk about something.

"Haha, guys? After this, I might not want to be going into these worlds, well— I could, but uh you guys have like super awesome magic and uh we still don't have ours, hehe so I might not be destined for this world..." said Lauvielle, as Leviente agreed and asked Mijo, "Hmm how do you get these powers? You said that most of the group here only got their powers through sheer will and desperation, like you when you were fighting those skeletons, or Rhida, when you told me she used her ice powers to save you?"

"True! But we still don't know much, Jomi said the same thing, and so far, that's what's been happening, I still feel like Jomi is hiding something again..." said Urda, as Jamise joins in and says, "Yeah! The power getting thing is weird! Like, really really weird, I got mine when I was fighting a huge statue of honrato!" as Lauvielle and Leviente audibly gasped at the words of Jamise.

"I.. I.. guess with the power of love, is how you gain it? I think?" said Lauvielle as Leviente added, "Two ways, friendships, as seen with Jamise and well romantic, with Rhida."

"Hmm, you're right. Well we better share this with Jomi, huh, is Sasha done talking to those miners over there?" said Mijo, as they look to Sasha talking with some miners.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's group..*

"Shi— I can't find the two, they must be somewhere here, still I am probably in great danger, I can't figure out if Svetlana sent the order out to kill all of us, or not, still I have to be careful, I have two unconscious bodies, and they might be in danger.. Hold on, how did they both utilize abyss power against Svetlana..? Whatever, that's a question I'll have to ask later, wait.. I think I see the two.." said Jomi, as she sees Mack and Fexili, having their spears out against unsuspecting silver guards.

"Hey! You stay back! I don't know what you did, but your leader tried to kill us!" said Mack, as Fexili looked around and saw Jomi hiding behind a house, peeking towards them.

"Hey, psst— Jomi's looking at us, I think she might not like us getting the silver guard's attention, quick let's just... uh how do we go invisible using magic again?" said Fexili to Mack as he listens in.

"Uhh let's just run! Yeah, I bet she can think of something, come on!" said Mack, as they both run from their current position to Jomi being disappointed at what they're doing but accepting it and looking to see if any silver guards are following.

"Hey! Jomi!" said Mack, as they both hide behind the building and Jomi casts a protection spell that projects that the alley they're on is empty.

As they both recover from their fast run, and look at Jomi, they see a tired and somewhat serious expression, as they look to see Rhida and JR unconscious.

"Ah!! Are they dead?!" said Fexili, as Mack goes behind him with a worried expression.

"Hmm, they're not dead. But their magic is completely spent. Using that amount of magic without a high enough stamina will do.. this. Like.. hmmm... You know when you feel so tired that all you want to do is sleep? That's what they feel right now, and with their use, natural regeneration might take a day or two to take effect—" said Jomi, as the two gasped audibly at this statement.

"However, I can heal them, it's just that I am already spending some magic protecting us here, and I was just recovering from the battle so.. we need to get back to Mijo's group, I am just wondering where they are right now..." said Jomi, as the two speculate, "We should probably look around the city, I think Svetlana said something about a place where Sasha knows, but where could that be?" said Mack, speculating on the words.

*Back to Mijo and the gang!*

"You're telling me, we're stuck here, because we can't repair a MINE CART??" said Lauvielle, as the group collectively stares at the minecart, broken and blocking them.

"Sasha might, but she's behind us with Anastasia, looking for something. I guess you guys figure it out? I am gonna look for them." said Mijo, as he heads off behind them and searches for the two ladies until he finds them picking out some scraps.

"What... is this?" said Anastasia, as Sasha picks up some parts of a minecart.

"This is a minecart piece, more specially..." said Sasha, before Mijo talks, "Hey! I notice that y'all have been here for quite a while. It's just that we have a broken minecart up ahead, and none of us know how to fix it."

"Oh, well this is just perfect. Princess, you'll finally understand how us darkners do things around here!" said Sasha, as she grabs another piece, and Anastasia visibly dismisses it like a pointless insult.

Then they head back to the group who managed to collectively push the minecart away and they see the three going near them.

"Stop! What are you doing?! Well, i guess even the lightners— don't know. Anyway, let me see..." said Sasha as she checked the mine cart, "The pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, the rear wheelset bearing too... Damn, definitely robot behavior. If i was them I would have just destroyed the whole thing.. Well, I got these parts, in handy. Now—"

"Wait! Guys, let's show that we can totally repair mine carts, Leviente, Urda, let's check it!" said Mijo, as he went near the mine cart to repair it along with the other two.

"U— Ugh. Fine... You better not waste those parts..." said Sasha, as the others watch the three try to fix it, and after a while, they did!

"Whew.. That almost broke. I— We are lucky." said Mijo as the two push the minecart away sending it through the opening, and letting the group pass.

"Yeah. This is a way of learning things, not just from school, but also from experience!" said Leviente, as Mijo and Urda nodded.

"Ok, ok, Leviente. Let's go!!!" said Jamise, as she dragged Lauvielle and grabbed Urda towards the exit.

"Haha! Coming! Hey, Mijo you going with them?" questioned Leviente, as the three were heard in the background, talking about something.

"I gotta talk to these two—" Mijo points to Sasha and Anastasia. "—you guys can survive, come on. You have.. Urda, and Jamise too, but she might be starting fights, so.. oh and Lauvielle." said Mijo, before they waved as the two darkners talked with Mijo.

"Your.. group. They are like me when i was a teen, always excited and going around being all 'cool' only to get dragged by my parents back home, hehe... Well, I guess I can only thank them for that." said Sasha, as Mijo smiled.

"Yeah. Teenagers, wait. Are you all, teens?" said Anastasia, as Mijo responded with, "Yeah, pretty much. It's their first time being alone and fighting like this, I mean, me too, but I've grown accustomed to talking more confidently and.. I hate to say it, maturely?"

"Hmm, I wouldn't say it like that, but I did notice how you were the leader, so you were more serious than your companions and that... Jomi. She seemed similar to you, but I couldn't say much." said Sasha, as Anastasia looks at Sasha.

"You mean Princess Jomi? Wait, I heard that she and the supreme guardian went to close the fountain, you think they succeeded?" questioned Anastasia, to both Sasha and Mijo.

"I.. doubt that. I just have a feeling, that either way I see it, it's a suicide mission." said Mijo, as Sasha nodded in agreement and said, "Yeah. Whatever plan.. Svetlana has, is likely leading them into slaughter, otherwise why would she.. hm."

"What? What's wrong?" said Anastasia, as Sasha suddenly remembered that she was trying to hide her true identity to Anastasia.

"Um.. like Mijo told me, they were separated into two groups, and as I see it, this was an excuse to kill off the other half while the others get distracted. Like in Mil... combat..." said Sasha as Anastasia looks at her smiling.

"Oh, uh we should probably go—" said Mijo before Anastasia interrupts, "Are you in a hurry, Mijo? I want to say something that I want you to stay here for.", Mijo nodded.

"I.. should probably say that.. Hey, Sasha. I.. know you're the same Sasha from the surface." said Anastasia, as the two were surprised by this.

"Wha— What??? What makes you say that??" Sasha whispers to Mijo, "Help me here!" Mijo responds, "This convo is more suspicious, I'll try but.. hear her out first, hmm?", Sasha begrudgingly nodded and listened to Anastasia.

"After the whole debacle at the plaza, and I sat down to recollect my thoughts, I immediately knew you were lying, but... I don't blame you, after all, it was tense. But as I realized this, at that moment I decided to keep it to myself and see what Sasha's 'friend' does in the underground. It was.. exactly how I remember you, and after we were alone, collecting some parts... I have decided to tell you that it's fine. You don't need to hide yourself. I.. I.. know what it feels to hide your true self in front of others." said Anastasia, as Sasha is silent, trying to process things.

Then, Sasha stops herself from almost crying, then says, "Y— Yeah.. Ok. Um.. Just.. um. Mijo uh.. can you wait a few more minutes? We have to talk." said Sasha, referring to Anastasia, as Mijo said, "Sure.. Uh, can I listen?"

"Yeah, fine. I already revealed my.. inner thoughts. So, it's fine. Just, hehe.. shut your mouth ok?" said Sasha, as Anastasia visibly notices this, but doesn't say anything, looking at Sasha instead. "Sure. Just, continue." said Mijo, as he listened more and turned his back, allowing them more privacy.

"Ok.. Uh. I am sure, you have a lot of questions, and.. I wanna know what they are, before.. saying anything." said Sasha, before Sasha nodded, and said, "Thank you, first, why did you join the silver guards? I.. remember what you said back then, 'for the people' is what you said, so.. can you elaborate?"

"Uh, well. It is true. I've always fought for the people, and saw how the civil war ruined any chances of this being true, I was disillusioned.. After Bonfire found me, they took me in as a member, as a spy. Now, this, what you're seeing is my old suit, the one I picked out before joining the silver guards." said Sasha, as Anastasia nodded.

"I see. I noticed, your fighting style, no matter if scythe or sword, you fight the same way, quickly separating you from other silver guards.  I.. have another question, did you.. live here, before the war? I.. have always lived in the palace... But something is familiar about you.." said Anastasia, as Sasha thought about it.

"Um, yeah. I lived here, and after joining, moved to the surface. I mean, I guess there were a lot of kids in Nat's orphanage... But.. I don't know what's so familiar about me, aren't you the daughter of Svetlana? Are you confusing our duty together with your childhood?" explained Sasha, as Anastasia visibly is questioning herself but continues.

"I.. *ahem* We'll see. For the last question, I.. wanna ask you, how did you get here?" questioned Anastasia, as Sasha thought of a way to say what she wanted to say, "Uh.. Just, I.. um. Well, same as you..."

"Ok I understand. We're fine? We can continue and support the other lightners, at least.. for now?" questioned Anastasia, as Sasha nodded and nudged Mijo to turn to them.

"Oh, uh. I see. I guess we can go now. Come on, those idiots might be fighting the boss robot.. Who is it again..?" questioned Mijo, as they started to walk to the rest of the group. "Misha, Vlad knew the creator of that robot, Mikhail, but he died due to the abyss and civil war happening. So now the robot is managing the remaining robots, and has adopted a girl, her name is.. Polina, I think?" explained Sasha as they saw the group looking over a drop, where Misha and Polina can be seen overlooking the mine.

"Guys! Shhh be quiet! Those look like the people Sasha was talking about.." said Lauvielle quietly, prompting the three to stop, and look at the two below.

"Look at this place, Polina. It has been time and time that humans have fought over this place. Between the blockade and the war, I must be set on making the underground a peaceful place." said Misha, as they looked over the main part of the mine, over the recently fought over land between vagrants and Bonfire.

"I understand, Mr. Misha, but.. how the others feel.. I am not sure they like what we're doing.." said Polina, as she contemplates the events happening.

"It is.. part of humanity that their emotions can guide them. But, as a machine, I must follow this rule, Polina. My calculations are what I follow and it is logical, based on variables already there." said Misha, as he heard a small rumble in a cliff near their spot.

"I suspect Bonfire has already made it here." said Misha, before Sasha appears dashing through and appearing near them. Then Sasha says, "Yeah, sure did. Now, leave— or.. I'll make you leave." 

"As a high level threat, you are a dangerous, volatile variable. But, for now, it is the best to leave this mine. More robot casualties for the sake of delaying the inevitable is not something I am programmed to do. Let's go, Polina." said Misha, as he gets a big command robot, to deal with Sasha.

"I trust you, Mr. Misha, Big Bert, protect our escape, ok?" said Polina, as Misha and her leave the mine, leaving the big robot to face Sasha.

"Really? Ugh... Hey! Lightners, help me here..!" shouted Sasha, as Anastasia, and Jamise dropped  down near her, spreading out.

"As a silver guard, I must protect and help fellow silver guards. So I am here." said Anastasia, then Jamise said, "Well, I am here to help fellow friends! That's all."

The robot looked at them and charged its chainsaw, presumably was used for logging, now used to battle against them. First, Sasha dashes in, using her scythe, blocking and attacking the robot, as Anastasia provided fire support. Jamise provided the shield to Anastasia, and also supported Sasha. From above, the others can be seen watching. 

"Hey, Leviente, you should get in the action, y'know, experience?" said Mijo, as they watched the fight. 

"Huh, good point. But, I don't think I can contribute much without any weapons..." said Leviente, before Lauvielle quickly said, "Hey, hey! Yeah— yeah, no need! It's *pretty* dangerous there, so.. just stay put.. hmm?", then she glares at Mijo.

Mijo looked unfazed but continued, "Yeah. Well, here—", Mijo gives his katana to Leviente, "—it's a good weapon, sharp and effective.", Leviente inspects the weapon, comparing it to his knowledge of swords.

"Um, lola... I think I know what Mijo's trying to say, so here—", Urda gives Lauvielle a cutlass, then as she inspected the sword, she said, "What's this.. oh, like.. a pirate sword..? Hey! I mean, a— aren't you two a bit worried we might.. die?"

Mijo and Urda looked at each other, then Mijo turned to Lauvielle and said, "Well, as I said, you can only get the powers through this, and well..", Mijo looks at the battle then looks at the two of them, "it's the perfect opportunity, so go!"

"He's right, lola. We should." said Leviente, before looking at the battle, "There'll be a lot of battles in the future. Let's start now.", continued Leviente. Lauvielle thought about it, then nodded, saying, " *big sigh* Ugh.. Fine..! You only live once...", before the two dropped down, supporting Sasha, with their limited combat knowledge.

They continued watching the battle below, as the five moved around the robot until Sasha decided to end it. "Disappear among the dark, illusions of the past!", said Sasha, before cutting through the robot in quick motions, the slashes making reality look like cut glass, before she stopped behind it, damaging it a ton, causing the glass to shatter.

"Hey! Why isn't it—" said Lauvielle before Sasha gets suddenly attacked by the robot, luckily she managed to deflect it with her scythe but she was pushed back to a wall, and was forced to retreat to Anastasia's side.

"What the... The bot, it's still working?!", said Sasha, as the bot turns to face the five in the same direction. "Due to the damage its taken, it's more aggressive and offense is stronger, at least, that's what I know about these robots.." said Anastasia, as the robot targets Sasha.

"Oh come on! Just because I am a Bonfire member?!" said Sasha as she deflects and dodges the robot, as it gets pummeled by the others.

"Should we.. intervene?" said Urda to Mijo, as they watched the five try to destroy the robot.

"Nah, if it's necessary, then we'll do, but it seems they're doing fine, no jinx! hopefully..." responded Mijo, as they quietly watched the five.

Then the robot decided to use its other hand, charging its blast at Anastasia, before Sasha went in front of her and blocked it, causing her great exhaustion.

"*Heavy Breathing* Oh shi..." said Sasha as she watched Lauvielle and Leviente double team the robot but they got countered and were pushed back. Then it decided to pressure Jamise who was getting tired.

"Oh no! Oh no! Guys! Help me here! I can't keep this shield up forever..!" shouted Jamise, as Lauvielle and Leviente attempted to distract the  robot again before getting pushed back.

"I have to— hhngh— Ah.." said Sasha as she tried to dash to Jamise, but her power was spent.

"Ahh!" shouted Jamise, as her shield broke, and the robot managed to almost knock her out using its chainsaw. "Ah... Your— turn...", as she attempts to heal herself discretely. The robot turned to Lauvielle and Leviente who were pretty much down, as they barely managed to stand and keep their blades close.

"Oh no! Mijo let's—" said Urda, before Jomi interrupted, "Yeah, you go distract it and we try to kill it! Go!", as they dropped down, and moved in seperate directions.

"Hey! Come here!" shouted Urda as she dodged and shot the robot, distracting it to her. "Hey, Leviente, can I have that back, oh and that too, Lauvielle..", as both hand Mijo their respective swords. Then he moved away from them.

"Hehe, time for some action! Big robot! *Let's dance!* " said Mijo, before joining in the fight. He used his katana and the cutlass to dual wield blocking and deflecting shots and slashes of the robot, as Urda supports using her modified pistol to quickly burst shots between dodges. However after a lot of fighting, suddenly Mijo messed up one block and got stabbed directly in the heart. 

"NO! MIJO!!!" shouted Urda, as Mijo barely managed to say, "Why— hn— does this always— ah! happen to me...?" as he fell to the ground with the two swords.

"THAT'S IT! NYAAA!" shouted Urda, as she dashed and got the cutlass as she shot and slashed multiple times, weakening the robot.

"Wait! Sasha, stay here." said Anastasia, as she jumped to immobilize the robot's chainsaw right arm, she jumped on its arm then she stabbed it, decommissioning its chainsaw arm. But the robot pushed Anastasia away, as she used all her power to do so.

"Hah! You're already dead! Golden Wind!" shouted Urda as she charged her ultimate, but as she did, with the robot's remaining power, it blasted Urda with greater force, she deflected it however it took all of her energy.

"Alrighty.. It's a.. little tough.. Hah..." said Urda, as she sat on the ground, left to watch as the robot tried to heal itself, deeming all threats neutralized.

*Meanwhile at.. Mijo's mind?*

" *Heavy Breathing* Ah, what the.. what is this? this.. looks like my backyard... And yet... WHY am I still stabbed?!" said Mijo, as he looked around and went near his sword, stabbed to the ground, like a sword stuck to a rock.

"Huh..? What..? This.. is my sword! I.. is this the afterlife?" said Mijo, as he felt the pain in his stabbed heart get stronger. "A— and that too... Ahh!!! Ugh...", he looked around for any signs of life, until a portal opened in front of him.

"Hi. I am—", the figure stopped and stared at Mijo. "Who.. oh.", said Mijo as he looked more attentively to the figure, and they were Jomi.

"Nevermind. You know who I am." said Jomi, as she goes near him slowly, with a serious look on her face.

"Uh.. Jomi..? You know where we are?" said Mijo, as he continues to look at Jomi, inching ever closer to Mijo.

"It is about what you can guess. Your mind, and this is a creation of it. But the reason you're not dead..." said Jomi, before she pulled out the chainsaw, making Mijo drop to the floor as a response.

"Ahh! *cough* thanks. I couldn't get that out.. So, um.. what?", as he turned to Jomi, who was behind him.

"Is... you possess a will, determination. That is so strong, it can resist death. 'Death' however, for you lightners only really means you can't wake up until a healer comes. But you, you possess the power to completely change this world, which is why you are part of the prophecy. As for her, I believe that's for another time." explained Jomi, as Mijo stared at her with astonishment as to her words.

"What..? So, like you have time now, to explain this to me..? Why?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi went past him, back to where she was and said, "Wake up, trailblazer. You can't die here, stay determined, Mijo.", before she left through a portal.

"No! Fuck.. She.. really.. ugh. I need.. to.. wake up." said Mijo, as he looked at his sword, then he decided to pick it up. "Wake me up. Please..?" said Mijo, before he wakes up in the landscape.

He sees Urda on her last legs, however the robot is also almost destroyed, so he focuses on it.

"Hey! Robot! Mwahaha! No. more. escape! You. shall. die!" shouted Mijo, before he dashed through reality breaking the speed of light, as he slashed through, breaking reality and forming broken glass as he slows down and sheathes his blade as hundreds of cuts destroy the robot to scraps.

Summary: School is a burden on these hopeful lightners to save the world... It would take an exam to stop them right in their tracks...

Author's Note: Basically all of my anxiety, frustration and stress from my school exams into this story.

After another dark world has been sealed in the computer lab, they decided to leave. As chances of anyone seeing them there were high and they didn't want to get sent to the principal or guidance office. So Mijo, Urda, and JR exited out to find Rhida, Leviente and Lauvielle talking at the tables near the computer lab.

Rhida said, "There's an exam!? But, we literally have the worlds to explore!"

Leviente said, "Exams... The NAT, E. Math and English, ICT, Math, AP, and others.. Also periodical exam next week."

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, lahat ngayon ay nakakabaliw sa isang tao!"

Rhida saw the other group and said, "O-Oh! Hello Balts!!!"

JR responded, "Hi Rhida! So-"

Leviente quickly said, "Yo, we should head back... 12:50 PM na!"

So they all rushed towards the classroom and opened the door to find their bags and the lights out. As they head for their bags and pack up,

Mijo said, "Uh, I can't believe we didn't contribute towards cleaning this classroom! Though the Garbage is still here.." as he sees two ziplocks filled with garbage.

JR said, "We'll just have to take it then, you Mijo, take one as well."

Mijo said, "Ok, ok..."

But as Rhida was about to leave, Mijo quickly approached her and convinced her to stay for one last announcement.

Mijo announced, "Uh, Urda!, JR, Leviente, Lauvielle and Rhida. Anyone here agrees to keep the dark worlds a secret- raise your hands if you agree."

All of them raised their hands. 

Mijo then said, "Good to know. Alright y'all can leave no-"

As he says that, Rhida and Urda rush out of the door being super late to their schedule. Eventually, Leviente and Lauvielle also leave and after that it's just JR and Mijo.

Mijo said, "Hopefully, nothing bad happens tomorrow and on friday, I don't really wanna deal with exams and saving the world..."

JR laughed and said, "Yeah..."

They left and closed the classroom as they left the school to go to their home, though their parents were not that happy. They understood that both of their lies that "Cleaning is hard you know?".

The next day rolls in, not much interesting happened as quizzes and pts were being done. But Mijo at lunch decided to look around for the next dark world but couldn't, thankful for this, he went back and studied and chatted along with the other students.

But something was brewing... *Darkness* will soon appear once again..

As ESP started, Mijo was just chillin' but as the NAT quickly arrived, his friends including but not limited to Urda, Leviente and Rhida went to the Computer Laboratory to begin their test.

Things were "fine" for the rest of the class as they waited patiently by reviewing many many notes but then Mijo began to think about the dark world again... He thought to himself that he should do this later, at home and night. Due to the exam LATER for him so he continued to review, hopefully distracting from the whole dark world stuff.

ICT came and he did the portfolio, it was tedious and boring but hey he did procrastinate last night to do the title soo yeah! (It was a cool drawing). After that, Mijo checked the clock and it was 2:33 PM. Near when they were going to the computer lab. It was time to study again and so he did. 

*Darkness spreads*

It was time to go. He and the others went to the comp lab and were told to sit at the nearby chairs and tables and they were 'reviewing' but not really as they weren't allowed to bring notes or phones so they just sat there and talked about random stuff until the roll call started..

Sir Joriec announced, "Ok, its time to roll call everyone here soo..." As he looks for the first name, "Caboc! Stand here.... Cala! Stand next to him!" 

Mijo had Cala as his last name so he went behind Caboc and the roll call continued until all were in a line and weren't blocking the pathway. 

Sir Joriec asked, "Hmmm, where is Rich, Delo Cuz, and.."

Sir Calas said, "Oh! They just arrived!" Pointing behind Sir Joriec. 

Sir Joriec said, "Ok... Rich! Stand there!" And the roll call continued

They waited as the first batch was finishing and getting out of the computer lab and getting their things. Urda was the first one and got out as soon as possible but then, Rhida, Mack, Leviente and JR burst out of the door and were talking though Mijo could barely hear them.

Rhida said, "How did you guys do??"

Mack said, "Very bad po!! Papunta na po ako sa Summer Class!"

All of them laughed.

Leviente said, "Ganon lang talaga pre-"

Rhida said, "Hey! Papasa ka kaya..."

Leviente said, "Ikaw din!"

JR was silent and was the first one to go to the classroom along with the others. 

Back to Mijo, he was slowly panicking and after they were allowed to go in, he sat down and started to log in. Some people were having problems for some reason but after 2 got kicked because they had no account, the test was started with a questionnaire.

*The day nears its end*

The questionnaire was kinda easy, honesty is the best policy they said, so he just answered mostly truthfully including the part where he would go to summer class which he answered no to.

*A test of knowledge and power*

After that, there was the English quiz which was kinda easy, but then Science's kinda hard and Math was especially very hard for Mijo but as there was dead air in-between he started thinking about the dark worlds but he decided to stay focused. 

*Soon, it will all end...*

After the quiz was over, he left seeing Vink and JR doing something in the computer lab. But he ignored it and instead quickly went to the classroom to grab his things. There he saw Leviente, Lauvielle, and Macu cleaning up.

Leviente said, "Lets go! Bilisan mo!"

Lauvielle said, "Wait lang kasi Leviente!!"

Leviente then saw Mijo and said, "Nakikita mo ba 'to Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah, also ano nangyari noong wala ako?"

Leviente said, "Uhh tignan natin, Wala kaming ginawa noong English... Nagquiz yung iba sa Math... Nag-chikahan lang kami tungkol sa Farewell Party... At si Urda lang ang naglinis noong time na!"

Then JR arrived and complained, "Bilisan niyo!!! Nagagalit na ang papa ko!"

Then CJ came in and started annoying Lauvielle.

CJ said, "B'at nandito ka Lola?"

Lauvielle responded, "Kasi CLEANERS ako!!!"

Though, they quickly cleaned up and started to leave. Almost locking Lauvielle but she left and so the door was closed yet again... By JR and all of them left.

After that, Mijo came home and slept like a sloth, and was up late doing tasks and thinking about the dark world...

Mijo said, "Today will be another day..."

DONE WOOOOOO

<!--Chapter 4 Part 2-->
<h2>C4p2 DeltaRambles: School Reality</h2>

Summary: Another Boring Day.... Friends say goodbye though...

Author Note's: Continued my addiction to this story. Hope i finish it! 

As the Panicked Mijo quickly goes out of his house and into the tricycle, he wonders if he had any missing... 

Mijo said "Oh! Math! The Brochure... I AM SCREWED if mam Maris arrives orr mam CK arrives early... Ok as soon as i arrive i will do it.."

So Mijo rushed to school, almost late again, rushed to the classroom, sat down and begins the rushed project. He sees his friend JR doing something with Fexili on the computer, Leviente and Lauvielle reviewing with each other, Urda writing some notes... 

Mijo muttered to himself, "Ok then, let's do this!"

So he rushed it, lucky for him, Mam Maris didn't come and he finished the basic outline and started designing, he got some impressions from JR but he kept going until Mam CK arrived...

Clameans greeted the teacher, "Good Morning! Mam CK!"

So after she arrived, Mijo quickly rushed the last logo and passed it before the review and the quiz. 

*1 hour later...*

After a science quiz that was noticeably easy, Mijo stood up, walked around with JR and went to Urda who was busy with the Science Quiz.

Mijo said, "Hah.. You checked your paper, yet di ka pa tapos!"

Then as he was about to leave, he was approached by Urda.

Urda said, "Hey! Ikaw nga magpasa nito.." pointing to her quiz paper.

Mijo said, "Ikaw kaya!"

Urda said, "No, ikaw! I'll.. just follow you!"

Mijo said, "Ok, ok! Fine, let's go!"

So they rushed towards the door but before that,

Mijo asked JR, "Papunta ba si Mam Dansie sa Faculty?"

JR replied, "Yeah."

So they got out of the classroom, ran out towards the faculty room, opened the door and asked,

Mijo asked, "Asan po ba si Mam Dansie?"

A random teacher replied, "Nagkaklase po!"

So Mijo closed the faculty door and saw Mam Dansie going towards them. So they ran towards her and Urda very awkwardly gave Mam Dansie the quiz before heading back to the classroom.

Mijo, after interacting with his friends, JR, Leviente and Lauvielle, sat down in his chair and did his portfolio as JR moved seats on his own.

At lunch Mijo thought "After that, lunch! But it was a depressing lunch, I had to review a lot of quizzes and no friends to talk to.. yeah and the worst part? I also had to check my Computer Performance Task for issues which means wasting more time... Pretty uneventful for a world like this..." 

People were distracting themselves, actually reviewing, doing some performance tasks and others.. A day so boring you wonder how nothing interesting happens..

*A connection weakening...*

ICT quiz came along and there was a specific direction that screwed people's heads.. It said to write their crush and favorite teacher as Negative or Positive respectively. People all collectively lost their marbles and started making fun of it.. Some people were joking about putting their friends or were begging the teacher to let them put the initials, last and first name, Mijo put their own FULL name and the teacher's FULL name as well. It was fun..

As the English Teacher didn't arrive and people were just chillin' Mijo decided to walk and chill near the human model and researched about the dark world, how it forms based on games and how they formed earlier.

JR approached Mijo and randomly told him his parent's backstory, manners and other random facts.. The rest, Leviente was playing "AirRobin" a air defense using bow and arrow and Lauvielle was watching him, Urda was playing games with Yeasa, a game called "OTile Extreme" in which you press in sync with the music, Rhida was scrolling through Lemit, and the others were also just chillin'

Then when it was time to go home, everybody in the clasroom said their goodbyes to eachother and left, as next week will be a busy and stressful week as a lot of tasks were due and exams were present and the next next week will be pretty much a farewell party so it was a moment for all of them including Mijo.

*An interesting goodbye, i say...*

Mijo returned home and rest, for it was work tomorrow, and Sunday.

Mijo said, "This is gonna be A stressful week and I WILL be suffering but hey, it's gonna be worth it in the end..." Then he fell asleep...

DONE YOOOOOO

<p id="C5"><md-block># C5: School Break?</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: Since its a review day... The 8-Pearleans are gonna review and finish their tasks right? RIGHT?!?

Author's Note: Super sleep deprived when making this one... 3 hour sleep before an exam is not good... Also I am wary of Mijo perspective being the most used but idk how to solve that? Also Taylor swift shenanigans in the future maybe? Also incomplete due to exams...

As Mijo woke up, sleep deprived, 6 AM... He remembered sleeping at 4... So he got up and started preparing for school..

He ran to the school and straight into the classroom, seeing Lauvielle and Skay on the way.

He entered the classroom, sat down at his chair and started to do his Science Portfolio but the FRC started and he headed out with JR.

Nothing interesting happened except that in the Student Government, Jamise didnt win P.I.O but  Klon did win Grade 9 Rep, so that was cool..

Mijo returned to the classroom and he did his science portfolio until he was done during filipino time in which:

He muttered to himself, "Wag kalimutan, pag mayrong nga taong nagmumukhang masaya, isipin mo ang taksil niya..." 

To a question Mam Payda had towards the students about a quote from Florante at Laura..

Before someone finally answered the question and he moved on. But another one! A bible question...

Mam Payda said, "Alam niyo ba yung storya kung saan meron ipinatapon na bata?"

Lauvielle responded, "Abraham po?"

Mam Payda said, "Hindi, yung may Mami na asawa?"

Then everyone collectively nodded, they knew it!

Mam Payda said, "Hmm hindi kasi yung may basket o yung pinatay lahat ng unang anak..."

After that, it was break time! So Mijo went out to go to the CR, little did he know what would happen...

As soon as he returned, he opened to see the dark world, yet again? It was weird, but not unlikely.. 

Mijo thought, "Still who would open here, was it one of the people who went with him in the dark worlds? If so, they couldn't know how to open it... Maybe the one that opens all the other portals? But I can't stand here... The only thing i can do now is..." Before he could second -guess himself he jumped in...

Things looked weird? Wasn't the same when he left...

Mijo looked around and said, "Wait! I see a city! Looks like our Biotech Lab Cabinets.. Imma go there..."

As he walked towards there, he saw large amonts of.. people. They were lightners! But if the entire class was here, then...

As he walked to the city, he saw a lot of people in different groups. First, there was Rhida and her friends, then Lauvielle and her friends with JR, then Urda and her friends and Leviente and his friends. 

Mijo then walked towards a big tower where there was a staircase, so he went up and up until he was up the tower and he saw a teen looking outwards of the tower. He walked up to that person and talked, 

"So, why are you here? All of the people are down under..."

The teen said, "Same thing i'd ask you."

Mijo said, "Well, who are you anyway? I don't recognize your face under that hood..."

The teen said, "Soon you will, but i have to ask you.. what are you doing up here?"

Mijo said, "I wanted to see what is up here... Who are you anyways?? I won't say anything until you show yourself. I dont trust anyone that isn't one of my friend's."

The teen said, "Well, if you must insist..." Then
they took off their hood to reveal a face so similar yet different...

"I am Jomi. A Princess of The Dark. I am without subjects but that doesn't matter... You lightners, i have been helping your journey secretly-"

Mijo cut off and said "So you were the one who killed those elite skeleton guards and the princess? Coool."

Jomi continued, "Yes. You must understand that a huge war will happen. You can stop it but it will take 3 light days."

Mijo questioned, "Light Days? You mean like 3 days sa aming mundo?"

Jomi responded, "Yes. I need you and your friends to prepare for it."

Mijo said, "Wait, this coincides with our exams... Ugh... Kinda wish this happens like 1 week after.."

Jomi said, "It is... Related."

Mijo said, "What??? How do YOU know that???"

Jomi said, "It is a test of your capabilities, intelligence and time management. The invaders will make the Dark World vanish. Never to be seen."

Mijo said, "Uhhh, what does that mean using simple words?"

Jomi said, "Basically, the exams are the invaders."

Mijo said, "Oh! I get it! So to pass the test, kailangan kong patayin ang mga dayuhan?"

Jomi said, "Yeah.."

Mijo said, "Saan ba mabubuksan ang portal sa dark world? Kung dati lang, andoon yon sa Yala-Dez room..."

Jomi said, "As far as i know, it could be anywhere, but it should be near your room."

Mijo said, "Teka lang! Are phones allowed here in the dark world?"

Jomi said, "Siguro, pero di mo magagamit ang internet."

Mijo said, "Ah, sige, pero paano ba ako makakabalik sa aming mundo? Nasaan ba yung fountain"?

Jomi said, "I can take you there. Though, i am curious, how would you explain to all of your classmates that a dark world just exists sa kanilang silid-aralan?"

Mijo said, "Either sasabihin na panaginip ang lahat nito o sabihin na wag magsumbong sa guro."

Jomi said, "Ok, ok, ok... Lets go."

So, they went below and below until they were at the floor of the tower.

Jomi said, "Don't you want to greet your friends first?"

Mijo said, "Nah, they are already busy with each other and also i just want to go home and rest for the big fight tomorrow..."

Jomi said, "I understand... Here." 

Jomi gives Mijo a book titled "Jomi's Guide to the Dark World".

Mijo said, "What am I supposed to be using this for? Alam ko na kung paano gumagana ang dark world eh..."

Jomi said, "It might not matter now, but it will matter later. Anyways, we should head here."

Mijo said, "Ok fine, i'll keep it, something to read i guess."

So they went behind the staircase and into the dark fountain.

Jomi said, "Here. You know what to do."

Mijo said, "Yeah, thanks! Also, what happens when i close this one? What happens to you?"

Jomi said, "When a dark world is opened, only a portal to it is opened, when closed, the dark and light worlds stay separate."

Mijo said, "Ok! Makes sense. Anyways imma go see ya when i see ya!"

Jomi said, "Goodbye!"

So Mijo closed the dark fountain and everything went back to normal, Mijo woke up sleeping in his seat, along with the others. At first, some were confused and then, the ones that knew it wasn't a dream turned and walked to Mijo.

Leviente first spoke, "Ah, Mijo! So paano ba natin mapapaliwanag ang lahat niyon?"

JR said, "Yeah. I DO NOT want the teachers finding out."

Rhida also said, "Ako din! Di ko alam kung paano ko masasabi sa friend group ko na lahat ng ginawa at pinag-usapan namin ay wala lang at ang pagkakatulad ng panaginip namin!! Diyos ko!"

Lauvielle added, "Yeah, yung sinabi ni Rhida at ang masasabi natin sa mga guro at sa cctv??"

Mijo finally responded, "Ok, teka lang, calm down nga muna kayo, as long as nobody tells the teachers, or even if one of us does, don't say a Qqsingle thing that can make it more believable... Just... Papunta mo nga si Jamise dito."

Rhida called Jamise and Jamise went to the group talk happening near Mijo's seat.

Mijo continued, "Can you announce WITH everybody here that the dark world indeed exists but no one should tell anybody else."

Jamise said "Ok, Mijo! Leviente, at Rhida, come on, follow me!"

Leviente and Rhida both sighed but followed Jamise's orders.

They, along with the other people who know that the dark world exists went at the front of the classroom.

Jamise announced, "8-Clam! Mayroon kaming announcement!! Rhida you go first."

Rhida said, "Ok guys, so totoo talaga na may dark world. "

Leviente said, "Yeah. Wag niyo lang sabihin sa mga guro."

Lauvielle said, "O kung hindi... Papatayin ko kayo!!!"

Mijo said, "Meron ba kayong mga tanong?"

Fexili questioned, "How? Kasi like, nasa cctv to' diba? At wala ba talagang guro na pumunta dito habang nangyayari yon?

Mijo said, "Di ko sure ehh. Pero kung merong nakakita, iisipin lang nila na panaginip yon kaya ok tayo don."

Fexili responded, "Sige, sige..."

Mijo said, "Meron pa ba? Kasi uwian na eh..."

Everyone said, "Wala na!". So they went snd started packing their bags and started to go home.

JR and Mijo were waiting in the doorway as the floor was being mopped. Leviente and Mack were waiting for the others to finish. 

Leviente said, "You know, isang taon na naglipas, at maghihiwalayan na..."

Mijo said, "Yep."

Leviente said, "Thank you for all of the memories, and hope i see you again!"

Lauvielle came up and said, "Sinasabi mo parang mamamatay si Mijo..."

Then they both left as the others were done and started to leave. Mack then closed the door after saying goodbye to the skeleton and left.

Soon JR and Mijo met up again, and said their goodbyes before returning home.

*Darkness soon will arrive....*

Mijo returned home and slept. After waking up around 12:00 AM, he reviewed and reviewed, because he had a reviewer. 

Mijo said, "Ok, so Jomi's Guide turned to MY reviewer on everything from quarter 1-4 grade 8??? But i don't do these things... It's good though so... Thanks Jomi!"

So he reviewed and reviewed. The next 3 days will be a huge battle, and he needs preparation right now.

DONE?

    <summary>CU DRAFT: The Last Supper</summary>
    <md-block>
        # CUD: The Last Supper
        Summary: After last week, our heroes want some rest and they get it, after a lot of planning and pain.

Author's Note: Wrote this at the school. I am gonna rewrite whole sections of this. So this is a draft worth keeping because i am inspired by this to make something else.

Mijo woke up and saw it was 7:00 AM. It was bad but since it was a school event today, no penalties for arriving late so he got up, ate, showered and gone to school.

Mijo arrived at the school at 7:45 AM, pretty late since the event started at 7:30 but he continued, he went to the classroom, no one was there, it makes sense, but there was no dark world... Yet. As they probably are at the gym.

So he put his bag and bananas at the table and went to the gym and sat down near JR and Yeasa. He greeted JR but he sat down and watched the gym, as singers sing, principals dance, and more principal remarks about the school year ending. Eventually the Principal got the Teachers at the front along with photographers to take a picture of the school year. The principal had the microphone and was directing the teachers but Mijo wasn't paying attention, he was just thinking to himself. But after the teachers were going back, the gym announced the teams that were gonna fight later.

"The Blu Grilies!!! Led by Pineda!"

"The White Pandas!!! Led by Crus!"

"The Yellow Scubas!!! Led by Boicno! "

"The Blak Horses!!! Led by Paroño!"

They took the oath of sportsmanship, and their league, the "DKB League 2!!!" was announced by the principal and they took a group photo. The opening was over and they all headed to their classrooms. A Mental Health Break.

Nothing important happened, they just started preparing for the presentation of the food at 10:30.

Mijo decided to open the dark world, for the first time. So he plunged his pencil to the ground and darkness spread throughout the classroom. Eventually falling to that same place once when he entered the classroom when it had a dark world. He got up and walked to the city again, this time, there were tables, chairs and a lot of food; hipon, banana and tilapia filled the tables.

JR greeted him, playing sudoku very hard. Mijo quickly went up the tower nearby and saw Jomi again.

"Hi! Uh you said that it was possible for any lightner to open dark worlds... Here we are! I opened it!" Mijo said.

"Ok... I suppose its fine for today, but you should go back, a game is playing." Jomi said.

"What do you me- Ohhh, right... But how do i get back without closing the portal?" Mijo questioned.

"Well, if you are the owner of the fountain, you can travel between the worlds without closing it. Just go into the fountain." Jomi said.

"How about my friends?" Mijo questioned again.

"You own the fountain, you control who gets in or out." Jomi said, "I know this because I have seen this before... on other lightners. Now go."

Mijo nodded and said goodbye to Jomi and went down to see Yeasa near the tower.

"Hey Mijo? Alam mo ba kung paano umalis dito? Last time kasi, sudden lang yung paglabas..." Yeasa said.

"I know! Just go through these stairs, and you see a fountain, just go straight through it. Easy lang, sundan mo lang ako." Mijo said.

"Ok??" Yeasa said before following Mijo through the stairs and near the fountain.

"Thank you!!" Yeasa said before going to the fountain and disappearing.

"I should go too, though since there's no inspection just yet... Close the fountain? Yeah... " Mijo said before closing the fountain.

Mijo woke up and saw jis classmates just chilling and still preparing as he just woke up on the floor. He can see Yeasa outside of the biolab going somewhere.

So he got up, went to Leviente.

Mijo said, "Wanna play chess?"

Leviente said, "Sure, just after this rubix cube is done." After Leviente completed the rubix cube, they played chess as other friends joined. 

After a while, they were called to bring some food to the classroom but as it turned out only one of them was needed so they all headed back with the food.

They continued playing chess until Leviente won with a Queen checkmate and Mijo was called again to get the tilapia and there they went back to the classroom with nothing. As the tilapia wasn't there until 11:00 AM. So Mijo went back and just sort of dozed off after the ESP Exam and Assignment were given back.

Then he was called again to get the tilapia and so he got that and went back to the classroom.
As other foods arrived, the table was starting to fill up with food and more food.

Eventually the teachers arrived and the class suprised them and they both waited for the judges. As they did, they took pictures, a lot of pictures. 

Then the class ate a lot of food and they chilled after that, Mijo goes to Urda, Yeasa and JR playing "Ganshun Pactim" on the tablet. They played a lot of games like "The Kat Empire" and "No Zombies". 

The teachers however cleaned the tables and called on the other students. Mijo passed his portfolio in TCI soon after. 

Then he got a chair and sat down near the table to sleep and he did for around until the championships in which JR woke him up, because the awardings would start. He slept again.

After a while, JR woke him up again due to the awardings which is starting now and they want all of them there. So he went along with his classmates, at first the line was confusing but then other sections also lined up so it was easy from there.

The awardings started. Boring. After that a lot of misdirection due to them suprising with a song break. But first, advice and inspiring speech. SONG BREAK TIME!!! 

After a while, it was time to go home, so 8-Clam went back to their classroom and Mijo was with them and after they arrived...

Mijo decided to finally open the dark world again.

At the same spot, he plunged his pencil to the ground and darkness once again rose and spread. All in the classroom fell to the darkness once more.

Mijo woke up again. This time on top of the tower, Jomi walked up to him and said, "You must get up, I have something to say." So she pulled him up and Mijo talked, "What do you want to say?"

Jomi said, "All of these adventures, don't you wanna rest, at this point? I can give you a restart."

Mijo said, "What? What do you mean?"

Jomi said, "This and your world will dissapear if you don't restart.. everything."

Mijo said, "Wha- What? Right now?!?"

Jomi said, "I noticed that everything has been collapsing, losing its grip in reality, becoming dark. Whoever created this world is losing their grip on it for reasons."

Mijo said, "Do you know? "

Suddenly the walls around the city disappeared into the dark. People below were confused and panicking.

Jomi said, "It looks like the walls are down. I might know why but you'll have to see for yourself. Now restart! Only lightners can!"

Mijo said, "Wha- ok then!"

So Mijo pressed restart and suddenly it went dark. Not dark world darkness, pure darkness. Mijo saw text being typed, narrating everything he's doing. 

I wrote, "Mijo, i am sorry for this but i must end this. For your and everyone sake."

Mijo said, "How? Will i keep memory of this?"

I answered, "No. Atleast where you're going. I will consider that though. Goodbye."

Mijo said, "Ok. I can see where this is going. Goodbye too."

*So the world was covered in darkness...*

Note: Done?

<!--Chapter after Dark world i think? Chapter 7 now. definitively.-->
<p id="C7"><md-block># C7: The Last Supper</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: Mijo and his friends, after going through a lot last week, decided to rest, eat and enjoy their school event, until someone interrupts.

Author's Notes: Rewrote an entire chapter in school. Missed out on like on the entire league games but its worth it! Also someone helped.

Also (yep...):

Chees - Chess

Sukodu - Sudoku

Mijo woke up and saw that he was almost certainly late. 

"Ah shit.. Go go go!!"

So he got out of bed and he prepeared to go to school. After eating, showering, and dressing up, he went out of his house and went to school. 

"Sana pareho lang sa dati..."

He was suprised that he wasn't checked for being late but he moved quickly to his classroom as an event was happening outside.

"Woah, really?!? Wow guess i'm wrong... Gotta keep movin' though."

So he opened the door and.. it was dark. Like dark world dark. 

"Whaat?!? Dark world already? But can't i not go out unless i close the fountain again? Well, i'm sure i wont miss anything... important anyway."

So he jumped in with his bananas to the dark world. He landed safely on like a red carpet with Jomi standing near, greeting him.

Jomi said, "Oh! Hi Mijo! You must be late! Its... almost 8! And the event is supposed to start at-"

Mijo said, "Yeah, yeah. No need to be reminding about it. Now uh.. how did they all get out of here? I dont see anyone, and i think i saw some of my friends at the gym?"

Jomi said, "Oh! Uh i have a new way of you guys going in and out of the dark world. Basically just go back there again if you want to go outside."

Mijo said, "Coool. Can you put this away for me? Thanks!!!" Before quickly dropping his bag and bananas and going back to the light world.

Jomi said, "Hey! Get back here! Damn it. I knew he would do that. Its easy to bring them anyway. I have magic." and so she just moved them to a place near the red carpet near a bunch of closets with magic.

Mijo then exited out of the dark world out to the outside of the classroom. He quickly joined the others in the gym and watched what was happening in the gym.

Principal said, "Welcome to your Last Dinner officially with your fellow students! I declare the DKB League open! Enjoy it! I want to also get Ms. Sopah to sing for us!"

Mijo said, "Yooo, meron magkakanta sa stage???"

*later..*

Mijo said again, "Yoo, sumsasayaw ang principal natin??"

JR said, "Yep."

*much later..*

Mijo said, "Yo, so these are the DKB Teams..."

JR said, "Yeah, i don't know why the teams specify the color when, halimbawa, black na nga yung raven eh..."

Both laughed.

*much much later*

Principal said, "With that, i dismiss you all to your own classrooms! Good luck to all!!!"

Mijo said, "Finally, the teacher group photo is over, so we can go back to our classroom now... "

JR said, "Mijo, lets go na!"

So they went back to the classroom, where one-by-one people jumped into the dark world. As people walked in, they all saw a huge castle with towers. JR was the first one so he got to meet Jomi for the first time.

Jomi said, "Hello! Welcome to My Castle Town... What's your name?"

JR said, "I don't know you.. How about you first??"

Jomi muttered to herself, "Damn it, i knew this hoodie wouldn't work..."

Jomi then said, "Well.." takes off her hoodie, and said, "I'm Jomi. The Princess of the Dark. You?"

JR said, "Ok? I'm JR... You look like Mijo.. Are you trying to imitate him- wait... Are you Mijo's twin?"

Jomi said, "Uhh?? No- Maybe? Look, just go inside the castle, ok? I'm like busy.."

JR said, "Sige, sige..." before walking inside the castle..

Then Mijo was next..

Jomi said, "Hi! Mijo.. this is a new castle i worked on last weekend so.. i hope you enjoy it!"

Mijo said, "Thanks! Asan pala yung bags namin?"

Jomi said, "It's.. inside. I moved it inside. You would see it."

Mijo said, "Ok, ok.. Goodbye! See you later!"

Jomi said, "Y- You too!"

Then a few more other students, then Lauvielle and Leviente appeared.

Jomi said, "He-"

Leviente cut off and said, "Yo, wait, kamukha ka ni Mijo! Weird... I thought Mijo would say if he clone himself..."

Jomi said, "Well-"

Lauvielle said, "Or, she just looks like him, ok? Everyone that looks like Mijo is not just cloning..."

Jomi said, "Yeah.. So hello, welcome to the dark world, this is my castle, i hope you enjoy it!"

Lauvielle said, "Tara na, Leviente!"

So they went to the castle. Other student followed until Urda and Jamise appeared.

Jomi said, "Hello! Welcome to the Dark World, this is my castle, i hope you enjoy it!" 

Jamise said, "So.. what's your name? Also is this your home also? Where's your CR's? Bedroom? Kitchen? Tell me more!"

Urda said, "Jamise, sa tingin ko lang, nasobrahan na siya, tignan mo naman!"

Jomi is blank staring towards Jamise.

Jamise said, "Tama ka... Pasok na tayo sa loob.."

So both of them went into the castle, next was a few more students then lastly was Rhida and Mack.

Jomi said to herself, "Oh, finally.. the last ones."

Then she said, "Hi! Welcome to the Dark World! My Castle Town! You people are the last ones! So what are your names?"

Rhida said, "Well, my name is Rhida, he is Mack.. B'at gusto mo?"

Mack whispered to Rhida, "Sis, di siguro siya nagtatagalog??"

Rhida whispered back, "Ay, oo nga.."

Jomi said, "Well, i always track the first and last ones that enter my castle, it's for... remembrance. Anyways you guys can enter my castle now?"

Mack whispered again, "Teka lang, naiintindihan niya ang tagalog..."

Mack said to Jomi, "Nagsasalita ka ba ng Tagalog?"

Jomi said, "Uhh, opo?"

Rhida said, "Pwede mo ba sabihin na "Papatayin ko kayo!"? It's a word for "I like you all".

Jomi said, "Gusto ko kayong lahat?"

Rhida whispered to Mack, "Ay, alam niya 'to.. Pumasok nalang tayo sa castle?"

Mack agreed, "Ok!!"

Then they quickly rushed inside the castle.

Jomi said, "Well. I guess i should go in myself..." 

So she went in, and left the door out for anyone else.

From the doors you can see a huge staircase and multiple rooms beside the stairs. Behind the stairs was a huge room, like a gymnasium of a school. you can see a huge cluster of tables in the middle and chairs beside the walls. The chairs that look like the plastic chairs you would see in the light world. On the tables there were banana leaves as plates and food on top of it, fruits like bananas and papayas, eggs, fish like tilapia, and more.

Everybody was just talking about random stuff, then Mijo went to Jomi, just after entering the room.

Mijo asked, "Hey, so you have somewhat good advice.. How do you get the **teachers** and the **judges** to... not see the dark world? I mean the whole room's a dark world..." 

Jomi said, "Well, you could seal the fountain? I don't know who opens it but when it does, you guys go to where the red carpet begins."

Mijo said, "How about you? Also how will we go back here if the teachers stay for like a long time?"

Jomi said, "You can come back anytime, Mijo. and everybody else here too. Just, make a fountain?"

Mijo said, "And how do i do that? I only discovered the dark worlds, i didn't make them!"

Jomi said, "Well, i know a way of opening them..."

Mijo said, "What? Tell me!"

Jomi said, "Can i say it the prophecy way or the simple way?"

Mijo said, "Uhhhh, Prophecy way, 'cause that's more interesting and I can always just get the simple explanation right?

Jomi said, "Yes..."

Jomi readied herself and explained the prophecy...

Jomi said, "A long time ago, a _lightner_ was very bored and dissatisfied with their world and so went on a worldwide journey to find the perfect place to live. There, she met a _witch_, a witch that told tales of a **dark world** that was fun and adventurous but required someone determined enough and in possession of a _sharp_ object. She was that person, so she made one right outside the witch's hut which opened the veil between worlds, this amount of darkness outside, would cause **CHAOS**. So eventually, _three heroes_, a **king**, a **queen** and a **princess of the dark** locked her inside the darkness for which she stays until she comes back."

Mijo said, "So... In summary, sharp objects make a dark world and the three heroes stop the bad guy.."

Jomi said, 'I wouldn't say it like that but yes."

Mijo said, "Ok, so if someone opens the dark world, thats bad?"

Jomi said, "Yes? Well this one isn't exactly bad but if too many open or if the fountain expands way too much, the balance will break." 

Mijo said, "I see..." then he turned to the class.

Mijo announced, "Well, everybody! Go back the way you came.. We will return later. The teachers and judges are gonna come and leave here eventually..."

Fexili questioned, "Teka lang, ayaw niyo ba ipakita ang dark world na ito sa mga guro at judges?"

Jamise said, "Well, kasi nga, nasa kompetisyon tayo, so pag nakita nila ito, either hindi sila maniniwala na totoo ang lahat na nandito o i-disqualify tayo kasi, as far as we know, walang dark world yung iba."

Rhida said, "Tama ka dyan, Jamise, pero paano ang dark world? Mawawala lahat nito kung papasukin natin sila!"

Mijo said, "Not exactly, but pwede natin buksan ito mamaya. Trust me!'

So, everybody went back to the fountain in which they went out one by one until Mijo was the last one.

Mijo said, "Uh, are you sure you'll be fine?'

Jomi said, "Yes."

Mijo said, "Ok... Ok..." 

Then Mijo realized something, "Wait, how would for example if I move my bags in the light world, does it move in the dark world?"

Jomi said, "Hm, I don't know... Whatever happens, i will be fine."

Mijo said, "Ok. I'll go... I'mma test it out!"

So Mijo closed the fountain and the biology lab was back to its old form. Mijo was on the floor, laying there. The others were either trying to cover up the lab or were waiting for the darkness to go away.

Mijo said, "Well, what now..."

Jamise opened the door to find Mijo laying down on the floor.

Jamise said, "Hey! Mijo, what are ya' doing on the floor? And why are you just laying there??"

Mijo responded, "No, i was sitting here because there's no CHAIRS..."

Rhida was behind Jamise...

Rhida said, "Hindiii kaya, nakita namin kita na nakahiga lamang sa sahig..."

Mijo said, "Fine... you're right but uh lets organize this whole thing..." 

Rhida said, "Yeah! Ok so-"

The door opened again and JR appeared and said, "Pwede na po ba pumasok?"

Jamise said, "Oo, pasok na kayo!"

Then all of the other students went in and one by one went to their respective groups and the door was closed.

As the Rhida, JR, Jamise and others were preparing for the "Boodle Fight" competition, Mijo went to Leviente.

Mijo said, "Yo wanna play some chees?"

Leviente said, "Sure!" 

So he played chess with Leviente winning both as Black and White and Mijo won once as White.

As the class was doing random things such as JR playing Sukodu, Domez and Vink were playing with rubiks cubes, and the rest were either finishing up their last schoolwork or chilling.

Then suddenly Jamise announced, "8-Clam! Papunta na dito ang mga Teachers! Mag-ready na kayo!"

So 8-Clam readied themselves such as watching out for the teachers for the others, preparing poses and songs, readying to record and other fun stuff. They waited patiently, until...

Banya shouted, "They're here!!!!" and quickly went to the classroom.

As soon as the teachers opened the door, most of the class struck a pose and sang happy birthday for whatever reason. Not long after, the judges arrived.

Judge 1 said, "Ooohh, i like this one, yung parang sushi!"

Judge 2 said, "The design looks nice... 8-C-L-A-M, 8-Clam!"

Judge 3 said, "Hmmm, the bananas taste weird..."

The judges rate it 7/10. 8-Clam got last place...  So after that the class ate their last supper with the teachers. After cleaning up, and the teachers going out of the classroom, Mijo decided it was time. 

Mijo murmured to himself, "Hmmm, a pencil is sharp enough i think?"

So Mijo stabbed the pencil into the ground with full force, and dark smoke filled the room.

Fexili shouted, "Hey! Who turned off the ligh- oh..."

Yeasa said, "Why is it suddenly dark?"

Urda said weakly, "Oh, well ok then...."

They all fell to the dark abyss below and transformed into their respective dark world forms, it felt weird like a tingling feeling accompanying the clothes as they took over.

Mijo said, "Woah, it's nice to be back here!"

Jomi then appeared in front of the staircase, then looked at Mijo and said,
