    # C1d DeltaRambles: Reunion de Avance

Deltarune-inspired story: ()

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees his best friend Urda. She was waiting on him, because there was a good project they had to do, so they went, and not so long class was over. But after a while of cleaning, they went home but before going, 

Mijo said "Yo, so i heard of this rumor that like near the you-know emerald room, there was like a whole dark world-" 

Urda said "You really think that deltarune exists for real!" 

Mijo said "Unlikely, but hey the probability's there." 

Urda said "Really, how do you even access it? The room's dark or its-"

Mijo cut off "Alright maybe its not really there, BUT! I mean its open, i think?"

Urda said "Really, huh?" "Well if you keep talking about it, seriously dude."

So after closing up the class, they went to the place and tested the doors.. They were open! They entered but it was dark... Too dark. 

Mijo said "Ok, but like lets check if the lights work"

Urda said "So what, you can fall and- Oh, he's gone."

Urda then thought about what would happen if she was asked where Mijo could have gone or more boring days of school, and so she went in, but as soon as she went in she fell and the door closed.

*dark world shenanigans*

Draft Notes: Full of Grammar mistakes and general confusing execution but this is from the original one wrote so from this point i rewrite again.

# C1 DeltaRambles: Reunión de Avancé

Summary: A secret hidden in the very top... Mijo and Urda discover new worlds and people?!?! 

Author Note: Deltarune-inspired story but also taglish all around, also I am kinda not proud of this but the premise is good... I will just write the other parts, see where this goes. BTW the title is from miting de avance which is the filipino version of advanced meeting from my HCPSMSHS Election Days.

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical Honrato student is. Anyway he sees Urda, a random classmate. She was waiting on him, because there was a project they had to do, so they went to the classroom, but they got an opportunity to go home when the teacher announced:

Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayong 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-" 

Mijo said and everyone said "WOOO UWIAN NA!!!"

So, it was time to go home but Mijo's and Urda's service wasn't here yet and after going to the waiting shed- Suddenly, darkness explodes and it looks like it's near the Fajado Building, near their classroom.

Mijo said "It's probably dangerous, but YOLO i guess..." 

Urda quickly cut in and said "Hoy! Mijo diba?"

Mijo surprised, said "Uh, yeah, Hey you wanna go to our classroom?"

Urda shocked, said "Bro, really?" paused and said Hindi ako pupunta malapit don PERO I am warning you!"

Mijo said "Good point, but-"

But then the darkness expanded and soon the floor was no longer safe. Mijo, sensing something was about to happen, quickly rushed to Urda.

Mijo said "I'm afraid, this might be our last day..."

Urda said "Well, kung ito ay ang parang alam ko, magiging okey tayo."

Mijo said "Huh? What does that mean?"

Suddenly the ground shook with fear and they fell to the darkness...

Mijo woke up in the eternal darkness with only a platform. Surprisingly, the fall wasn't that bad. But he decided to stand up and look around. Oceans of darkness are all around and only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and after seeing weird black goop, he saw a bunch of cabinets and tables, perfect for hiding, and so he went there and as he was walking very loudly, he heard *someone*... So he readied up his sword (wait he had one?) and stay cautioned, ready for whoever was making that sound and suddenly Urda showed herself with a sword and flintlock pistol. 

"HEY! Who are you! Wait-" said Urda, surprised.

"OH, ay nako it's just you..." said Mijo, also surprised.

"DAMN... Malapit na kitang barilin! Dapat meron kang sinabi..." said Urda apologetically.

"Yeah, woops sorry!! Well what do we do now???" said Mijo, as he put his sword away.

"Huh, waait a minute... Meron ka lang espada... Ako merong espada AT baril!" said Urda, mockingly.

"Well, that doesnt matter, i can deflect your bullets with my sh-" but there wasn't a shield in his inventory... "-sword! Yeah.. my sword.." said Mijo embarrassed.

"Haha! But ok punta kaya tayo, uh doon?" said Urda, pointing towards the only path not going backwards. 

"Aight, let's go!" said Mijo.

They went together towards the darkness and after walking a lot, they saw a school that had like a gate and guardhouse like Honrato! 

"Yo! We found something! Its honrato?" Mijo said, very confused.

"Whaat? Uh nakikita mo ba na may tao?" Urda said, also confused.

"No... Can we go in?" said Mijo confirming.

"Kung hindi, meron tayong.... isa pang opsyon."
said Urda, pointing to her gun. 

"Sure. But like we DON'T have to... I'll join you though if it ever comes to that however.. " said Mijo, thinking about it.

"Fiiine... Sisiguraduhin mabait ako... Sa kanila..." Urda said, whining.

So they went in, and the gate opened for them.

"Ok???" Mijo said, being confused at the whole situation. Urda kept quiet, silently observing everything.

They turned towards the gym and saw everyone! 

"Uh..." Mijo said, then saw a person and said "Hi! Do you know- wait he is just.. ignoring me!" Hey!" Mijo said, getting more anxious decided to ignore it and move towards the gym but then time quicky flew by from 3:00 PM to 5:05 PM.
As fast as they walked in, it was suddenly time to leave.

Urda spoke up. "Ayah, ano ang nangyayari dito? Puro nakakabaliw na nakikita natin, siguro meron nangyari satin ah, Mijo?"

Mijo rebutted, "Well, right ka, nahulog tayo papunta sa dilim, but kasi kung namatay tayo, dapat ba kaya merong tayong makikitang demonyo dito?"

Urda answered, "Luh, baga ito ang personal na hell sa atin-"

Mijo interrupted, "O pwede itong yung... Alam mo yung runedelta?"

Urda said, "Yeah, you uh keep talking to me about it, so i watched some of it."

Mijo said, "Oops, well, hopefully useful naman ang na-aral ko don... Wait.. kung galing sa Fajado, then magsearch tayo don..."

In response Urda said, "OK!"

But she continued to wonder if she was the one controlling time as, she was looking at the clock and it was moving wherever she thinks, 5,4,3 PM, anything really but it was kinda liberating, but she needed to find out how it works...

Though, as she thought that, Mijo found the source. The Biolab. But as soon as they opened the door... It wasnt the same biolab they left when they were... Alive? But, with nothing left to explore or find, they went in..

*Game has been started*

Immediately skeletons raise from the ground... They didnt look friendly. Both of them drew their swords and started fighting.. First, Mijo slashed through the skeletons, but found out that swords are really hard to wield, he eventually fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Urda with her insane reaction time managed to dodge and shoot all skeletons and stabbed one directly in their rib cage but due to inexperience she also fell to the ground.

Mijo who was very exhausted and tired said, "These skeletons... AHHHH why can't i fight them like i practiced to? I always stab myself more than them!"

Urda who was the same also said, "Yeah! Me too man... My aim is pretty garbage and the sword too.."

The skeletons approached, holding their swords... They had to think of something.

Mijo said, "From what i know, we usually don't have powers but since this is WAY different SO we should be able to do SOMETHING!"

Urda said, "I agree! Hmm..." 

Urda tried to harness whatever power she had, but she got hit in the stomach before she could do anything.

Mijo said, "Ah shit! Right, these stupid skeletons, OK I deal with them you get whatever you have... If it doesn't work uhhh I don't know?"

Urda got up and said, "Ok then.. Thanks for the sacrifice!"

Mijo scoffed but continued trying to defend against the skeletons which were many but he was able to kill a couple before he got pushed back.

Mijo said, "Are you heckin' ready or something???"

Urda said, "No... Of course not!"

Both of them looked desperate and sad. As the skeletons approached and slashed one last time against them suddenly, they felt power resonate in them... As soon as they felt it, first Mijo immediately began to rip through skeletons, bone by bone and second, Urda was able to stop time and throw a sword into a skeleton before shooting a bunch of skeletons multiple times before resuming time.

Mijo screamed, "DIE! DIE! YOU BONE HEADED CREATURES!!!" As he was slicing like a lightning bolt.

Urda said more calmly, "OK.... Fuck all of you skeletons!" before shooting and stopping time a lot.

The skeletons were outmatched in magic and so they all died, piece by piece. Eventually the battlefield cleared and both were left with bones and more bones.

Mijo and Urda were breathing very heavily and were super duper tired...

Mijo said, "Hahaha... We won! Against skeletons... Honestly.. kinda thought we would just die.."

Urda responded, 'Yeah, didn't know we had powers!"

<!--CHAPTER 2 Definido-->
# C2 DeltaRambles: School Chess Game

Summary: Chess Game in school and shenanigans happen. Friends missing and searches...

Author Notes: A friend helped me with this and uh yeah just wanted to play chess and decided this is a great chance to write something. So i hope you enjoy it! BTW might not be inline with the canon this was based on as i write this i havent finished the last one but yeah!

Mijo steps into the school, and begins walking to class and after opening the door and taking a seat:

JR said, "Hello Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Hi! Uh so what you doin' "

JR said, "Reviewing for AP quiz later... Have you reviewed?"

Mijo said, "No... I am right now!"

JR said, "Ok..."

Then JR talked to someone else and Mijo decided to sit and review until Urda showed up and got Mijo's attention.

Urda spoke up, "Hey... Mijo, So meron akong sasabihin sayo na dapat tayo lang may alam..."

Mijo said, "Ok... Hmmm what's it?"

Urda said, "So, meron ka bang nakaranas na dark world?"

Mijo said, "Uhh, yes???? You did too? I thought panaginip lang 'yon!"

Urda said, "Yun din isip ko, pero it was too na real at di ko pa nakakalimutan eh..."

Mijo said, "Well, ano na gagawin natin?"

Urda said, "Well, kung magkapareho ang pagbukas sa deltarune sa dito.. Pwede natin gawin ngayon?"

Mijo said, "Hmm, gusto mo?"

Urda said, "Oo naman, na-obsess nako don, meron nga kong drawing at iba pa, diba ikaw din?"

Mijo said, "Oo, ako din-"

Then, Jamise interrupted: "Hey! So ayaw ko interrupt yung bonding time niyo, pero pinapapunta na tayo sa gym"

Mijo and Urda both stared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After following Jamise, and heading outside of the class, into the gym but then suddenly darkness spews out of the door near the chemist lab that was near the pathway to the gym and at first all of them were surprised but then Urda and Mijo quickly ran towards it and jumped into the chemistry lab and as Jamise was chasing them: "Hey! Stop!!!".

But as Jamise stared into the abyss, she decided to jump in as her friends were there and the flag raising ceremony was gonna be boring anyway and so she decided to jump and fall.

*darker, yet darker*

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

Mijo and Urda both fell at the same time but as soon as they landed, they saw that they were in some kind of black and white board and looked around to see: Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn! It was chess!!! But instead it was too big and so they had to make a choice: white or black?

Mijo spoke up, "Yo uhh what color should we choose?"

Urda said, "Uhhhhh, Di ako naglalaro ng chess?"

Mijo said, "White it is then!"

So they took the white pieces and started the game. They vaguely saw a person with black jacket, long hair and a staff playing the black pieces.

Urda said, "So, since di ako naglalaro ng chess, dito lang ako, manonood."

Mijo said, "Ok then, watch and learn!"

*Meanwhile, in the light world...*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*Back to the Dark World!*

So the game started, white moves pawn to e4, black moves to e5, knight moves to f3, knight moves to c6, bishop to c4, knight to g5, pawn to h6, queen to h5, queen takes knight g5, queen takes pawn f7, king moves to d8 and queen takes bishop g8, checkmate!

"Thats... Checkmate! Why was that so easy, i mean... Who else trolls like that?", said Mijo.

"Probably Jamise, but i can't prove it!", said Urda.

"What? But-" said Mijo before getting cut off by that person playing black suddenly running towards them.

Mijo and Urda both readied up their defensive stances and watched as the figure eventually was visible enough to be... Wait.. isn't that Jamise?

Mijo and Urda calmed down, and talked to Jamise.

Jamise first spoke, "Hey? What was that for?"

Mijo responded, "Bruhhh, we thought you were an enemy! Of course we had our weapons out... But for the chess game uhhh-"

Jamise cut off Mijo, "I understand! But.. Ano ang lugar na'to? Why are we dressed up like fantasy magical people?"

Urda spoke up, "Basically, Jamise, parang alternate world na may cool monsters, powers at mga lugar na pwede i-explore!"

Mijo then responded, "Yeah, what she said.. We should head out... Malalate tayo!"

So they went out of the chess room and into the unknown...

*At the Light World...*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

*Lauvielle joined the conversation!*

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As the lighteners were going around in the dark, looking at the endless piles of scientist gear...

Jamise spoke up, "Soo like pano ba maglaban? You guys seem prepared?"

Urda first said, "Basically, Jamise, parang meron magpapakitang mga kalaban... At pag nagkaroon ng musika, pwede mo na sila patayin! At umm??"

Jamise spoke again, "Mhmm.. at??? Ano!?!!"

Urda said again, "Magkakaroon ka ng mga powers.. diko alam kung paano, di din alam ni Mijo eh.."

Jamise said, "Ah! Kaya pala staff lang ang meron sakin haha... Paano gamitin?"

Urda thought as she spoke, "Uhhhhhh????"

Mijo said, "I think it's believing in yourself? At least that's what the sign said last time..."

Urda said, "O-Oh yeah!! Yuon!! Nakalimutan ko...
"

*Light shines through!*

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason.

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"

JR and Rhida nod in agreement.

Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."

As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

JR said, "Ok... Perfecto!" and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.

Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"

But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.

Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."

Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

*Back into the Darkness.*

Jamise said, "But Urda! I don't believe in myself! I need to know EXACTLY how!!"

Urda said, "Well, nakuha ko yon noong mapapatay ako ng mga skeletons doon, so... Pwede kaya yon?

Jamise said, "THANK YOU!!!"

Then they heard someone fall and hit the ground...

Mijo said, "Sino yon?? Let's draw our weapons..."

Jamise said, "Bakit pala lagi kayo nakaready? Di naman siguro laging may nagtinig meron kalaban?"

Urda said, "Necessary kasi... Last time di kami ganito, na-ambush kami..."

Jamise said, "Oh! ok..."

## C2p2 DeltaRambles: At the School: Chess Game
Author Notes: A friend helped me with this one

Summary: 

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

*1 hour later*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*1 more hour later*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

Lauvielle joined the conversation!

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason. 

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

They went back to their classroom and soon enough, rumors started spreading that the chemistry lab was so dark, that not even light from outside could illuminate it and it even spread darkness but only then only a select small people specifically from 8-Clam confidently know but it got around to the teacher, she checked the cctv and found nothing, like literally just black from the hallway and the chemistry lab. Weird, guess the cctv is broken..

Lunch came and they decided to sneakily take Urda, Mijo and Jamise's bags to the Chemistry Lab where they threw it hopeful that they are there along with JR but they weren't sure and even if, it was the only spot that could hide something so they threw it there and left it until later.

Mam Arcea said, "Asan si Cara, Aman at si Rira?"

Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"

Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... So-" and after that class continued...

<!--Chapter 4 Draft-->
# C4 DeltaRambles: Back to Reality

Summary: School is a burden on these hopeful lightners to save the world... It would take an exam to stop them right in their tracks...

Author's Note: Basically all of my anxiety, frustration and stress from my school exams into this story.

After another dark world has been sealed in the computer lab, they decided to leave. As chances of anyone seeing them there were high and they didn't want to get sent to the principal or guidance office. So Mijo, Urda, and JR exited out to find Rhida, Leviente and Lauvielle talking at the tables near the computer lab.

Rhida said, "There's an exam!? But, we literally have the worlds to explore!"

Leviente said, "Exams... The NAT, E. Math and English, ICT, Math, AP, and others.. Also periodical exam next week."

Lauvielle said, "Yeah, lahat ngayon ay nakakabaliw sa isang tao!"

Rhida saw the other group and said, "O-Oh! Hello Balts!!!"

JR responded, "Hi Rhida! So-"

Leviente quickly said, "Yo, we should head back... 12:50 PM na!"

So they all rushed towards the classroom and opened the door to find their bags and the lights out. As they head for their bags and pack up,

Mijo said, "Uh, I can't believe we didn't contribute towards cleaning this classroom! Though the Garbage is still here.." as he sees two ziplocks filled with garbage.

JR said, "We'll just have to take it then, you Mijo, take one as well."

Mijo said, "Ok, ok..."

But as Rhida was about to leave, Mijo quickly approached her and convinced her to stay for one last announcement.

Mijo announced, "Uh, Urda!, JR, Leviente, Lauvielle and Rhida. Anyone here agrees to keep the dark worlds a secret- raise your hands if you agree."

All of them raised their hands. 

Mijo then said, "Good to know. Alright y'all can leave no-"

As he says that, Rhida and Urda rush out of the door being super late to their schedule. Eventually, Leviente and Lauvielle also leave and after that it's just JR and Mijo.

Mijo said, "Hopefully, nothing bad happens tomorrow and on friday, I don't really wanna deal with exams and saving the world..."

JR laughed and said, "Yeah..."

They left and closed the classroom as they left the school to go to their home, though their parents were not that happy. They understood that both of their lies that "Cleaning is hard you know?".

The next day rolls in, not much interesting happened as quizzes and pts were being done. But Mijo at lunch decided to look around for the next dark world but couldn't, thankful for this, he went back and studied and chatted along with the other students.

But something was brewing... *Darkness* will soon appear once again..

As ESP started, Mijo was just chillin' but as the NAT quickly arrived, his friends including but not limited to Urda, Leviente and Rhida went to the Computer Laboratory to begin their test.

Things were "fine" for the rest of the class as they waited patiently by reviewing many many notes but then Mijo began to think about the dark world again... He thought to himself that he should do this later, at home and night. Due to the exam LATER for him so he continued to review, hopefully distracting from the whole dark world stuff.

ICT came and he did the portfolio, it was tedious and boring but hey he did procrastinate last night to do the title soo yeah! (It was a cool drawing). After that, Mijo checked the clock and it was 2:33 PM. Near when they were going to the computer lab. It was time to study again and so he did. 

*Darkness spreads*

It was time to go. He and the others went to the comp lab and were told to sit at the nearby chairs and tables and they were 'reviewing' but not really as they weren't allowed to bring notes or phones so they just sat there and talked about random stuff until the roll call started..

Sir Joriec announced, "Ok, its time to roll call everyone here soo..." As he looks for the first name, "Caboc! Stand here.... Cala! Stand next to him!" 

Mijo had Cala as his last name so he went behind Caboc and the roll call continued until all were in a line and weren't blocking the pathway. 

Sir Joriec asked, "Hmmm, where is Rich, Delo Cuz, and.."

Sir Calas said, "Oh! They just arrived!" Pointing behind Sir Joriec. 

Sir Joriec said, "Ok... Rich! Stand there!" And the roll call continued

They waited as the first batch was finishing and getting out of the computer lab and getting their things. Urda was the first one and got out as soon as possible but then, Rhida, Mack, Leviente and JR burst out of the door and were talking though Mijo could barely hear them.

Rhida said, "How did you guys do??"

Mack said, "Very bad po!! Papunta na po ako sa Summer Class!"

All of them laughed.

Leviente said, "Ganon lang talaga pre-"

Rhida said, "Hey! Papasa ka kaya..."

Leviente said, "Ikaw din!"

JR was silent and was the first one to go to the classroom along with the others. 

Back to Mijo, he was slowly panicking and after they were allowed to go in, he sat down and started to log in. Some people were having problems for some reason but after 2 got kicked because they had no account, the test was started with a questionnaire.

*The day nears its end*

The questionnaire was kinda easy, honesty is the best policy they said, so he just answered mostly truthfully including the part where he would go to summer class which he answered no to.

*A test of knowledge and power*

After that, there was the English quiz which was kinda easy, but then Science's kinda hard and Math was especially very hard for Mijo but as there was dead air in-between he started thinking about the dark worlds but he decided to stay focused. 

*Soon, it will all end...*

After the quiz was over, he left seeing Vink and JR doing something in the computer lab. But he ignored it and instead quickly went to the classroom to grab his things. There he saw Leviente, Lauvielle, and Macu cleaning up.

Leviente said, "Lets go! Bilisan mo!"

Lauvielle said, "Wait lang kasi Leviente!!"

Leviente then saw Mijo and said, "Nakikita mo ba 'to Mijo?"

Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah, also ano nangyari noong wala ako?"

Leviente said, "Uhh tignan natin, Wala kaming ginawa noong English... Nagquiz yung iba sa Math... Nag-chikahan lang kami tungkol sa Farewell Party... At si Urda lang ang naglinis noong time na!"

Then JR arrived and complained, "Bilisan niyo!!! Nagagalit na ang papa ko!"

Then CJ came in and started annoying Lauvielle.

CJ said, "B'at nandito ka Lola?"

Lauvielle responded, "Kasi CLEANERS ako!!!"

Though, they quickly cleaned up and started to leave. Almost locking Lauvielle but she left and so the door was closed yet again... By JR and all of them left.

After that, Mijo came home and slept like a sloth, and was up late doing tasks and thinking about the dark world...

Mijo said, "Today will be another day..."

DONE WOOOOOO

<!--Chapter 4 Part 2-->
## C4p2 DeltaRambles: School Reality

Summary: Another Boring Day.... Friends say goodbye though...

Author Note's: Continued my addiction to this story. Hope i finish it! 

As the Panicked Mijo quickly goes out of his house and into the tricycle, he wonders if he had any missing... 

Mijo said "Oh! Math! The Brochure... I AM SCREWED if mam Maris arrives orr mam CK arrives early... Ok as soon as i arrive i will do it.."

So Mijo rushed to school, almost late again, rushed to the classroom, sat down and begins the rushed project. He sees his friend JR doing something with Fexili on the computer, Leviente and Lauvielle reviewing with each other, Urda writing some notes... 

Mijo muttered to himself, "Ok then, let's do this!"

So he rushed it, lucky for him, Mam Maris didn't come and he finished the basic outline and started designing, he got some impressions from JR but he kept going until Mam CK arrived...

Clameans greeted the teacher, "Good Morning! Mam CK!"

So after she arrived, Mijo quickly rushed the last logo and passed it before the review and the quiz. 

*1 hour later...*

After a science quiz that was noticeably easy, Mijo stood up, walked around with JR and went to Urda who was busy with the Science Quiz.

Mijo said, "Hah.. You checked your paper, yet di ka pa tapos!"

Then as he was about to leave, he was approached by Urda.

Urda said, "Hey! Ikaw nga magpasa nito.." pointing to her quiz paper.

Mijo said, "Ikaw kaya!"

Urda said, "No, ikaw! I'll.. just follow you!"

Mijo said, "Ok, ok! Fine, let's go!"

So they rushed towards the door but before that,

Mijo asked JR, "Papunta ba si Mam Dansie sa Faculty?"

JR replied, "Yeah."

So they got out of the classroom, ran out towards the faculty room, opened the door and asked,

Mijo asked, "Asan po ba si Mam Dansie?"

A random teacher replied, "Nagkaklase po!"

So Mijo closed the faculty door and saw Mam Dansie going towards them. So they ran towards her and Urda very awkwardly gave Mam Dansie the quiz before heading back to the classroom.

Mijo, after interacting with his friends, JR, Leviente and Lauvielle, sat down in his chair and did his portfolio as JR moved seats on his own.

At lunch Mijo thought "After that, lunch! But it was a depressing lunch, I had to review a lot of quizzes and no friends to talk to.. yeah and the worst part? I also had to check my Computer Performance Task for issues which means wasting more time... Pretty uneventful for a world like this..." 

People were distracting themselves, actually reviewing, doing some performance tasks and others.. A day so boring you wonder how nothing interesting happens..

*A connection weakening...*

ICT quiz came along and there was a specific direction that screwed people's heads.. It said to write their crush and favorite teacher as Negative or Positive respectively. People all collectively lost their marbles and started making fun of it.. Some people were joking about putting their friends or were begging the teacher to let them put the initials, last and first name, Mijo put their own FULL name and the teacher's FULL name as well. It was fun..

As the English Teacher didn't arrive and people were just chillin' Mijo decided to walk and chill near the human model and researched about the dark world, how it forms based on games and how they formed earlier.

JR approached Mijo and randomly told him his parent's backstory, manners and other random facts.. The rest, Leviente was playing "AirRobin" a air defense using bow and arrow and Lauvielle was watching him, Urda was playing games with Yeasa, a game called "OTile Extreme" in which you press in sync with the music, Rhida was scrolling through Lemit, and the others were also just chillin'

Then when it was time to go home, everybody in the clasroom said their goodbyes to eachother and left, as next week will be a busy and stressful week as a lot of tasks were due and exams were present and the next next week will be pretty much a farewell party so it was a moment for all of them including Mijo.

*An interesting goodbye, i say...*

Mijo returned home and rest, for it was work tomorrow, and Sunday.

Mijo said, "This is gonna be A stressful week and I WILL be suffering but hey, it's gonna be worth it in the end..." Then he fell asleep...

DONE YOOOOOO
