    # C1d DeltaRambles: Reunion de Avance

Deltarune-inspired story: ()

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical HCPSMSHS student is. Anyway he sees his best friend Urda. She was waiting on him, because there was a good project they had to do, so they went, and not so long class was over. But after a while of cleaning, they went home but before going, 

Mijo said "Yo, so i heard of this rumor that like near the you-know emerald room, there was like a whole dark world-" 

Urda said "You really think that deltarune exists for real!" 

Mijo said "Unlikely, but hey the probability's there." 

Urda said "Really, how do you even access it? The room's dark or its-"

Mijo cut off "Alright maybe its not really there, BUT! I mean its open, i think?"

Urda said "Really, huh?" "Well if you keep talking about it, seriously dude."

So after closing up the class, they went to the place and tested the doors.. They were open! They entered but it was dark... Too dark. 

Mijo said "Ok, but like lets check if the lights work"

Urda said "So what, you can fall and- Oh, he's gone."

Urda then thought about what would happen if she was asked where Mijo could have gone or more boring days of school, and so she went in, but as soon as she went in she fell and the door closed.

*dark world shenanigans*

Draft Notes: Full of Grammar mistakes and general confusing execution but this is from the original one wrote so from this point i rewrite again.

# C1 DeltaRambles: Reunión de Avancé

Summary: A secret hidden in the very top... Mijo and Urda discover new worlds and people?!?! 

Author Note: Deltarune-inspired story but also taglish all around, also I am kinda not proud of this but the premise is good... I will just write the other parts, see where this goes. BTW the title is from miting de avance which is the filipino version of advanced meeting from my HCPSMSHS Election Days.

Mijo goes to school, and is very sleep-derived. As a typical Honrato student is. Anyway he sees Urda, a random classmate. She was waiting on him, because there was a project they had to do, so they went to the classroom, but they got an opportunity to go home when the teacher announced:

Maris, the teacher said "Nga pala, ngayong 12:00 PM uwian na niyo-" 

Mijo said and everyone said "WOOO UWIAN NA!!!"

So, it was time to go home but Mijo's and Urda's service wasn't here yet and after going to the waiting shed- Suddenly, darkness explodes and it looks like it's near the Fajado Building, near their classroom.

Mijo said "It's probably dangerous, but YOLO i guess..." 

Urda quickly cut in and said "Hoy! Mijo diba?"

Mijo surprised, said "Uh, yeah, Hey you wanna go to our classroom?"

Urda shocked, said "Bro, really?" paused and said Hindi ako pupunta malapit don PERO I am warning you!"

Mijo said "Good point, but-"

But then the darkness expanded and soon the floor was no longer safe. Mijo, sensing something was about to happen, quickly rushed to Urda.

Mijo said "I'm afraid, this might be our last day..."

Urda said "Well, kung ito ay ang parang alam ko, magiging okey tayo."

Mijo said "Huh? What does that mean?"

Suddenly the ground shook with fear and they fell to the darkness...

Mijo woke up in the eternal darkness with only a platform. Surprisingly, the fall wasn't that bad. But he decided to stand up and look around. Oceans of darkness are all around and only one path that leads somewhere. So he went into that direction and after seeing weird black goop, he saw a bunch of cabinets and tables, perfect for hiding, and so he went there and as he was walking very loudly, he heard *someone*... So he readied up his sword (wait he had one?) and stay cautioned, ready for whoever was making that sound and suddenly Urda showed herself with a sword and flintlock pistol. 

"HEY! Who are you! Wait-" said Urda, surprised.

"OH, ay nako it's just you..." said Mijo, also surprised.

"DAMN... Malapit na kitang barilin! Dapat meron kang sinabi..." said Urda apologetically.

"Yeah, woops sorry!! Well what do we do now???" said Mijo, as he put his sword away.

"Huh, waait a minute... Meron ka lang espada... Ako merong espada AT baril!" said Urda, mockingly.

"Well, that doesnt matter, i can deflect your bullets with my sh-" but there wasn't a shield in his inventory... "-sword! Yeah.. my sword.." said Mijo embarrassed.

"Haha! But ok punta kaya tayo, uh doon?" said Urda, pointing towards the only path not going backwards. 

"Aight, let's go!" said Mijo.

They went together towards the darkness and after walking a lot, they saw a school that had like a gate and guardhouse like Honrato! 

"Yo! We found something! Its honrato?" Mijo said, very confused.

"Whaat? Uh nakikita mo ba na may tao?" Urda said, also confused.

"No... Can we go in?" said Mijo confirming.

"Kung hindi, meron tayong.... isa pang opsyon."
said Urda, pointing to her gun. 

"Sure. But like we DON'T have to... I'll join you though if it ever comes to that however.. " said Mijo, thinking about it.

"Fiiine... Sisiguraduhin mabait ako... Sa kanila..." Urda said, whining.

So they went in, and the gate opened for them.

"Ok???" Mijo said, being confused at the whole situation. Urda kept quiet, silently observing everything.

They turned towards the gym and saw everyone! 

"Uh..." Mijo said, then saw a person and said "Hi! Do you know- wait he is just.. ignoring me!" Hey!" Mijo said, getting more anxious decided to ignore it and move towards the gym but then time quicky flew by from 3:00 PM to 5:05 PM.
As fast as they walked in, it was suddenly time to leave.

Urda spoke up. "Ayah, ano ang nangyayari dito? Puro nakakabaliw na nakikita natin, siguro meron nangyari satin ah, Mijo?"

Mijo rebutted, "Well, right ka, nahulog tayo papunta sa dilim, but kasi kung namatay tayo, dapat ba kaya merong tayong makikitang demonyo dito?"

Urda answered, "Luh, baga ito ang personal na hell sa atin-"

Mijo interrupted, "O pwede itong yung... Alam mo yung runedelta?"

Urda said, "Yeah, you uh keep talking to me about it, so i watched some of it."

Mijo said, "Oops, well, hopefully useful naman ang na-aral ko don... Wait.. kung galing sa Fajado, then magsearch tayo don..."

In response Urda said, "OK!"

But she continued to wonder if she was the one controlling time as, she was looking at the clock and it was moving wherever she thinks, 5,4,3 PM, anything really but it was kinda liberating, but she needed to find out how it works...

Though, as she thought that, Mijo found the source. The Biolab. But as soon as they opened the door... It wasnt the same biolab they left when they were... Alive? But, with nothing left to explore or find, they went in..

*Game has been started*

Immediately skeletons raise from the ground... They didnt look friendly. Both of them drew their swords and started fighting.. First, Mijo slashed through the skeletons, but found out that swords are really hard to wield, he eventually fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Urda with her insane reaction time managed to dodge and shoot all skeletons and stabbed one dire

# C2p1 DeltaRambles: School Chess Game

Summary: Chess Game in school and shenanigans happen.

Author's Note: uh yeah just wanted to play chess and decided this is a great chance to write something. So i hope you enjoy it! BTW might not be inline with the canon this was based on but yeah!

Mijo steps into the school, and begins walking to class and after opening the door and taking a seat:

JR said, "Hello Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Hi! Uh so what you doin' "

JR said, "Reviewing for AP quiz later... Have you reviewed?"

Mijo said, "No... I am right now!"

JR said, "Ok..."

Then JR talked to someone else and Mijo decided to sit and review until Urda showed up and got Mijo's attention.

Urda spoke up, "Hey... Mijo, So meron akong sasabihin sayo na dapat tayo lang may alam..."

Mijo said, "Ok... Hmmm what's it?"

Urda said, "So, meron ka bang nakaranas na dark world?"

Mijo said, "Uhh, yes???? You did too? I thought panaginip lang 'yon!"

Urda said, "Yun din isip ko, pero it was too na real at di ko pa nakakalimutan eh..."

Mijo said, "Well, ano na gagawin natin?"

Urda said, "Well, kung magkapareho ang pagbukas sa deltarune sa dito.. Pwede natin gawin ngayon?"

Mijo said, "Hmm, gusto mo?"

Urda said, "Oo naman, na-obsess nako don, meron nga kong drawing at iba pa, diba ikaw din?"

Mijo said, "Oo, ako din-"

Then, Jamise interrupted: "Hey! So ayaw ko interrupt yung bonding time niyo, pero pinapapunta na tayo sa gym"

Mijo and Urda both stared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After following Jamise, and heading outside of the class, into the gym but then suddenly darkness spews out of the door near the chemist lab that was near the pathway to the gym and at first all of them were surprised but then Urda and Mijo quickly ran towards it and jumped into the chemist lab and as Jamise was chasing them: "Hey! Stop!!!". But as Jamise stared into the abyss, she decided to jump in as her friends were there and the flag raising ceremony was gonna be boring anyway and so she decided to jump and fall.

*darker, yet darker*

Mijo and Urda both fell at the same time but as soon as they landed, they saw that they were in some kind of black and white board and looked around to see: Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn! It was chess!!! But instead it was too big and so they had to make a choice: white or black?

Mijo spoke up, "Yo uhh what color should we choose?"

Urda said, "Uhhhhh, Di ako naglalaro ng chess?"

Mijo said, "White it is then!"

So they took the white pieces and started the game. They vaguely saw a person with black jacket, long hair and a staff playing the black pieces.

Urda said, "So, since di ako naglalaro ng chess, dito lang ako, manonood."

Mijo said, "Ok then, watch and learn!"

So the game started, white moves pawn to e4, black moves to e5, knight moves to f3, knight moves to c6, bishop to c4, knight to g5, pawn to h6, queen to h5, queen takes knight g5, queen takes pawn f7, king moves to d8 and queen takes bishop g8, checkmate!

"Thats... Checkmate! Why was that so easy, i mean... Who else trolls like that?", said Mijo.

"Probably Jamise, but i can't prove it!", said Urda.

"What? But-" said Mijo before getting cut off by that person playing black suddenly running towards them.

Mijo and Urda both readied up their defensive stances and watched as the figure eventually was visible enough to be... Wait.. isn't that Jamise?

Mijo and Urda calmed down, and talked to Jamise.

Jamise first spoke, "Hey? What was that for?"

<!--Chapter 2 Part 2-->
# C2p2 DeltaRambles: At the School: Chess Game
Author Notes: A friend helped me with this one

Summary: 

As Mijo, Urda and Jamise go into the dark world... The Pearlyshells are just chillin'

JR exclaimed, "Hmm, Mijo should be here..."

Leviente said, "Good point... Jam isnt here either..."

JR declared, "Ok, they should be here after the FRC..."

*1 hour later*

JR muttered, "They're not here... Something's fishy pero di ko alam kung bakit..."

*1 more hour later*

Rhida goes to JR and Leviente and speaks about someone...

Rhida worryingly said, "Soo, do you know asan si Jamise, Mijo at uhhh Urda?"

Leviente said "Nah.. Kala ko pag nag-quiz sa AP, pupunta na sila dito, pero wala pa sila!"

JR forenamed, "After the quiz AND snack break, they should be here but it appears they may have been missing!"

Lauvielle joined the conversation!

Lauvielle said, "Wait! Nakita ko sila, saaa room bago ako umalis! Late sila pumunta eh"

Rhida said, "Ok! Let's go find them!"

As they find their missing classmates as background music... JR started singing randomly in songs like Part of Your World and Under the Sea (Original Version)... For some reason. 

They stumble around, going to the music room, cafeteria, mang reyes, physic lab before finally arriving at the Chemistry Lab...

Lauvielle exclaimed, "Hmmm, it's 9:15 AM... Pero di bukas yung Chemistry Lab..."

Leviente responded, "Good point, pero di naman nakasara... At ang dilim!"

JR and Rhida nod in agreement.

Leviente said, "Well, tignan lang natin, andito na tayo..."

As the door creaked, the darkness encompassed the entire hallway they were on and they began to worry...

JR said, "Ok... Perfecto!" and jumped straight into the dark and somehow fell into the void.

Rhida screamed, "JR, wait!!!"

But it was too late, JR had already jumped off and the others decided to not tell anyone or go in until further notice.

Leviente said "Ok, everyone agrees that we should not come here until at least..."

Rhida spoke up, "uwian! 5:00 PM... But what if yung mga teachers ay tinatanong tayo?"

Lauvielle said, "Then we hide the bags and say na absent sila? Yun lang pwede na hindi obvious eh"

Rhida said, "Sige, sige..."

They went back to their classroom and soon enough, rumors started spreading that the chemistry lab was so dark, that not even light from outside could illuminate it and it even spread darkness but only then only a select small people specifically from 8-Clam confidently know but it got around to the teacher, she checked the cctv and found nothing, like literally just black from the hallway and the chemistry lab. Weird, guess the cctv is broken..

Lunch came and they decided to sneakily take Urda, Mijo and Jamise's bags to the Chemistry Lab where they threw it hopeful that they are there along with JR but they weren't sure and even if, it was the only spot that could hide something so they threw it there and left it until later.

Mam Arcea said, "Asan si Cara, Aman at si Rira?"

Rhida said, "Absent sila po! Um... May sakit po!"

Mam Arcea, "Ah, OK.... So-" and after that class continued...
