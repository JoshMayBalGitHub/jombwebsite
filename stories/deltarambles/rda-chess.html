# U DeltaRambles: Chess Game

Summary: Chess Game in school and shenanigans happen.

Author's Note: uh yeah just wanted to play chess and decided this is a great chance to write something. So i hope you enjoy it! BTW might not be inline with the canon this was based on but yeah!

Mijo steps into the school, and begins walking to class and after opening the door and taking a seat:

JR said, "Hello Mijo!"

Mijo said, "Hi! Uh so what you doin' "

JR said, "Reviewing for AP quiz later... Have you reviewed?"

Mijo said, "No... I am right now!"

JR said, "Ok..."

Then JR talked to someone else and Mijo decided to sit and review until Urda showed up and got Mijo's attention.

Urda spoke up, "Hey... Mijo, So meron akong sasabihin sayo na dapat tayo lang may alam..."

Mijo said, "Ok... Hmmm what's it?"

Urda said, "So, meron ka bang nakaranas na dark world?"

Mijo said, "Uhh, yes???? You did too? I thought panaginip lang 'yon!"

Urda said, "Yun din isip ko, pero it was too na real at di ko pa nakakalimutan eh..."

Mijo said, "Well, ano na gagawin natin?"

Urda said, "Well, kung magkapareho ang pagbukas sa deltarune sa dito.. Pwede natin gawin ngayon?"

Mijo said, "Hmm, gusto mo?"

Urda said, "Oo naman, na-obsess nako don, meron nga kong drawing at iba pa, diba ikaw din?"

Mijo said, "Oo, ako din-"

Then, Jamise interrupted: "Hey! So ayaw ko interrupt yung bonding time niyo, pero pinapapunta na tayo sa gym"

Mijo and Urda both stared at Jamise, but they had to go anyway. After following Jamise, and heading outside of the class, into the gym but then suddenly darkness spews out of the door near the chemist lab that was near the pathway to the gym and at first all of them were surprised but then Urda and Mijo quickly ran towards it and jumped into the chemist lab and as Jamise was chasing them: "Hey! Stop!!!". But as Jamise stared into the abyss, she decided to jump in as her friends were there and the flag raising ceremony was gonna be boring anyway and so she decided to jump and fall.

*darker, yet darker*

Mijo and Urda both fell at the same time but as soon as they landed, they saw that they were in some kind of black and white board and looked around to see: Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn! It was chess!!! But instead it was too big and so they had to make a choice: white or black?

Mijo spoke up, "Yo uhh what color should we choose?"

Urda said, "Uhhhhh, Di ako naglalaro ng chess?"

Mijo said, "White it is then!"

So they took the white pieces and started the game. They vaguely saw a person with black jacket, long hair and a staff playing the black pieces.

Urda said, "So, since di ako naglalaro ng chess, dito lang ako, manonood."

Mijo said, "Ok then, watch and learn!"

So the game started, white moves pawn to e4, black moves to e5, knight moves to f3, knight moves to c6, bishop to c4, knight to g5, pawn to h6, queen to h5, queen takes knight g5, queen takes pawn f7, king moves to d8 and queen takes bishop g8, checkmate!

"Thats... Checkmate! Why was that so easy, i mean... Who else trolls like that?", said Mijo.

"Probably Jamise, but i can't prove it!", said Urda.

"What? But-" said Mijo before getting cut off by that person playing black suddenly running towards them.

Mijo and Urda both readied up their defensive stances and watched as the figure eventually was visible enough to be... Wait.. isn't that Jamise?

Mijo and Urda calmed down, and talked to Jamise.

Jamise first spoke, "Hey? What was that for?"
