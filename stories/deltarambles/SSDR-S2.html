Summary: Starts off with a school story, ends with a dark world adventure. Like the old times right?

Author's Note: So, as of currently, the current pre-c3s2 stories have been merged due to me wanting a better story that also fits my current style, so if you were reading c2 it has been moved here, i am sure that you will enjoy this so see you soon, oh and the below is my previous author's note, i didn't have one for c2 btw.

So, there ya go, but i really want to keep this going, but the fact that I am not done with season 1 is kinda stressful and with school, oh man.. Anyways this one's short, because this is the first time i wrote on a notebook instead of a phone's notes app. Hopefully i can have bigger ones in the future. Adios!

It started off as a regular “first day of school”. Old friends like JR and Lauvielle and new classmates for the rest of the year.

Now, Mijo and with 8-Clam, were retired from the whole “dark world” ever since they had their “last supper”. Some of them were done with that type of adventure. Some moved out of the school, some got into bigger and better schools. The only ones still thinking about it were the first ones, Mijo and Urda. Now as “fate” would have it, they were separated.

As lunch time broke, JR and Mijo went to the railings near the classrooms, of course after eating their dinners.

“Hey JR, how's life?” said Mijo.

“It's bad, hahanapin ko yung ibang 8-Clam wanna join?” said JR.

“Yeah sure, hope no dark worlds open-“ said Mijo before a big explosion was heard coming from the bottom floor, as they were on the 2nd floor.

“Ugh, let's go save another dark world." said Mijo.

“I mean, hinahanap natin yung 8-Clam diba?” said JR.

Both of them laughed before quickly going downstairs and seeing the room nearest to the bottom CR.

“Ok, let's see what section's here…” said Mijo.

“9-Oxir…” said JR.

“Ok, hmmm…” said Mijo, searching around the students until…

“Oh, that's why,” said Mijo, pointing to Urda's full name.

“Ok, let's go in," said Mijo, before going in with JR.

“Wait Mijo-“ said JR before cutting himself off.

They woke up in a desert, with Urda and her new friend which Mijo recognized but couldn't remember the name of.

“Hey! Urda and…” said Mijo before getting cut off by-

“Wow, bro, does not remember my name?!?” said Reeb.

“Oh yeah! You're Reeb from Grade 7! I forgor” said Mijo.

“Bruh… We used to play Micnaft in a server!” said Reeb.

“Hi Reebs!” said JR.

“Hi JR!” said Reeb.

“Guys, let's go to the main point, who opened this world, Urda, was it you?” said Mijo.

“Ok, it was me, but like, i was explaining the dark world to Reeb but she wouldn't believe, so I opened one!” said Urda.

“To be fair, di ko siya talaga paniniwalaan, I mean, a dark world that exists? Impossible!” said Reeb.

“Weel that, and i kinda wanted to see what would happen, i honestly expected you, Mijo.” said Urda.

“Well, ok, lets just fix this situation, and go back. Lunch pa lang!” said Mijo.

“Then, we can go back?” said Urda.

“Yeah, yeah, just warn me next time.” said Mijo.

“Hey guys, not to be anti climactic, but andoon lang yung fountain.” said JR.

“Oh well lets go-“ said Mijo before getting cut off.

Two people appeared, they looked like two people who Mijo seen before with Lauvielle on occasion.

“Great, more people.” said Mijo.

“Lets just close the fountain and uh, forgot this happened.” said Urda.

“Wait, yo, why does our phones not work?” said Reeb.

“Yeah, no cell towers here.” said Mijo.

Then they went to the fountain and as they were about to close it,

“Hey, Reeb, what's your magic?” questioned Urda.

“Uh, let's see-“ said Reeb, opening up a menu that looks like… Micnaft?!

“Oh cool, can you make a- wait Mijo!” said Urda.

“What? I'm closing it, oh yeah, the powers? sure, let's see it, Reeb!” said Mijo.

“OK, wash, isn't this op?!” said Reeb, placing diamonds down.

“Yeah, but i bet it will be like super costly or very strong but only on certain worlds, i know it all, well not all, but enough.” said JR.

Then the two immediately met with the rest of the group.

“Hello, fellow people, you know how to get out of here?” said the girl.

“Hmm, wait isn't this what Lauvielle was saying about, like dark worlds or somethin!” said the boy.

“Oh yeah, and the fountain, so i'am guessing you guys know who Lauvielle is?” said the girl.

“Yeah, we, well most of us know who Lauvielle is. By the way, you guys know what your powers are?” said Mijo.

“Uh, we do?! Lets see,” said the girl before opening with a larger gun and a bayonet.

The boy also tried, getting a simple handgun.

“Oh cool, i don't know that!” said the girl.

“Hey guys, we should get going.” said JR.

“Ok, then.” said Mijo.

So the fountain is closing and then they all wake up, 5 PM. Damn it, they were way past over the afternoon class.

“Damn, well lucky chance, let's go home.” said Mijo.

“Ay, well let's go.” said Urda.

“Ok, everyone here, uh, don't talk, don't reveal, basically just don't talk about what happenned here. Ok? Ok. I'm, we are not helping you out if you do.” said Mijo.

“Got it, no words coming out of this girl!” said Reeb.

“Uh sure!” said the girl before getting out of the room.

“Yeah, ok!” said the boy before also going out.

“Oh, I gotta go, see ya' Mijo, Urda, and Reebs!” said JR.

“Yeah, I'am going too! See ya Urda and Mijo!” said Reeb before also going out.

“Uh, i gotta go. I'll be seeing you, soon?” said Urda.

“Yeah, bye!” said Mijo.

SO they both went home, and not together, as Urda went out first. Mijo went last, making sure things were in order.

The next day, Mijo starts out, looking out of a balcony, near the classroom, as the Wednesday cleaners clean inside.

He wonders to himself, the past few weeks, he made a new friends, reconnected with old ones, and he's set with a potential research title approved. But all through it he still remembers the dark world, even though a mishap happened during the first days of school, things slowed down and people focused on their schoolwork.

“Ah man, i wish i could do more but i've been busy and sick, all my friends are, well, busy too, I just wish that i had a chance, wait can't I make my own dark worlds? I've been inactive for this long!” as Mijo rants to himself, the Wednesday cleaners finish.

He decides to go down, because as he was ramblling to himself, the cleaners finished and went home.

The next day in school, he decides to think about it a little bit more, near his previous spot.

“Ok, so where exactly? Maybe the 9-Lit room? Like, where everybody is? But, I dont know what will happen, it could be bad, hmmm, maybe i could try during uwian, kasi it replicates the same situation as before and less people can ruin the secret, ok, thats-“ Mijo got cut off by a new friend of him called Ikari.

“Dude, what are you doing in the past hour? You just stand there and… What?” questioned Ikari.

“I have been thinking of plans, ok?” responded Mijo.

“Plans of what? World Domination?” said Ikari.

“No- something else secret, ok? Wait, actually, can you stay for a bit after dismissal?” said Mijo.

“Why- Oooh- You want me to help you in our AP Project? Well, the answer's no.” said Ikari.

“Please? So you have some ambag—“ said Mijo.

“Oo na nga, sige, sige.” said Ikari.

Then JR suddenly appeared shouting “Si Ma'am!” they all quickly went inside the classroom.

After two classes, it was time for class dismissal, Mijo, Ikari and a bunch of groupmates all actually did the group project but as more people went out of the classroom and went home. Mijo decided it was time.

“Ok guys, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the classroom and—“ said Mijo.

“Oh yeah, I also will be doing that, come on, Mijo.” said Ikari.

“Ok, then cool.” said Mijo.

So, off they go towards the classroom of 9-Lit. They eventually made it with little conversation as they both ran to the classroom. Ikari was first though, Mijo was second.

“Hah- you're second.” said Ikari.

“Yeah, yeah, ok. Wait.” said Mijo.

Then Mijo went to the middle of the classroom, got a ballpoint pen and stabbed the floor, filling the room with darkness.

“Yo, bro, what you doin' you just stabbed the floor and like dark air starts coming out?” said Ikari.

“Yeah, pretty much, now… wh— get prepared for the floor to dissapear.” said Mijo.

“WHAT!? Bro, I'am getting the hell out of here, won't you too?” said Ikari.

“Its too late, the floor, is already collapsing…” said Mijo.

“Bro—“ said Ikari before quickly hrabbing Mijo and quickly getting out of the classroom, but the floor already collapsed. Before both of them fell, they saw a dark sky with no sun or
moon. Only black.

*Darkness Returns*

Ikari woke up in a dark place, only a platform and connecting ones filled the empty world.

“Ugh, that fucker, really put us in this dark- wait, isn't this like, what happened during the first days and accounts from Lauvielle? Shoot, I am in a dark world.” said Ikari.

“Well, dapat naman siguro, merong daanan dito, ay- yung mga weapons ko!” said Ikari.

"Well, surely.. there must be a way— ay! my weapons!" said Ikari, now trying to find her weapon.

Ikari managed to grab her full rifle with detachable sword in the bottom of the gun.

“Oh, that's good, full gun with a free sword.” said Ikari, before moving throughout the floating platforms.

“I mean, dapat naman makita ko siya, kasi, at least sabi ni Lauvielle, naglalakad lang daw siya at nakikita na niya ang kaklase niya…” said Ikari.

"I mean, I should still see him, kasi, at least for Lauvielle, ahe walked until she saw her classmates so..." said Ikari, thinking about her conversations with Lauvielle.

After going through endless quizzes about school rules about drinking, smoking, bullying and more. She discovered a 2-story building with 5 rooms in each floor. A hallway allowed her to navigate each room.

“Well, I have no choice, is either that, or through those stupid quizzes again. Ok, I can do this…” said Ikari before entering the building and opening the door of the nearest room closest to her.

“Hello, anyone there?” said Ikari, to no one in an empty, but organized room.

She moved on to the next one, and the next, no one was there. It looked like she entered after everybody went home. She went upstairs and checked all the rooms to the left of her, no one. She checked the nearest right one, no one, but when she checked the next one…

“Ugh, everybody there?” said Ikari, tired.

“Yeah, that's me…” said Mijo, also tired.

“Woah, what the fuck dude, i almost had a fuckin panic attack hearin' your ass…” said Ikari, surprised.

“You're lucky, by the way, when i landed here, there were a bunch of enemies, like really tough ones, like bottlemen, bullet-hell people, a lot of that type.” said Mijo, while looking straight towards Ikari.

“Yeah, yeah… Hey, how did you open this… world, anyway, I though we were about to fuckin' die!” said Ikari.

“Look, If you heard it from Lauvielle, that means I have been here, before. However, it seems that I have been severely weakened by this world, so first time fighting for real.” said Mijo.

“Ok… That was a lot of yapping, but ok, so you know how this world works? Cool, get me out of here, I wanna go home.” said Ikari.

“No- like I know how they work, but this specific world? Only now, so you're gonna have to follow me.” said Mijo.

“Hey! Well, I guess? I kinda wanna go off on my own.” said Ikari.

“Well, if that's what you want, i also wanna explore and alone for the first time, too!” said Mijo.

“Ok, i guess I'll go to that city over there, have fun!” said Ikari, looking out of a window.

“Yep— you too.” said Mijo.

So both went their separate ways, but—

“Hey, wait- how do we go there?” said Ikari.

“Brute Force.” said Mijo, before slicing the wall in half and pushing it into the rubble below.

“Oh, ok. “ said Ikari before going out the same hole, but going towards a different part of the city.

It was vast and overwhelming for Ikari for even videogames can't prepare you for real, seeing a bunch of humanoid and monster-like beings walking around, though she would meet a familiar, yet strange person.

“Hey! You're a… I mean— Are you with Mijo?” asked Jomi.

“Uh, used to, if you're lookin' for him, he's somewhere in the city, i dont know where but somewhere… to the right of me.” said Ikari.

“Oh. jeez, ok. Uh so have you, like have you had magic-“ said Jomi.

“Yeah, yeah, I already have them, the gun and— wait— who are you anyway? You seem to know Mijo, and you—“ said Ikari.

“I look like him, i know, know. I am Jomi, the princess of the dark. I… met him, with his friends, before.” said Jomi.

“Oh, like, are you part of this world or are you with us?” said Ikari.

“I guess you can call me a part of this world, I am a princess of dark after all.” said Jomi.

“Nice, do you have an empire or a kingdom… or even a castle?” said Ikari.

“Yeah, I have a castle, unfortunately, you haven't seen my largest one in… another world, but I have one here, for some reason.” said Jomi.

“But, wait? I thought you lived here? Why would you have one somewhere else? Do you own multiple castles?” said Ikari.

“Yeah? Technically now, well, we should get going, we need to find him first, though, I can't let anyone stay here as the fountain closes.” said Jomi.

“Ok, sure, got nothing i can do anyway, hey— are there any cell—“ said Ikari.

“Cell service, none. You hear that? Sounds like music…” said Jomi.

“Should be a disco around here, oh hi. Jomi.” said Mijo.

“Oh my— finally,” Jomi runs up to Mijo and said “I have been looking for you in, hours!” said Jomi.

“Yeah, yeah- You're gonna serrmoon me about how irresponsible at mapanganib ang ginawa mo' at papauwi mo kami?” said Mijo.

“Yeah, yeah— You're gonna serrmoon me about how 'irresponsible and dangerous' I am and how you're sending us home no?" said Mijo, in a mocking tone, both a bit annoyed and angry.

“Well, yes. But like, don''t you wanna go home?” said Jomi.

*Silence.*

Then Mijo said “No, NO! I… realized that through all of it, I enjoyed being a hero or just bonding with friends. School life's monotonous and boring.” said Mijo.

“Ay, me too. But how do we get out of here? My dad's gonna be pissed…” said Ikari.

“Yeah, uh you have to help her, its like kind bad to trap her here. just go, we have to discuss this matter later.” said Jomi.

“Ugh, fine. Only her, though. I wanna stay here.” said Mijo.

“No- Mijo you don't understand— You have to go with her. Now.” said Jomi,

*Silence.*

Then after looking down and looking like he's about to contemplate his existence, sadly nodded and looked to Jomi, looking dejected and sad.

"..." then Jomi sighs, then says, "Ok, a deal's a deal. I promise, you can come back. Not now, but soon." then she quietly brings them to her castle in which the fountain is. As they stand before the fountain, Ikari speaks up.

"So... how does this work again?" questioned Ikari, looking at the fountain flow from the bottom to the sky above.

"I am sure you'll eventually know, but for now, hold that question." said Jomi, as she nudged Mijo to close the fountain. Then he gave his heart and light blinds everyone, afterwards both woke up at their respective seats.

"Ugh, oh.. It was a dream.. Just a dream..." said Ikari to herself as she looked around and saw Mijo next to her.

"Hey, hello? Uh—" said Ikari, before checking her phone and realizing it was time to go, got her things and woke up Mijo.

"Hey! How did you sleep like that? We just ran one mile, anyway, bye!" said Ikari before exiting out of class and going home.

As he watches Ikari exit, he also picks up his things and after that, closes the classroom, then he goes to the railings and looks to the school, contemplating that whole encounter. He decides to go home as well, as his dad finally arrives at the school.

For the next few months, he decides to follow Jomi's advice and go on about his life, making friends, suffering in school, etc. Ikari forgot about the whole thing, seeing it as a weird dream she had that one time, until one random conversation in breaktime happened...

"Sometimes, I wish there was a way of avoiding things here... or even resting! Honestly, with the work we get put under, how are we expected to last until Christmas!" ranted Ikari, as she was angry about something about the school.

"Yeah, I agree.." said Mijo, but then he thought to himself, "Wait, what about the dark world.. Does she remember? A good way to test that—"

"Hey dude, you okay? You suddenly looked like you were worried and thinking about something.." questioned Ikari, as she picked up her phone.

"Ah! Oh, sorry. Do you know who.. Jomi is?" said Mijo, looking at Ikari very seriously.

"Hmm, hmm, Nope! Sorry, but whoever that is, it sounds like a made-up name by parents who couldn't think of a way to combine names..." said Ikari, smiling as she also started to play a game on her phone.

"Right, I am going around, talk to you soon!" said Mijo, as he stood up and went to JR.

"Ok!" responded Ikari, as she now focused on the game on her phone, something about space trains.

"Hey JR and Lauvielle, what are y'all talking about?" said Mijo, looking at them.

"We were supposed to be talking about our research, but *she* got off-topic." said JR, staring at Lauvielle.

"Hey! We were.. Anyways, any new _tea_ for us?" said Lauvielle, now looking at Mijo with an excited look on her face.

"Nothing new, but an old one. The **_Dark World_.**" said Mijo, surprising the two of them.

"The dark world? Oh yeah!! That world where I was an arch mage that both heals and kills!" said JR, now excited about something ever since he got his new phone.

"Oh, yeah. The one where I had a bomb and a sword. Honestly, the only times where LV wasn't with me are the only good memories now.." said Lauvielle, feeling a mix of emotions; from being angry, sad and happy at the events before.

"Aww, I am sure you can get over him. Anyways, you can open one, right? Because I always wanted to go back, but I don't know how yet and I never got the chance to, and I didn't wanna ask you, since you probably changed your opinions ever since when Urda opened hers." said JR, telling his thoughts about the dark world.

"Yeah. I think I know the perfect place. Want to guess where?" said Mijo, smiling and putting his hands behind his back.

"The room?" guessed JR, thinking about suitable places.

"Not now, but good idea. But not now." responded Mijo, looking at the people in the classroom.

"The computer lab?" guessed Lauvielle, also thinking about suitable places.

"Close, which one?" questioned Mijo, now forming a big smile.

"*Gasp* WAIT, THE 2ND ONE?! The room next to us?!" said the both of them at the same time.

"Yep, let's go to it now. The room's unused and no one will notice." said Mijo, now looking towards the computer lab, contemplating something.

"Hey, wait, Isn't the room locked? How are we supposed to get in?" questioned Lauvielle, as she stood up with JR.

"Great question, luckily some chairs are being moved for some event, so lets use this opportunity to move in and I'll tell Jomi to make a key that can enter the computer lab and give it to you." said Mijo, pointing to JR as the key holder.

"Ohh right. The event... Anyways— lemme make sure my things are ok, we'll go near the door once we're done." said Lauvielle, as they both went to their bags to get something.

"Ok!" said Mijo, then as Lauvielle and JR focused on their bags, Mijo said to himself, "Now to get Ikari on board..." He went near Ikari's seat and sat down, looking at her then she looked at him.

"Ugh, I have been trying to get my research partners here, since we both have free time and yet they still haven't come.. Fucking seen-ers." ranted Ikari to Mijo as she checked her phone again.

Then at the door is Urda and Reeb, calling Ikari to go outside so they can talk.

"Wait, It's them? Perfect." thought Mijo, as he got lucky that almost all of the people know about the dark world, and that they wouldn't tell.

"Finally! Took you long enough!" shouted Ikari, as she went to them to talk about their robotic research.

"Hey! Mijo! Let's go." called JR to Mijo, as him and Lauvielle stood at the classroom door.

"Right, let's go." responded Mijo as he went to them and then all of them exited the classroom, then headed to the door of the computer lab.

"Computer Lab Two.." said Mijo, before going in with his friends. Then, they closed the room before he got his pencil then stabbed the ground giving rise to the darkness that eventually consumed the room.

"So, this is the prototype, of the robot that can save people from natural disasters. Okay? Now all we have to do is write some answers to some questions..." explained Ikari as Urda tunes her out looking behind her and seeing Mijo enter the computer lab two.

"He— Hey! Are you listening, Urda?" said Ikari, seeing Urda not paying attention.

"Oh, uh yes. Of course! So like we need to answer those so we can try to approve the title tomorrow?" said Urda, now focusing and looking at Ikari.

'Pretty much... Look, I'll just send some questions, and you can *answer* them, now go home or something, I don't care." said Ikari, as she went inside to pick up her bags.

"Hey, Urda, wanna go home?" questioned Reeb to Urda as she also looked at her.

"Uhhh, let's go inside the computer lab." answered Urda as she looked more closely at the lab.

"Oh? Ok!" said Reeb, then afterwards the both of them went closer to the lab.

"Woah, a dark world? Wait, how did— how did he make one and *not* produce a huge explosion?!" said Urda, as she looked inside and saw nothing but darkness.

"Well, what are we waiting for?? Let's go!" said Reeb before she went in.

"Ok, don't disappoint me, Mijo." said Urda, as she also went in.

"Wha— where are they?" said Ikari, before she looked to her left and saw Urda go into the lab.

"Huy! Wai— Huh? What the—" said Ikari as she ran to Urda and saw the inside of the lab.

"Heh? Wait, I... Uh, I feel deja vu... Hmph, she thinks that she can get away? I'll show her!" said Ikari, as she jumps in as well.

"Huh? What is this, eh? Wait! It feels familiar, I can't remember it though..." said Ikari to herself as she stood up from her fall. She notices a group of people talking about something.

"Eh? Those people, they.. hmm, I should approach them, but just in case.." said Ikari, before she prepared her gun, noticing that they looked familiar but radically different.

"Hey! I thought we had an agreement..? Like, it was implied that if one of us were to make a dark world, we would warn each other?" questioned Urda as they stood in a cyber platform.

"Hey! What's going on here? Where are we?!" said Ikari to the group.

"Uh, well first of all, I'm so sorry, Urda. I.. was about to but then I saw you were busy with your research, so I figured you'd know anyway. Uh speaking of that, uh Ikari, hmmm..." said Mijo as Urda nods and looks at Ikari.

"Oh, Ikari's here, uh why? Are you here.. wait. Did you make another one before this!?" said Urda as the group now turns their attention to Ikari and her question.

"Um, well yes— and uh Ikari! We.. are in a dark world, yeah, and it seems to be a CyberWorld that has elements of illusions or something based on the amount of enemies that seem to be dream-related." said Mijo as the group nodded.

"Oh, uh.. I remember now! Didn't we go on one, but Jomi kicked us out?" said Ikari, as the group stared at Mijo.

"Uhh guys! Calm down, um. Yeah like she said, we got sucked into one, and Jomi had to.. rescue us, yeah." said Mijo, as Ikari visibly doubts Mijo.

"Mijo, didn't you stab the ground..? Like sure we got sucked in, but you started it." said Ikari, as the group collectively questioned Mijo, a bunch of voices started piling up until...

"Hold on, hold! One at a time please! Yes, i did do it, I regretted it ok? Jomi explained why.. Anywho, as for the deal, yes I also forgot about that so SORRY!" said Mijo, before he walked away, visibly shaken and almost crying.

"Um.. Huh. So, what do we do then?" said Ikari, as the group is silent.

"We.. should discuss other things, I know him, he uh.. he tends to calm down after a while.. So. this dark world, I think I know what this one is based off, it's..." said Urda, trying to keep the group together.

Meanwhile at Mijo and his thoughts; near the group but far away so that the group's voices are unintelligible.

"I.. don't know why I burst out like that.. Is my development wasted? or I just.. forgot? I don't know anymore... I have to recollect my thoughts and feelings, right now. Before... this world, it seems good on the outside but it looks like the type that would easily manipulate vulnerabilities sneakily. So—" 

"Hey, uh you good? Because we are going now." said Ikari, as Mijo turns around and sees Urda waving hello.

"Y-yeah.. Sure. Um, sorry about that. I am sure the group has filled you in the details right?" said Mijo as Ikari and him walked to the group.

"Yeah, so uh what you missed is... that the world seems nice but is actually bad on the inside, that was the conclusion of Urda and the others, I mean I don't know, I've only been in one and well... you know.." said Ikari, as they walked with the group to the city ahead.

"Yeah, that makes sense. Anyways, we should see what's happening, they have stopped walking.." said Mijo as the group was staring at somebody.

"Hello, lightners! I see that you have come bearing your arms and are on the way to the dark fountain, hmm? Well just so you know, I, the queen will stop you!" said the person that called themselves 'queen'.

"Uh, what's your actual name though? I want to know for archive purposes.." said Mijo as the group stared at disbelief.

"Oh? So you want my full name?? Well my full name is 81LK00HDUS, as I am a computer.. obviously." said the queen, as the group collectively lost their minds.

"Ya know what, this sounds familiar, but I will decide to call you... Lukara, yep. That's the one, I'm just going to write that down..." said Mijo, as the group calmed down.

"Uh, so are you gonna fight us... or?" said Urda as Lukara now looks at Urda.

"Noope! Why would I waste time here, come on trailblazers, there is much of the city, enjoy while it lasts! Oh and have fun with my minions, see ya!" said Lukara before she left and left her minions,  to deal with the lightners.

"Did she just call us trail—" said Ikari, before the battle started with the minions.

"What are they called anyway?? If It's a stupid name, like prammes or progs, I am going to stab the nearest darkner here.." said Lauvielle as JR shields them from incoming damage.

"Hehe, Ikari! You're up. Kill those for us!" said Urda as Ikari gets pushed to the front of the group.

"Ah! What— Hey! Um, I have a gun. That might work—" said Ikari, before shooting it accidentally on a minion damaging it slightly.

"Girl, you are not used to wielding a gun, here imma help you!" said Urda as Reeb decided to intervene in place of Ikari, shooting her crossbows towards the minions, killing them.

"Oh, I thought this was my kill, but whatever, I still need to figure out how this thing works.." said Ikari before Urda started teaching her how to wield a gun as the group moved.

Summary: Broken hearts and feelings, make way for the new era. Things change, and these adventurers have to now face it.

Author's Note: As you can probably tell, I moved the current c2s2 arc to c1s2 because one, i thought that the first one was too short, and two, I've always wanted a bigger story between c2 and c3, seeing as I made them in-story about half a year long so a lot of things should had happened and this chapter is for that, and so this is also a w.i.p. so watch out and see you when i see you, bye!

An alarm is ringing as Mijo awakes to another distressing day...

"Ah shi— Ugh, I swear every time I wake up.. I— hold on, I should probably rush." said Mijo as he goes and prepares his stuff then goes to school.

"Bye-bye dad!" said Mijo to his dad, named June. His dad silently waves as both of them separate for the day. He got his bag down, then went straight for the dark world, now situated at the ever always empty computer lab.

"I.. do not know how to express it, but ever since our 'separation'.. I just felt empty..? Look I know that I have Ikari, I know I still have the others, it's just that.. fun with her." said Mijo, as he talked to Jomi, now his part-time therapist for some reason.

"Mhm, are you still.. not over with.. _Rhida?"_ questioned Jomi, now looking over the training field.

"He— Hu— Uh.. I do not know... My feelings remain conflicted as it did the last time we met.. I honestly do not know, I've been thinking about it.." said Mijo as they sat in a royal hangout place.

"This isn't your usual place, Mijo. I thought you would be.. playing outside?" said Jomi, now looking at Mijo.

"Uh, I just don't feel good today, after the last one yesterday, things have calmed down, and they have been focusing on the domains you made, I said to them that I'll be resting for today, and find me at Jomi's if needed. Also, choice of words, there Jomi." explained Mijo, as he looked at the training field, where JR and Lauvielle are seen talking about something, Ikari about to enter another domain, and Urda and Rhida talking near a domain entrance.

"Don't feel good..? Hmm, that's weird, don't you usually rest after dark worlds, like the other ones, even if it's for.. example, like a PT, because you would and could do them, since you said yourself after that massive battle, it caused you to have to take a break from normal activity and rest for 3 days, like a sick person." said Jomi, now thinking over some books.

"Yeah, I guess, it's about this, and that dreaded coming of the mass demo where there are 3 potential things we have to practice over a month." said Mijo as he lays down on the couch.

"Good luck, I heard that it was hard before, I guess yearly pains?" said Jomi, now picking up a RoyalCo Drink.

"Yes, they haven't even started yet, and they're probably gonna rush through two weeks again. I honestly do not know what to do about that too, ugh everything is tiring..." ranted Mijo, as Jomi looks at Mijo.

"Your life is.. very hard no? You always have to expect the unexpected in the dark worlds as well as deal with the usual stress that comes in being a high schooler.. Huh, I guess that does make life interesting but—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupts.

"—it sure is better than any other option, like imagine if I was so done with my life that I made like a novel that is just this?" said Mijo, unintentionally breaking the fourth wall.

"Well, if you did, are you sure it'll be as unexpected and sudden as this is?" said Jomi, continuing the topic.

"Yeah! Well, I am writing a.. like a diary of this world so—" said Mijo before realizing something.

"Well, you're looking at her. Let's go back to the topic, since you're clearly distracting yourself with novels to cope with the current events. Let's start at Rhida, because.. that's the first one you came to me about." said Jomi, as she pours more RoyalCo.

"Uh, yeah sure... I just... *exasperated sigh* I.. don't.. know?! Ok, like there's this weird dynamic where like every time we look at each other, one of us quickly looks away.. It's weird! And I don't know what to make of it! Like, just like a couple of months after and.. we can't even look at each other?!" said Mijo, feeling lost and confused.

"I.. see. Hmm, well I know this sounds _cliché_ but, like go to her? Seriously.. there's no possible way to get this off your mind, especially here, since she and I collaborated on the domains, so take your chances while it's hot!" said Jomi, as she takes a sip of RoyalCo.

"Mmm... About that. See, there's this feeling, that I can't brush off, what will be her reaction? Will she avoid me? I also have been friends with Ikari, for a while now. And I can't just— ugh... You're supposed to be the more caring, logical side.. Yet, as powerful or even as smart as I can be, I still suck at these parts..." said Mijo, as he takes a cup and pours one RoyalCo for himself.

"Well, there's no better way. I mean, at least you have a conclusion if you gauge what she feels..." said Jomi, as she finished her cup.

"I.. ok, um.. As for the others, I have.. to think about it, but I am energized again. Thanks, Jomi." said Mijo, as he finished his cup, and got up from his chair.

"You're welcome. Go now. I still have a bit more time to myself." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and left.

" *big sigh* All of them.. They have so many problems.. Not even a magical place can take away the problems of their lives.. In fact, it just adds more, but.. *turns to Urda and Mijo talking, with Lauvielle and JR joining in* at least, they're having fun." said Jomi to herself, as she drank a lot of RoyalCo. Then as she pours herself another one, someone knocks at the door.

"Hey..? This is Rhida, can I come in?" said Rhida from outside the door, before Jomi noticed and opened. "Hey~" said Jomi, as they went into the room, and she closed the door.

"So.. what brings you here..? The domains..? or just to talk?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida sits down on the same chair that Mijo was on.

"Haha.. The domains are actually going fine.. But, real talk, sis. You know who." answered Rhida, as Jomi pours a RoyalCo into her cup. "You want?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida politely asked for water instead.

"So.. Mmm.. What, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as she poured Rhida a cup of water. "Um.. I already spoke to some of my friends, but since you're so close to him, and well, you're a friend too, I just wanted to ask.. Is.. he avoiding me?" questioned Rhida, as she drinks the cup of water.

Jomi makes a big sigh at this question and Rhida quickly adds, "Um.. I know how bad it sounds, but you can understand me, right? As you said.. *stops* *exasperated sigh*  to talk to you if I have any problems, and.. I think this is important."

She stops, stares at Mijo and Urda then turns to Rhida, staring seriously, before she says, "He.. is.. mm... not avoiding you.", after carefully saying these words, she stares out again, drinking a shot of RoyalCo.

"R—really? But.. mmm.. it's weird, after the big battle and our moving up, he just seems to avoid me.. Every time I look vaguely in his direction, even when he was with JR earlier..." said Rhida, as Jomi sits down in front of her. Rhida continues, "Although, it's not like he's actively walking away, but.. he'll coincidentally be looking at something else or doing something just as I look at him, I find that.. disappointing."

"I'm sure he feels the same way too.. It's just, none of you express it well." said Jomi, as she sits down. "Oh.." Rhida trails off, her mind swirling with thoughts. "It's just something I've observed, don't take it like it's an.. insult or anything, I just.. want to help you with him." adds Jomi, drinking another shot of RoyalCo.

Rhida stays silent, the room tensing up a bit. "I.. understand.. You're supposed to be the third party that is observing from a distance, so any.. biases and emotions are off." Rhida sighs as she poured and drank more water. "Well.. can't say that I am not biased, nor do I not have emotions at play.. But, I am just giving what I think, as a good companion to both of you." Jomi gets another bigger glass and pours more RoyalCo. "This.. softdrink, it's calming." Jomi drank it all. "Sometimes, that can mean **I can** be conflicted even though there's a clear wrong or right."

"I.. understand. I am just happy that you're here for us, and the rest of the group. Even with all your past trauma." said Rhida, as she drank more water. "Thank you for understanding." Jomi drinks more RoyalCo.

<p id="C3"><md-block># C3 DeltaRambles: The New Intramurals</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: After the school announced the second intramurals in a year, Mijo came up with a new way of using sports through the dark world's magic but unexpected events happen and he and his friends fall to another dark world...

Author's Note: Not sure yet, where to put this but it's definitely late game. Also just a little bit inspired by real life events, just a little.

An alarm is ringing as Mijo realizes that he's almost definitely gonna be late...

"Shi- not again..." said Mijo as he quickly tried to rush his morning school routine.

He tried to, but in the end, he was late by a couple of minutes, as he heard the flag raising ceremony happen, he knew he was late but had to go somewhere. After moving through the hallway and towards the stairway leading up to his classroom, he puts his bags at his seat then quickly dashes to the computer laboratory next to his classroom. As it was unused, this had been where they set up the dark world.

"Ok, I'm here, let's see if it's open." said Mijo as he looked inside the glass door.

"Yep, ok let's go." said Mijo as he jumped in and  landed in a cyber city, full of computers and there he met Jomi.

"Hi! Jomi, i was a little bit late, sorry!" said Mijo.

"I.. expected that, but still.. you _should_ have gone here a bit earlier like 6:30?" said Jomi.

"Right, sorry again, you know.. parents, and me not sleeping-" said Mijo.

"-at the right time, yes, you should have known to not sleep at 3, isn't that right?" said Jomi.

"Ye- Yeah... Look, i want to discuss with you, the plan i was saying last week.." said Mijo.

"Oh? Ok. What is it, you also said you were bringing your friends..." said Jomi.

"Oh! They must be finishing up, i might need them, i will come back very soon, wait here, ok?" said Mijo.

"Fine. But seriously plan everything, if you keep getting overwhelmed like this..." said Jomi.

"Yeah.. yeah.." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"Ah ok, so it should be- ah crap, I am probably absent because of the whole protection of the dark thing, so uh.. Hmm what are they doing there anyway..." said Mijo.

"So any more announcements? No? Well you all can go back to your classrooms now!" said the person at the stage with a mic.

"Oh no, if they see me... They would have known I didn't attend.. shit! Uh uh, aha! I just have to.. message them at the gc... Right, how could i forget about that, anyways.." said Mijo as he opens his phone and types:

Mijo: @everyone, so uh i am not absent, i just didn't attend the FRC, but the reason is we have a group meeting in the dark world. Anyone available can join, thank you all!!!

"Ok that should, be good. Now it's time to explain to Jomi why they aren't here yet." said Mijo.

Mijo jumps in again then meets Jomi.

"Hey..." said Mijo.

"And where's your friends, hmm?" said Jomi.

"Uhh, they're on their way... Hopefully." said Mijo.

"Hopefully? Sure. But have you actually formulated anything about any plan regarding.. whatever you're thinking about, or you came here to ask me..?" said Jomi.

"Ehe~ yep. I.. I have a plan, just an incomplete one..." said Mijo.

"Oh? Then what is it?" said Jomi.

"Ok, so i got the idea when, they announced the intramurals for this week, and I wanted to replicate that but in the dark world, but I don't know where to start, as there are a lot of factors that i think you can only answer." said Mijo.

"Interesting. What about your friends, besides being the competitors, i assume..?" said Jomi.

"Oh yeah, exactly what you're thinking. Some of them competitors, some facilitators, they choose." said Mijo.

"Hmm, how many? You know i have to make room, food, utilities, and other materials for the sports and.. that takes time." said Jomi.

"Hmm, right now, about only 60 people know of a dark world and have been in one, and most of them are my friends. So that? Though, i want more." said Mijo.

"Well, how many? I think we can still fit those.. 'guaranteed' people, even with extra stuff." said Jomi.

"Hehe, now that's a problem because... I don't know how many, because i want to ask-" said Mijo.

Then suddenly behind them, a bunch of people appeared; JR, Lauvielle, and Ikari.

"He- Hey, Mijo! I.. just came here and.. what is it you wanted to meet about.." said JR, exhausted.

"Yeah, i had to catch up, as _JR_ was running..." said Lauvielle.

"Oh yeah, don't forget about me! I had to run as well!" said Ikari.

"I.. probably shouldn't have rushed you guys, but-" said Mijo.

"It's about the intramurals, i take it you all would have heard about it?" said Jomi

"Yeah, but why? What did you want to ask that relates here?" questioned Ikari.

"So, I want to make the intramurals but here, in the dark world." said Mijo.

"Huh? Now, uh you got a plan for that, Mijo?" said Ikari.

"Hehe, now... That's why y'all are here..." said Mijo.

"Now, that idea looks fun! Mijo, but uh we need a break... Some of them also should arrive like... Leviente... Or Rhida? I don't know dude..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh can we go to your CPU castle, Jomi?" said JR.

"Sure. We'll continue it there, I have some tables and chairs set up already. You all go ahead without us, I have a word to speak to Mijo..." said Jomi.

"Ok!" said Lauvielle, Ikari, and RJ as they head to the castle, walking.

"Ok now you, Mijo, 'Plan'?" said Jomi.

"Uh what do-" said Mijo.

"I said a word to you, now i will speak words instead." said Jomi.

"Jomi!? Let's get serious, please?" said Mijo.

"Yeah yeah, so about that participants thing, how?" said Jomi.

"I.. will find a way." said Mijo.

"Don't tell me you are making a dark world in the gymnasium!" said Jomi.

"Well, that was one, but-" said Mijo.

"But? You know there's a reason why you made it a whole secret and there's magic involved-" said Jomi as they pass the castle's gates.

 "Yeah, yeah, that's stupid. But, what room can i even use, it's not like i can keep making it here, in cyber city. I have to find a perfect spot, somewhere around the school..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, now I don't know, but you'll have to see for yourself. Anyways, we're here." said Jomi.

"Wow, you- you changed a lot in the castle ever since making this my main dark world...." said Mijo.

"Yeah, yeah. Though i have noticed the amount of darkners that are 'visitors' from another land have increased..." said Jomi.

"Hmm, is it anything to do with the increase of students in the computer lab?" said Mijo.

"Probably, I don't mind it, they're usually fine people. I was just curious. Anyways we should head inside." said Jomi.

"A'ight.." said Mijo.

They headed inside to see the others talking at the table.

"I always wondered why it was so fast to go from there to here..." said Mijo.

"Magic, well- more like my castle is just really close to the destination." said Jomi.

"Wait, then like, how do you respond to the visitors?" said Mijo.

"Oh, well.. notice how we passed by the gate while we're talking?" said Jomi.

"There was a gate..? Sorry, Jomi, i just tend to miss some things..." said Mijo.

"I noticed. Anyway, that's closed when I order it to be closed so the visitors would have to go around to the city first." said Jomi.

"Oh ok.. uh hey let's greet them!" said Mijo.

"Hi! Mijo! We were just talking about random stuff." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, like how Lauvielle keeps yapping about Leviente's neck pillow..." said Ikari.

"Hey! I- It's important!" said Lauvielle, a bit flustered.

"So what did you want to talk about Mijo?" said JR.

"Uh, so about here, it's something to do with the intramurals." said Mijo.

"Like the one announced earlier and in the gc?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, like that but here, with magic and cool shit." said Mijo.

"Ah, ok. Uhm, so how?" said JR.

"Hehe, now that's the thing, I don't know!!" said Mijo.

"Ugh..." said Jomi as she facepalms. "We have already discussed some parts, he said he wants you guys to be either facilitators or players." said Jomi again.

"Can it be both?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, Mijo! Answer the question." said Jomi.

"Uh, yeah! As long as someone else is also facilitating." said Mijo.

"So, we have two per.. game. Hmmph, we need more people." said Jomi.

"Hmm, can we ask our other classmates? From our section?" said JR.

"Yeah! I'm planning on accommodating a lot of people. Hmm how many are in the dark world gc?" said Mijo.

"Uh, I don't remember, and we can't check it here..." said Ikari.

"Oh no... Well we have to go back but we might get spotted..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, aren't the grade 7's finally using this room, Mijo?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Right. Um, wait, when do they go here?" Said Mijo.

"Uh, we should go right now, because they can arrive anytime and discover this.. and I do not trust those *children*." said JR.

"But- ugh, fine. Let's go, we can talk about this after school. Y'all have like, delayed pick up driver?" said Mijo.

"I do, but i know that JR usually goes early and it's Monday so..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh- i was gonna say in the gc, but we haven't even informed the rest of them that we have a plan now.." said JR.

"Yep, um, i guess we'll be here uh.. Mijo! You inform JR of our agreements later ok?" said Ikari.

"Got it, let's just—" said Mijo.

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of monsters from the abyss start pounding on the castle's gates. It can be heard all the way to the inside of the castle.

"Ugh, abyss monsters. I don't know why or how they're here but they have raised their activity a lot these past few weeks." said Jomi.

"Well, uh we'll see then hehe, we have to go back so let's kill those monsters!" said Mijo.

"Yeah!" said everybody else.

So all of them headed out of the castle and Jomi decided to open the gates, by saying "Open the gates! Execution Mode!" as some darkners came to fight the monsters.

"What is it, your highness?" said a darkner.

"Kill these abyss monsters, right now." said Jomi.

"Yes, your highness, we shall." said a darkner as they charged into battle.

"Damn, you got an entire army and you're a leader? You have a lot of subjects now." said Mijo.

"Yep, you better go, don't waste our manpower here." said Jomi.

"Ok guys, let's go!" said Mijo before his group attacked the monsters left and right. The group moved through waves of abyss attack, for some reason, more than they had anticipated but they arrived at the light tunnel.

"Ok, that was a bit much. Where did they all come from???" said Ikari.

"The abyss, duh." said Lauvielle.

"Hey—" said Ikari.

"Wait, yeah but more and more the monsters are increasing in their attacks... There might be a catalyst outsider. Just, watch out, all of you." said Jomi.

"Ok, well guys let's-" said Mijo as the others went up.

"Rude. Anyways, bye Jomi! See you later!" said Mijo as he went up.

"Something might happen during the next few days, but I am not sure what it is, before they arrive, I must investigate myself." said Jomi as she goes back into battle.

"Hey guys!" said Mijo as he meets his friends, waiting for him.

"You're here, let's go. It's lunch so we have our school time cut in half." said JR.

"That's nice, well let's eat," said Mijo as he looked to his back, seeing the normal computer lab.

"Yep, let's go." said JR as all of them went their separate ways of eating lunch.

"Anyways, the amount of monsters is interesting, to say the least. But I have to eat so let's think about that later." whispered Mijo to himself as he went and got his food.

"Oh nice, dry chicken with rice and cut hotdog. Hmm, you know, if i only didn't prioritize eating as fast as possible i would have disliked this and the variety too. Anyways, I am just gonna eat now." said Mijo to himself as he looks at this food as he prepares it.

He eats food and after a while, he finishes and pulls out his diary that he doesn't call a diary.

"Alright, so abyss monsters, hmm what type though... Ooh! I saw one that has scythes, what else...  Hmm, i saw one that was just a big guy with an axe... Ok, ano pa ba... Aha! I know! It looks like a two legged beast that has arms that shoot fireballs, or i think it was just rockets... Well, that should be some of the enemies i encountered there.." said Mijo again, to himself as he writes it all down on his diary / notebook / whatever he calls it.

"Hey, Mijo, whatcha doing there.." said Ikari.

"Oh just, writing. Um... why?" said Mijo.

"Oh, nothing. Just bored. Anywho, i know you didn't attend the morning classes, that's why i got us a *Reviewer*." said Ikari.

"You want us, to review? I mean, if there were quizzes we could just—" said Mijo.

Then outside the classroom, a bunch of grade 7's are approaching the computer lab in a line, and all slowly go inside.

"—go into the dark world..." said Mijo as he realized something.

"Yeah, no, it's not an option anymore... Well, you said you could make dark worlds, soo why not here..?" said Ikari.

"Hmm, that's a last resort, also, I.. just don't want more people knowing about it..." said Mijo.

"Ok, well we better review or you might have to forego your secret haha.." said Ikari.

"Hehe, yeah. Let's do it." said Mijo as he put away his 'notebook'.

As they reviewed, eventually time passes and it's time for class. First they had a quiz, and then another quiz. After that, the class was dismissed.

"Goodbye, mam Sant!" said everyone as the teacher left the classroom.

"Ok, Mijo this is our opportunity, see ya on the flip side!" said Ikari as she quickly rushed through the barely functioning classroom door and to the computer lab.

"Wait!" shouted Mijo then said to himself; "Hmm, when i went out, the dark world was gone so if she—"

"Hey, Mijo! Come here!" shouted Ikari as she stands near the door looking at him.

"Yeah! Coming!" shouted Mijo back as he also went out of the barely functioning door to Ikari.

"When are we gonna fix that... Anywho, let me guess—" said Mijo.

"The dark world's gone!" said Ikari, with a worried expression.

"That, um, so— like, the dark world's not gone, but we have to do something to make it appear again." said Mijo.

"Really? But, it's closed... It's locked." said Ikari.

"Wha— oh that makes sense. But, we could just break inside?" said Mijo.

"Sure... But how..?" said Ikari.

*Lauvielle joined the conversation*

"Hey guys, I thought we were going to the dark world, what are you guys still here for?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Um, the dark world's gone..." said Mijo.

"WHAT?! How are we supposed to go in then?" said Lauvielle.

"I don't know!! That's why I'm asking him!" said Ikari.

"Hey, I got this, ok? Just, we need to gain access to the room..." said Mijo.

"How..? That's why we're tryna have a discussion, because—" said Ikari.

"—we don't have any way. Yeah. I know." said Mijo as he looks and sees Sir Joriec and his key to the computer lab. "I think we have an opportunity though..." said Mijo.

"Si sir Joriec?!" said Lauvielle, surprised about seeing Sir Joriec.

"Hi, Lauvielle, Cala, nice to meet you again. We're here just to clean up the computer lab." said Sir Joriec as he goes to the computer lab and unlocks it.

"Hey, Mijo, this is our chance... Let's go right now!!" said Ikari to Mijo secretly.

"Hold on, do we include them? Because, you know..." said Mijo back.

"Hey!! What are you guys talking about, i got... distracted..." said Lauvielle, clearly still shocked by the appearance of the teacher.

"Oh, umm, let's go to the dark world now, Mijo! Use your 'magic method', hehe." said Ikari, with  a sarcastic tone.

"Alright, hold on, they should be—" Mijo said, before getting interrupted by a voice nearby.

"Hey! Is sir Joriec there? Mam Sant is asking me to call him..." said Isatac.

"Yeah," said Lauvielle as she looked into the computer lab and said to Sir Joriec, "Hello po, you are being called by Mam Sant..."

"Ay, Sure. I'll go outside right away!" expressed Sir as he went outside and went with the student to go talk to Mam Sant.

"Good, that's our opportunity! Let's go inside then, Mijo, you will create the dark world." said Ikari before she went inside the room.

"Hey! Wait up!" shouted Mijo, as he tried to grab Ikari by the shoulder making her stop by the door. "I don't think creating a dark world with this many people, is a great idea." he continued.

"Oh, now _you_ don't want more people finding out, how are we supposed to invite people then?!" argued Ikari, as she angrily got in.

"Guys, Sir Joriec is coming back here! We need to go there right now. I can talk our way out of this, just make the world already!" said Lauvielle to both of them as she went outside and looked for potential witnesses.

But then suddenly a huge explosion was heard, and a bunch of other smaller ones as well, it was heard around the school.

"What is happening?!" said Ikari, panicking over the supposed destruction going on.

"Uh oh, we need to go in right now! Jomi might need our help!" said Jomi, reassuring Ikari, as he prepared to stab the ground.

"Mijo!! The world's collapsing, again! So many fountains..." shouted Lauvielle from the door as  she looked towards the balcony.

"Alright, let's beat some abyss monsters." said Mijo as he stabbed the ground and recreated the dark world. 

Suddenly, a blinding white light started to blind the three of them and since the door wasn't closed, it connected with the other worlds which were made with connecting them all in mind. Mijo woke up near the place where Jomi usually meets him, but he saw a battlefield instead.

"Ay putakte, there's so many monsters... I thought Jomi got it..." said Mijo as he looked upon the razed grounds of Jomi's Castle.

Then Jomi appeared, knocking back abyss monsters with her signature pink lightning cut, then slashing a big monster through the middle, then quickly dashing to Mijo.

"Hey, you have come at the worst time! The abyss just started a massive attack and I have been trying to suppress them here, what's the situation at the light?" said Jomi as she attacked a bunch of abyss monsters going towards her and Mijo.

"It's bad!! Its super duper bad!!" said Ikari, only just waking up.

"Woah! didn't notice you there. Yeah, I think a bunch of dark worlds also opened..." answered Mijo, shocked at Ikari as he didn't notice her waking up.

"What?! Hold on, really?" said Jomi, shocked at Mijo's answer.

"Yeah, we got here because of that, and uh we were supposed to be here for the—" said Mijo before being interrupted by Jomi. "Yeah, yeah, the intramurals... Let's deal with these monsters first, ok? Also, i thought Lauvielle was supposed to be here..."

"She technically didn't enter, and since the outside was also being filled..." Mijo thinks, then says, "She must be around here, since she wasn't where we were, oh yeah, my entire school probably is here..."

"Oh no, I fear that they have executed their plan very well, we need to stop them." said Jomi, thinking about her investigation earlier.

"Well, then let's goo!! We have to find other people anyway..." said Ikari, worried about her friend's wellbeing.

"I.. have to go stop them, you all look for your lightner friends, me and my army will march straight to their base at the heart of the abyss." said Jomi before she left them to go to the abyss base.

"Whaa— Really? Now how do we do that??" panicked Mijo, as once again, the world is in his hands.

"We're fucked duuude.." said Ikari as she sits down again.

"Now again, we can't give up. Ugh, we can't save everyone, but we can *try* to. Are you following me?" said Mijo, resolute, yet tired.

"Mmmm ok, I.. have nothing to do here anyway, if the world's ending, i _gotta_ enjoy it with my friends..." said Ikari, as she stands up, then says, "Ok, I'm following you now." 

"Alright, we have a deal. Let's go look for Lauvielle, she should be here, on the way, let's kill some monsters, then." said Mijo, then he unsheathed his sword.

"Uh, sure. Lemme just get my gun out." then she pulls out an unknown bolt-action rifle. "Hey, wait why does my weapon always change when I go here, meanwhile that's the same sword I saw back then??" 

"Well, I don't know, I guess you just haven't figured out what you truly want as a weapon.. But that's fine. I'm sure you'll learn quickly, we should go save Lauvielle as soon as possible." reassured Mijo, looking at the gun very intently before looking at Ikari.

"Yeah, hmm let me try it out on these enemies," as she guns down 3 enemies in 3 seconds behind Mijo. "Woah! You're right!"

"Hmmph, they are interrupting this rescue mission, hold on." Mijo then sheathes his sword again then suddenly starts slashing all around the monsters around like a bubble around the field. Then suddenly glass shatters around him as he appears again, with his sword unsheathed again.

"WHAT?! Why do you have that and i have.. this?! Stop, please stop flexing on me already!!" Ikari, surprised about the events that just transpired.

"Eh? I mean, you could try yours, let's see it!" said Mijo, again reassuring her.

"Uh sure," as she focuses, a bunch of monsters appear again, Mijo moves behind Ikari to see what she does then she says, "Guns away!" as she perfectly executes an execution of all the monsters in 5 seconds, decimating all of them.

"That.. was a bit exhilarating, but I.. feel fine, except for the fact that I am a bit tired right now." said Ikari, feeling exhausted but she can still stand up.

"Now, that's what we call a magic burst! Damn you did that first try— I mean second try so that's good!" said Mijo, complimenting Ikari's skills again.

"Second try? Heh, you got defeated that first time so you would definitely remember, haha."
answered Ikari, as she sits down on the ground.

"Guys! Over there! Some survivors!" a voice rang out from the left of them, they seem to be lightners as well, likely about the same grade level as them.

"Huh?! Sino kayo?!" questioned Mijo, as he was surprised about the lightners.

"Ah! I— It's you!" said the person in front of them as they called into their group, "Urda!"

"Huh, Urda..?" said Mijo as he looks into the group as a figure is going to the front

"Yep! It's me!" shouted Urda excitedly as everybody lowered their guard.

"Hey~ Its been a long time, speaking like this... I wish it wasn't these days that we do..." said Mijo.

"Yeah, I agree. Honestly, I have been getting to know my section a lot and... it was thanks to you that i got here in the first place.." replied Urda.

"Ah don't worry about it, anywho... We still need to find out what's happening and how to stop this whole mess, I figured you know something about this?" said Mijo, getting back to the point of their meeting.

"I mean... last chance to talk before apocalypse is nice... But yeah, I am wondering where's your section cause' as soon as the sky was turning dark and an explosion happened, I immediately rushed and gathered all of 'em before getting fully dropped in.." said Urda, with a bit of questions for Mijo as well.

"I.. wasn't prepared for that—"

"No shit sherlock, yeah, how do you have a plan for this?! I mean, a catastrophe like this has never happened before, right?!" said Ikari, cutting off Mijo and being a bit loud at the same time.

"Well, actually—"

"Are you about to tell me that you have gone through _this_ before and haven't had a backup plan?" questioned Ikari.

"Alright, calm down. Yeah— Mine was an on the field decision either... So, it isn't his fault, since we did win last time, but— well looks like we have to go searching for the answers again..." explained Urda.

"By the way, have your friends have been fighting the abyss monsters the entire time?" questioned Mijo as he saw the background of a mix of people battling some abyss monsters.

"Uh yeah, why did you think I had the time to talk to you two? Well we better go, we might find some clues along the way so.. lets go!" said Urda as she helps Ikari get up.

"Oh well, I wonder what's happening with Jomi..." said Mijo as all of them walked over to the group.

*To the Depths of the Abyss*

"Show yourself, before I go ahead and find you instead!" taunted Jomi as she goes with her army around the abyss base.

"Well well, It has been a long time, Dark Princess..." said a figure in the dark.

"Wait, I know you! You're the _Abyss Doctor!_ You only hid in the abyss instead of being defeated..." said Jomi as she realizes who she's dealing with.

"Hehe.. Smart as ever, hmm? Ah well, I'm afraid this is just a test, an experiment to see a possibility, now—" 

Jomi tried to surprise the _Abyss Doctor_ with her lightning slash but he was protected by a shield and so she was knocked back.

"You think I wouldn't have a shield on? Or you just don't want to know what you came here for... answers..?" said the _Abyss Doctor_, in a mocking tone.

"Alright, fine. I am here for answers, but that doesn't mean you can hide there forever!" shouted Jomi but still negotiating with the abyss.

"Oh yes certainly, you only cut off the most important piece.. my data is complete. But, judging by you.. I think you know when we'll meet again... Goodbye, and have at 'em!" said the _Abyss Doctor_ in a sassy and mocking tone before leaving, as a horde of monsters spawn from everywhere, the floors, his former place, everything in the room.

"Men! Fall back! We can't risk dying here without good gains..." ordered Jomi as she and her army retreated from the abyss.

*To the Darkness*

"So what did you get in the AP quiz? I messed up... quite badly in some of the questions..." said Mijo.

"Wait, no— was it because of the graph? You told me that earlier!" said Ikari.

"Damn, I feel bad for you.. I mess up sometimes, it just happens haha.." responded Urda.

After chatting for a bit they saw a human figure, throwing out bombs and stabbing anyone that came close to them, she looked like a witch in form.

"Uh hey! Who are you?" called Ikari to the unknown person.

"Woah— Ah! It's only you... You scared me there Ikari..." said Lauvielle as she stopped due to them arriving.

"Hey, might wanna—"

Mijo got cut off before Urda ran near Lauvielle then killed the abyss monsters for her.

"—kill those guys first..." 

"Ugh, Mijo, stop yapping and start attacking!" said Ikari before also joining in on the action.

"Ok, Fine!" said Mijo as he also joins in.

Afterwards, the amount of abyss monsters dwindled then they stopped after the last one died.

"Gu— Guys..." said Ikari as she is breathing very heavily.

"What..?" questioned Mijo as he also breathes heavily.

"Let's... lie down.." said Urda as she faceplants on the floor. Everyone lays down on the floor.

"I.. think you guys exhausted yourselves a bit much.." said Lauvielle, concerned about her friends.

"Yeah.. Its fine... We got you, Lauvielle." said Urda, picking herself back up.

"I have never done _this_ much fighting in a while..." said Ikari, breathing heavily and laying on the floor as others were sitting instead.

"Anyways, it seems that there are barely any monsters left..." said Mijo, looking around the group.

"Urda! Urda! Someone is calling you, their name was like Jomi or something..." called out Reeb, as she was running towards them.

"Oh! Jomi has returned and is probably looking for us, come everyone." said Mijo, getting up on his feet.

"Yeah, we're going.." said Urda as she does the same.

So slowly, they all got up and started walking back to where the Oxir group was along with Jomi and some of her army. They arrive and this is the conversation that followed:

"Oh finally, you arrive. Anywho, I need a huge favor and.. I need to speak with Mijo. Privately."
said Jomi, resolute yet shaken by the events earlier.

"Ah sure! Guys wait here, and uh go with Urda, Ikari." said Mijo to his group.

"Ok... Let's go Ikari." said Urda, secretly having some questions about the whole thing.

"Uh, sure..?" said Ikari too, questioning the private conversation secretly.

"Let's go guys! Let's give them space, anyways, what was..." said Lauvielle as Mijo walks with Jomi to a place without a lot of people, near the castle.

"Ok, so here's the thing, I don't want to have them worry and... I don't think I can hide anything from you, so let me just tell you this right now..." explained Jomi, so tired and yet still wants to talk.

"Hmm ok. I understand. Ok, I won't reveal anything unless you tell me to." assured Mijo, curious about what Jomi is about to say.

"Ok, so... no sugarcoating, the _Abyss Doctor_ is back." said Jomi, straight to the point.

"What?! Now?! Uh... Do you know what he is doing back?" questioned Mijo, remembering past events.

"He seems to be preparing for something, a plan of his i don't like. He said that his data collecting is done..." said Jomi, summarizing what the doctor has said.

"Oh no, do you know when he is coming back? Because he is definitely coming back for something.." questioned Mijo, as he began formulating plans in his mind.

"Hmm, he didn't tell me. But I know it already. It's the day of your year end party." answered Jomi, also thinking about plans.

"What?! That's like 3 days from now, why did he suddenly appear now, instead of later in the week??" said Mijo, worrying about the intramurals.

"I don't know. But I have to keep the patrol and scouts up if he comes back. You should be wary of him when you plan your intramurals." said Jomi, as she makes a smile that only tired people make.

"Ah, that. Well I guess I should have a plan tomorrow, no ambitious stuff though, we got delayed by the abyss..." said Mijo, already thinking of some board games that can work.

"Ok. Let's head back. We should close the dark worlds by this point." said Jomi, as both of them started walking back to the group.

"Hmm, I wonder why this hasn't affected the whole 'worlds colliding if too much darkness' stuff that you were saying about..." questioned Mijo as they walked.

"Well, after the cataclysmic event that happened during grade 8, i made _sure_ to make it so that isn't a problem. I used _some_ abyss powers to do that however, which I can't say I regret doing, but I could have done better purifying..." said Jomi, as they finally finished and met with the others.

"Hii! Your back!!! Finally, we were about to go to you, because we were getting bored here.." said Lauvielle, getting bored standing around and talking.

"Yeah, let's just close the other dark worlds, then we can go home..." said Mijo, exhausted but determined to see it through.

Then JR and Rhida arrive at Jomi's Castle with a bunch of remaining grade 9 alive.

"Hey, so this is the last one, right Rhida?" said JR, counting the fountains written on his paper.

"Yep! and this looks like the most important one." said Rhida, looking at the castle and the fountain beside it.

"Hey! What's up!! JR and.. Rhida!" said Mijo with a smile, noticeably at JR.

"Hey. We are done here, and this is the last one, so. let's close this one?" answered JR back.

"Yeah, sure. This was all unexpected anyway. See you, soon?" said MIjo, now turning to Rhida.

"Uh, yeah... C- Can you do it, Mijo?" questioned Rhida, surprised about Mijo looking at her but still managed to blurt out something.

"Y- yeah.. Hold on." answered Mijo, surprised about Rhida too.

Then Mijo went and closed the fountain by offering his heart, then light covered all of their eyes and then, they were back in Honrato. Mijo was laying down on the floor of the computer lab.

"Ugh, man, I hate these types of transitions... Anyway..." said Mijo, as he got up and surveyed the room to find Ikari getting up and Lauvielle near the door, also getting up.

"What, does this happen every time? Man..." responded Ikari, looking around her.

"Yeah, well... when there's no reasonable way for us to have fallen asleep... At least according to our research." said Lauvielle, also looking around.

"We should go out, it is almost night, and we should go home." said Mijo, as he looked outside to see a blue sky almost getting dark.

"Oh... It's 5:30 PM.." said Ikari, as she looked at her phone. "Well— I better go, this meeting has gone longer than I wanted, so imma go— byeeee!"

"Bye, Ikari!" said Lauvielle and Mijo as she went out of the room.

"Uh, how about you? I still have to wait a couple of minutes..." questioned Mijo to Lauvielle, as he started writing down something.

"Hmm, right now! I bet all of my compadres in the service are ready to go, so.. I'm going too, stay safe!" answered Lauvielle before she also went out of the room.

"Ok, I should go as well, hmm," said Mijo as he looked for the lock... "Ah! There it is. Now let's just—" said Mijo as he goes out of the room then says, "—lock it. Ok then, i am getting out of here." as he locks the room.

"Hey... Mijo." said Rhida as she looked nervous and worried about something.

"Oh, uh— Hi! there..." said Mijo back, as he was surprised, then he started to feel nervous too.

"Let's keep this convo short and secret. Do you... still have feelings for me?" questioned Rhida as she looked down.

"Huh? Well, in truth, i don't know myself. I had this on and off thing with you and I don't know how to express it... I feel like whenever I get close to you, I mess it up, someway... How.. about you?" answered Mijo, as he cried a bit and kept looking at her.

Long silence, then he heard cries from her, as she said, "I.. didn't know you felt that way. I thought that I only had this thing for you and you didn't reciprocate... and I was fine with that. But now... I see. Um.. Well— you probably know that I have started seeing other people right?" also answered Rhida, with a question too.

"Hmm, i had suspicions, but since I thought that you moved on and I respected that, I just put it on the back of my mind. I have another question, do you think I have been seeing other people as well?" said Mijo to Rhida, now looking at her eyes.

"Y— Yeah... At first, it was Urda, then when the next grade came along, it was Ikari.. Is it all true? I still have no 'boyfriend' by the way, if that's what you were wondering..." said Rhida back, now staring back at Mijo.

"Well, I have suspicions, but I think both are truly just my friends, one is an unconfirmed asexual and one is a confirmed lesbian, so I don't know really... As for me, I also think of them as friends. Truly." said Mijo, now posing like he's thinking pretty hard.

"That's.. fine! Ok, this convo is over, as my parents are waiting for me... Bye! Uh, see you soon!" said Rhida, saying goodbye to Mijo and going downstairs to go home.

"You too!" said Mijo, bidding farewell too,he also went down, making sure to not look like they are together.

As he went home, he thought to himself, what caused this sudden conversation with Rhida and how this would change the dynamics between them. But as he got home and changed to house wear, he decided to focus on the intramural plan he was working on, tomorrow will be a blast.

He woke up the next day, feeling tired but as soon as he looked at the date, he exclaimed; "It's Intramurals Season!", so off he went to get ready and after that, go to school.

Soon after arriving, he quickly ran to his room to set up the stuff but he opened the classroom door to see darkness...

"Oh, damn. Well that makes sense, I am kinda late, and I doubt they waited for me... But who opened it?" said Mijo to himself before he jumped down into the darkness, seeing him transform to his usual dark self then after landing, seeing the huge castle ahead of him.

He went to the castle and to the Great Hall in which he found 9-Lit chilling in the Dining Area and Jomi and Ikari, speaking to each other.

"So this is how you open it? Coool!" exclaimed Ikari, reading a book.

"Yeah, be careful though, we don't want to break the balance ok?" said Jomi, looking at Ikari.

"Hey guys! So, who opened this one?" greeted Mijo, looking at Jomi.

"Oh, uh it was... Urda? She said to 'not worry' and that she 'got it' So i let her go into the room and when i looked at her, she already stabbed the ground and the dark world was opening... then i met her." said Ikari, pointing to Jomi.

"Ah nice... Any new games there, or do I have to bring mine?" said Mijo, as he checked his bag for his games again.

"Ah! Now for that, I have an answer, your games are already in!" exclaimed Jomi excitedly, grinning to Mijo.

"Whe— Oh.. well i am going to check inside the dining area, see ya!" said Mijo, before he took off.

After he went in, he saw his creations, such as the _'Mijo's Monster Battle V.2.4'_, the _'Dance of CHAOS V1.6'_, the _'Extreme Ball Drive V.1.1'_ and the _'Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4'_. He also saw Jomi's creations such as the _'Test of Resolute Will V3.0'_, the _'Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta'_ and the _'Jomi's Magical Sports V1.0'_

"Damn, she really did? Ok, hmm, oh hey! The dining wall board! It looks like the advertisements for the games are here... Let me see..." said Mijo, as he looked and found the advertisement poster of Jomi.

    ## Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4
    A game where you shoot enemies far away by using an AWP-styled gun to score points, with limited ammo and time. There's two game modes, level and endless. Endless is self-explanatory, you get given a map where you constantly reposition and shoot enemies before the timer runs out, and there's escort and normal. Escort is where you kill enemies because there's a transport you have to protect from damage. Level is two parts, escort and normal. This time enemies are limited but there is still a timer.

Next is the Daily Domains (Daily Battles(, in which, everyday, a rotation of domains are set and you can go battle them to get day-specific rewards. Lastly is the 'Memories of Adventures' in which you go through levels made by Jomi and others that recreate their adventures such as the _Abyss Doctor_ fight, the Shley fight, and the all-favorite Jomi fight.

"Oh wow, she put the details of my games too? She's gotta be one of those fast learners I suppose, hmm, although there's barely a tutorial.. Whatever, I am sure it's accurate, I've checked already!" said Mijo to himself as he looks around and checks out the games.

"Hey there Mijo..." said JR, surprising Mijo as he looked at the games.

"Oh! JR! Hi there, so uh what game you wanna play, i wanna do the TRW thing, it's basically shingen impact!" said Mijo, who's now looking at JR.

"Ok. Hmmm, what mode and what weapons?" said JR as he walks with Mijo to where the game is.

"I want my normal swordsman and electro type.  How about you? Default as well?" said Mijo, who kept walking to the game with JR.

"Yep, mage and electro. Shouldn't we get someone else to get good elemental reactions?" said JR, now at the game selecting difficulty and mode.

"Yeah, i know the two, Jomi and Ikari." said Mijo, now done at the selection screen and is now waiting for other players.

"Ok, I'll stay here and wait for you, go get them!" said JR, now swiping to the enemies screen.

"Ok." said Mijo before quickly going to where Jomi and Ikari were.

"Here's how to beat it, trust me, you can do it. I have tested the games and they're quite fun and challenging!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari reading the tutorial of TRW level 10.

"Bro it is literally impossible, I mean that Shley is pretty dangerous and it's too OP! I don't even have a shield user unlike your fight!" argued Ikari as she looked mad at Jomi.

"Hey guys! Wanna play some TRW? Trust me, i have JR with me so it's gonna be a blast." said Mijo as he looked at both of them about to explode.

"Sure! I would love to, I have a lot of testing to do anyway, like Ikari here saying that the Shley 1v1 is too hard." said Jomi, looking at Mijo.

"Wha— Are you trying to imply something? Anyway, yeah. As long as I don't have to do those fights by myself with Jomi watching from the sidelines..." said Ikari, now calming down and looking at Mijo.

"Hey! I was making sure that I recognie the errors in my code, ok?" said Jomi, now looking at the ground.

"Good, now uh I guess you can all make up and don't have to almost kill each other..." said Mijo as the three of them shared a small awkward laugh and after, move to JR's position.

"Hmm, this is easy, this one, I have been there... and this one, looks challenging.. Oh hey guys!" said JR as he looked at the enemies at the level enemies screen.

"Hey! JR! So let's start the game now?" said Ikari as she very quickly got to the screen and started picking her character.

"Hmm, I'll pick my normal fire and sword type, how about you, Ikari?" said Jomi as she picked her character.

"I'll go with this heart thingy, looks like my element color which is green." said Ikari as she picked her character.

"Oh that's dendro, nice! Hmm your dendro gun and our reactions will make this easy... Quick, JR start it since you're the first one to put your character in!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari then to JR.

"Uh thanks?" thanked Ikari, confused to what Jomi said.

"Yep, I agree. Anyways lets start the game." said JR as he pressed play and all of them get transported to a familiar domain to the two of them.

"Woah, coool— this is what you've been working on, I was wondering..." said Mijo as they went towards a red key in the middle of the arena.

"Yeah, yeah.. All of you are familiar with this so let's start it." said Jomi as she touched the key and suddenly a bunch of enemies started appearing.

"Ok. *Let's dance!!* " said Mijo as they charged head-on towards the monsters.

Author's Note: DONE! Let's gooo! WE HAVE FINISHED a special chapter since this one even though not even complete has a lot of lore stuff that I will take in mind when writing the first ones. This is so cool! I was planning to do a students night chapter but I might continue Chapter 3, anyway, stay tuned here if I ever make that chapter. Also, I get it, some of these are 'inspirations' but you'll see how I improved upon it. Anyway.. Peace out, and see you!

<!--Chapter 4 draft, subject to change due to likely revision of earlier plot points-->
<p id="C4"><md-block># C4 DeltaRambles: The Student's Night</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Author's Note: 
Edit 1: So.. I have combined two drafts of c4 into one so hopefully that works out. That means that currently, we are going with thia draft, but trust me, you'll see the fruits of this soon.

Oh, so originally this was a spinoff, but I realized it would be better as a chapter, so it is now! Though, the lore... Oh well, you'll see what I wrote soon enough.

The food fest is an excuse to refine some of Mijo's parts that I want to pay off in S1, and also, since this is a spinoff, I don't have to think much, which is great, since I don't have a lot of time to think too, hehe..
 Anyways, enjoy!

Summary: Mijo is suddenly surprised when there's an event in both worlds, one week full of fun as the quarter wraps up, a students night along with a food fest. Unfortunately for our lightners, the abyss has other plans than let the lightners enjoy the week...

On a random school day, as Mijo is practicing his fighting, using a variety of weapons: 

His main sword, his katana; for quick slashes and quick parries more on deflecting, it can summon slashes and is the best sword when he is in the air, as he can summon slashes and when he goes down, knocking back enemies using the force from his sword. He also uses this as his main ultimate as he uses it to dash through reality to cut through the veil of time and space. 

His odachi, for slower and stronger slashes, used for piercing and more aggressive plays. It usually involves more aggressive parries that you initiate and win, or you battle and win. He also uses it to pierce enemies and is better against shielded enemies. His ultimate here, involves slowing time to hit more precise slashes to decimate enemies.

He also wielded other weapons that he returned to the owner, before replicating it on his training ground, such as scythe from Sasha, and snake sword from JR.

"Every single day I become more like Dante... Well.. Eh, nothing could be done about it. I like my katana, but so many weapon variety to have fun with is fun too sometimes.. But my greatest would of course, always be my katana.." said Mijo to himself, as he practiced and practiced on a group of enemies.

"Hey there.. You bored yet, Mijo?" said Jomi, as she comes into his training ground.

"Maybe? Why..? Anything interesting happening outside here?" said Mijo, as he slashes through a training monster.

"Yeah, a lot actually. That's why Urda isn't here, or even Rhida, they're both buying.. i don't know, but they seem to be enjoying the event in town." said Jomi, as Mijo looks at her.

"Oh, ok. What's the event then? Combat related?  Hopefully, but I don't mind if it's not.. i guess." said Mijo, as he stopped the fight and looked at Jomi in anticipation.

"Well, it's not combat—" "Awwww", interrupted Mijo as Jomi continued, "—But! It has food! Good food! All affordable, trust me."

"Uh, sure.. I don't have anything else to do anyway, especially during these times. Well, let's go. You coming with?" said Mijo, as Jomi said, "Well, that's why I am here... Let's go!"

As they head off to the fountain, Mijo is thinking about something.

"Hey, wait a minute.. We're going to the light world? Aren't you a darkner?", said Mijo, as Jomi nodded, but responded, "Well, yeah. You'll see." 

"Wait.. You'll.. But why... Ok. Fine." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"He then looks to the school, from the second floor railings, until he realizes something.

"Gosh, it's been a year! We probably should celebrate one year of the dark world. But.. I need to.. organize first. Which.. I don't want to do. Too tiring." said Mijo to himself, as Ikari notices him again, staring off into the distance.

"Hey! So..! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you still be training in the dark world?" questioned Ikari, as Mijo looks at her.

"Uh.." Mijo looked at the gym and saw no notable event happening, then he continued, "Hey, uh is there like a food fest or anything gonna happen in the gym?" questioned Mijo, as Ikari thought for one second, then said, "Nah.. In fact, I was just about to go to the dark world.. Soo... Can you accompany me there?" 

"What? Really..?! You.. are a grown woman, well.. somewhat. You can go there by yourself! Don't worry, Jomi is there if you need anything, and.. I think Lauvielle's there, not sure." said Mijo, as Ikari reiterated, "Ehh, come on, it's just when going in, I trust you're busy, so no more than that! Ok?"

Mijo looks at the gym, again. Then looks at Ikari and says, "Suure.. You know what, let's go to Jomi's town. I wanna see what Jomi was talking about some food fest stuff.", Ikari smiled then she said, "Yeah! Then we can check out what Jomi is cooking! Her cooking is fire!!"

Then they go to the dark world, where they fall to where they see Jomi going out of her castle and looking at them.

"Hey! I just came back from some.. important stuff and I was about to go here to wait for Mijo, then you lot dropped in!" exclaimed Jomi, as the two notice her and are happy.

"Hey!!! Jomi!!!" said Ikari, as they both hugged as Mijo smiled and said, "Ikari, you just missed 1 week, you miss her that much? Oh, and.. thank you, Jomi."

"What?!; Can't hug a friend?!" responded Ikari, as Jomi smiled and said, "Y— Yeah. Sure. Um, let's go!" said Jomi, as they stopped hugging and started to go to the actual town.

"Soo.. uh.. what do you do here, anyway? I've never actually questioned what you and Jomi do in the dark world, except for what you always tell me, Um.... 'training' is what you always say.", Mijo thinks about what to say, but Jomi responds for him, "He.. says training but he's usually there to reflect and fighting is therapeutic for him, as for me, I manage the town here, and I research new magic stuff sometimes."

"Woah! That sounds cool! Can you make a custom gun? Cause' this one—", Ikari brings her gun out, "—is kinda.. boring? Look, I've *never* fought a lot but, this one.. It's like— it isn't the best! So.. can you make me one, please? I'll even give you... ummm.. what do mayors want..?", Jomi smiled and looked at Mijo, as Mijo nodded at Jomi, and said, "Well, you should ask her? But, since I have known her since.. well, for a year or so, I know that.. she would like a pendant."

Ikari turned to Jomi and said, "Is this true? This guy—", she pointed to Mijo, then turned back to Jomi, "He's smart.. But he can often misremember things.. So, since he just said, 'ask you', I am asking you, so what ya want?", Jomi laughed and responded, "Well, this is one he remembers.. A pendant with.. a flower! Oh heck, even a witch hat, just having pendants to wear looks nice!"

"Noted. Anyways, you got something to say, Mijo?", as Ikari noticed Mijo about to say something before closing his mouth. "Uh, nothing. Just.. thinking about something.", said Mijo, as Jomi speaks up, "Yeah.. don't bother. If he wants to say something. He will probably have already said it."

"True. But.. it's still worth trying. Anyways, I am sure it's nothing. Let's continue!" said Ikari, as Mijo and Jomi smiled, as Jomi notices. "Yeah, I agree. Let's make this last.", said Jomi, as they continue heading to the town.

They go into Jomi's Town, and see Urda at first, checking out some new games that were included with the food fest, such as the old classics, Test of Resolute Will and Mijo's Monster Battle and the all-new Trailblazer's Traveling Bus, formerly known as Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta.

"So.. As you can see, Mijo, I have been working with Rhida, JR and Urda to update these games, and it's been fun!" said Jomi, as they walked to Urda, before she heard them and said, "Yeah, I didn't have much input on the game though, my job was visuals and sound effects, which.. look for yourself!", then she pointed them to the new game.

"Woah... This is.. interesting. At the same time as the light counterpart too.." said Mijo, before Ikari commented, "Hmm, I wonder, does anyone even play 'games' here when we have magic?"

"Well, as you can see... It's still appealing! Since, however you change it, danger, risk and potential harm is still at play when it comes to these parts, so these games exist! It has also been.. a long passion of ours to make an actual game people enjoy.." said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Mhmm.. Well, you wanna join us, Urda?" questioned Mijo to Urda, as she thinks for a second then says, "Another time, dude."

"I understand, let's go, Ikari." said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other and headed deeper into the streets of the town, where Rhida's group can be found eating near a huge food stall.

"Hi! Rhida!!" said Jomi, as they both hugged each other, and Rhida said, "It's been a while, Jomi! Like, actually.. Ever since we finished wor last week, I have never seen you! Even in your castle! At least, when I went there.."

"I am *sooo* sorry, Rhida..! Like, I was busy these past few days, I couldn't even talk to Mijo! Oh, um... yeah! Here's Mijo, and that's Ikari...!" said Jomi, as they look at the two, with the others, like Mack, who was smiling and Rhida, who was pretty awkward seeing Mijo, but she still had a smile, but it was obvious as to what she was currently feeling.

"Hi, Rhida. Long time no see too! We haven't, well at least not... well, um.. talked, since the last world ending disaster..." said Mijo, as Ikari commented, "Jeez, you two have so much tension...", forgetting that everyone heard her.

"Haha— Wh— What do you mean— Ikari? It's nothing! Just.. mmm..." said Mijo, before Jomi got them out of the awkward situation by saying, "Yeah, but.. you know how it is.. No one's willing to say anything, so why bother?"

"Yeah! Why bother.. *ahem* Let's change the topic! Something a bit more light hearted! Like, like.." said Rhida, as she struggled to come up with words to say, until Fexili said, "How about the good food! I just _loove_ the churros around here, it's great!"

"Oh yeah! That, and the fruit drinks, especially the one that sparkles!!! Oooh just thinking about it, hey! Let's go there!" said Rhida, as Mijo said, "I would, but we won't be following just yet. See you around, Rhida."

"Oh, um.. Ok.. Guys, let's go!" said Rhida as Rhida's group headed off to some other stall, as Mijo's group explored the area, finding more stalls and more food, until it was time to head home.

"Wow! I did not expect that burger, the cheese, and the meat! I mean, it's a homemade burger, but it still tastes amazing..!" said Mijo, as Ikari laughs and nods, agreeing with his statement.

"Awww.. It looks like it's time to head home.. It's 17:00, Mijo.." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked and Ikari's a bit confused but then after a while gets it.

"Ohhh! Shit, it's 5! I better go back now, see you two tomorrow, bye!!!" said Ikari, before running, to go back to the light and towards home. "Haha.. Well, you still got an hour, what do *you* wanna do?" said Jomi, as Mijo looks at Ikari slowly disappears out of view.

"Ughh... I guess it's time to say something about.. what exactly were you busy for those days, hmm?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi has a big exasperated sigh, knowing it was inevitable. "Just.. the usual... Abyssal problems, as always. It's not going out of control, yet. But.. I suspect that.. we aren't out of the danger yet."

"What?! I thought the *Abyss Doctor's* threats were null when he didn't show up at the year end party?!" said Mijo, as he looked increasingly more worried, but Jomi has more to say, "Yeah, and that is because of me. Sorry. _He_ is always vague so I can't exactly predict him, and.. you understand me right?! I was exhausted and was already swirling with hundreds of information, there's a mistake that happened there..."

 "I.. never confronted you directly, since I was just thankful that there weren't any abyss monsters, but how can I trust you, if you can make mistakes as important as this, how can I know if I should be scared?!" said Mijo, as Jomi stares off, not looking at Mijo, feeling guilty and pressured. "I.. can't say anything else, other than sorry, I'll be better. But, you have to trust me on this one, ok, this time it will also be just you, so if anything happens it's between *you* and *me.* Got it...?"

"Ok, got it... It was just a week ago, when the world was in darkness, again..." said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. Jomi added, "Yeah, and you know what's the worst part, _he_ knew exactly where I was at during that time, tired and exhausted, it's probably what he wanted me to be when meeting him..."

"I see.. So, you have any non half asleep thoughts on when *he* is coming back?" questioed Mijo, as Jomi laughed and said, "Ah.. That is exactly why I didn't initiate, I have no answer. Let's meet back up tomorrow, during the student's night." 

"Ah! And— and, where exactly? I can't just show up in full suit and tie and go into the dark world, you know how these things play out..!" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed again and said, "Well, let's just say.. I made a little spell that makes this easier...", then Jomi casts something that affects Mijo's mind, Mijo feels this.

"Ugh.. You can do this?!" said Mijo, as Jomi turns to her serious face and says, "Of course. We are connected, and this magic is only powerful since we are so related.", then she smiles, "That means this is special for us!"

"I... trust you, but what will you do with this? Does it affect the mind..?" said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and said, "It allows me to exist in your mind, simple."

"WHAT?!" said Mijo, as he checks the time, and realized it's time for him to go. "Ok, ok.. Mhmm... I'll see you I guess.", as he left the dark world.

He went home, and he and his mother prepared for the student's night tomorrow.

"Alright, so me and your sis agreed on this, it's reusing your year end party clothes, but with a bit more specialty in the night. Look here." said May, his mother, as he looks and sees, blue polo, with long sleeves, a black coat, long dark blue pants, and a grey tie.

"Oh nice. Well, it looks good to me." said Mijo, before May looks at him, she laughs a bit. "Everything looks good to you, nak, even the pajamas."

"Haha.. That's just how I roll. Anyways Imma go to my computer, it seems everything's prepared.." said Mijo, before May nods, indicating acknowledgement.

As he goes to his computer, in his room, he sees Jomi, dressed in a black gown, with her hair stylized longer, going over her shoulders, and she has no glasses, she is sitting on the small sofa in his room.

"Hi there!" greeted Jomi, as Mijo is surprised by this and says, "H— huh?! Oh— it's you. So.. um, how are you here, again?"

"Oh nothing much, just in my empty room connecting to you using magic, hey, I picked out _my_ best clothes! Uh, where are we... anyway?" explained Jomi, as she looks around the room. "This is my room in the light world, as you can see, it looks eerily similar to the dark one.", said Mijo, as he showed Jomi around, holding her hand.

"Oh wow, this house... Mmm.. Well, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo sits on his revolving chair, "Programming, my light hobby. I write the scripts here for the dark games as well as my journey in the dark world, hey, it's genuinely a good fantasy story for other people, I just changed the names around for the lightners, like here!"

"Mmm? The characters... Oh, Joshua and.. Darice? The first sounds like you got a name that started with J that fits you, the second looks like a name that was made from switching letters around..." said Jomi, as she looked at the character list.

"Yeah! I know right, creative naming on my part, but.. are you not going to tell me what the *abyss doctor* is doing?" said Mijo, as Jomi pulled away from him and said, "Mmm.. Like I said, tomorrow. I just tested the system to see if it is working."

"I see. Well.. Oooh! Wait I have a question! How do other people see me, like when I hold you?" said Mijo, as Jomi sits down and says, "Haha... Well, it's like when you interact with me, like let's say you try to float by stepping on me, you think you are.. But the moment that someone sees where I am supposed to be, you fall." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked by this, "I see, so I'm basically delusional. What if I don't notice the person, what happens?"

"Well, it's obvious. You're just moving normally, like if you're floating, you're just on the ground. The sensation of falling only happens to you, you just return to your senses." explained Jomi, as Mijo processes what Jomi said, and says, "Aight, cool. That's all I have to say, you can get out of my head now."

"Sure. I only have one more thing to say, what I am doing is best in the light world, as this type is hard in the dark world since your magic can unintentionally prevent my projection, which already is causing a lot of my energy." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and looked at his computer, "Aight, that's good to know, but.. now that I know it's possible...", before Mijo looks concerned thinking about the multiple ways of using it.

"Everything's possible, Mijo. Anyways, Imma go, see you!" said Jomi, as she left Mijo's mind, letting him procrastinate on school work alone. 

*Alarm starts, it's loud, and it's singing "When I look in the mirror, can't believe what I see—"*

He turned off the alarm, and woke up the next day, tired but excited as today was the anticipated student's night, so he excitedly did his morning routine and headed off to school, as there was still the morning and afternoon preparations to do.

"Alright, few things to do, I guess. Well, Jomi, follow me if you want." said Mijo to himself in the mirror as he went and did his morning routine. Then as he got his clothes, his mom called him, "Hey! Your night clothes are on the right and the day clothes are on the left!", Mijo responded, "Got it!", as he started dressing using the day clothes.

He went to school, dressed up like a 'writer' from the 1890s because that's what the clothes insinuated from his style of choice. Then he went to the dark world to visit Jomi, before the event. His wear in the dark world is a bit different, changing to a more dark blue and dark yellow coloring on his coat and jacket, respectively.

"Huh, she isn't here.. Weird, she always met me here.. Maybe busy? But.. she said... hmm.." said Mijo, as he looked around, he decided to head inside Jomi's castle, but as he went closer, some of Jomi's guards noticed him and approached him.

"Sir Mijo, unfortunately, your Majesty has gone out on an expedition into the abyss for 'important business'. This is what the princess told me." said the guard, before Mijo looked shocked and worried.

"I.. see. Have you come across any lightners other than me?" questioned Mijo, as the other guard shook his head, indicating that he was the first one.

"Huh..? That's weird. Well, I suppose I'll go inside, then." said Mijo, before the guard stopped him and said, "Sorry, the princess has also ordered us to stop anyone from going inside the castle, including you, sir."

"Weird.. Alright, guess I'll have to see her another time. Bye!" said Mijo, as he waved goodbye to the guards before going back to the light world, seeing Urda and Lauvielle talking.

"Are you sure, he's gonna dance with you?" questioned Urda, before Lauvielle answered, "Nah, I don't have faith in him now, especially considering before."

"Hey gals! Um, you uh seen the dark world?" questioned Mijo, as he sees the clothes of the two, both having casual attire. "No, actually, we were just about to jump in after talking, what? Another problem?" responded Urda, having mixed feelings about the question.

"Yeah... Jomi is apparently not allowing anyone to her castle and the town, she's on some.. quest."

————————————————————————————

Mijo goes to school, moving up once again. He goes to school with a more determined and persevering attitude as he faces another randomized section, with people he doesn't know, however some friends remained, specifically Ikari and Lauvielle. With the huge loss of JR, he has to try again to survive school, hopefully take care of the huge plan of the abyss doctor, if he ever reveals himself.

"Ugh.. it's another day.. Tuesday." muttered Mijo to himself as he looked over the balcony, during his lunch time. "I wonder.. is anyone going to open the dark world again?" muttered Mijo as his thoughts wander to the dark world. "Well, we'll just wait and see. I see no reason to dwell on this. Hopefully, if anyone does so.. it better be tomorrow." muttered Mijo, before he left to go recollect his thoughts and walked around the school.

The next day, at a break right around before the last period, Mijo is seen walking around the construction of a new building, the one that was demolished and is now being rebuilt with a second floor.

"A lot has changed.. ever since.. that night. I don't know how to feel about it. So far, I haven't had any.. major stress, for now." said Mijo, before he checked the time. "Oh, I should go back. After MAPEH, it should be.. ugh. CAT." continued Mijo, as he walked to his classroom.

He took in the view of the school one more time, before he went up the stairs and towards his classroom on the second floor. "Oh boy, I wonder.. what's sir going to teach us..?" muttered Mijo, before he opened the door in his classroom, but it was dark. "Uhuh.. another dark world? Who opened this one?" said Mijo, as he stepped back from shock a bit. "Well, my time.. has come. Let's jump in." said Mijo, before he jumped in, landing at an unknown ruined building with his sword sheathed.

"Oh, I am here." said Mijo, as he looked around the destroyed landscape, reminiscent of old worlds. "Huh, ok..." remarked Mijo, before two unknown darkners showed up with their blades. "Quién es? Ah, hmm..." said one of the darkners, checking Mijo out. "Hah? You speak spanish?" questioned Mijo as both of them answered, "Si."

"Um, so you understand English.. so bilingual?" asked Mijo, before the other darkner responded, "Tatlong wika po, Mijo." as Mijo raised his eyebrows and responded, "Wow.. you know my name? Whew... Hmm, tell me. You know where.. the fountain is?" the two men looked at each other before one of them said, "Si, pero primero, permítanos presentarle a nuestro líder." 

"Uh.. first, permit us to.. present our leader? Oh, sure. Vamos, entonces." said Mijo, translating then moving with the darkners to a makeshift building. "Señorito Mijo, nuestro líder está aquí. Nosotros esperaremos afuera." said the darkner as Mijo enters waving goodbye. "Hii!! Who are.. you.." said Mijo, as he realizes he's looking at a Jomi. "Hmph, Mijo? Let's cut the spanish here, or Filipino. Who exactly are you, Mijo from the prophecy?" said Jomi, as Mijo was completely stunned. "Don't you.. no no.. no.. I.. knew you before this. I am a lightner, been with you since a year ago.." responded Mijo with a hint of worry, as Jomi became concerned. "Huh? This is the first time, lightner. Your first descent into this world." responded Jomi with a hint of worry.

"**This** world, yes. But.. not the dark worlds!" exclaimed Mijo, as Jomi took a closer look at Mijo. "Hmm, I see.. Then, this must mean.." said Jomi, as she got a book from behind her and swiped through it until she found a page she was keeping bookmarked. "There are other versions of me.. other dark worlds.." said Jomi, as she slumped on her chair, looking more exhausted. "H—huh? There can be different versions of Jomi? T—then where's my Jomi?" asked Mijo, as the other Jomi was staring off. "I.. understand.. but.. Jomi..? Where can I start in this world? Maybe I can go and find my Jomi, and help you in the process." said Mijo, as Jomi finally paid attention to him and responded, "Go. You're dismissed. Just follow the forest nearby. Come back tomorrow if you want, because it's almost night." as Jomi continued to stare off into the distance. "Oh, night? Don't worry.. Jomi, I'll be fine. I'll come back if I don't find anything, good.. ni— no, um.. bye." said Mijo before he left the tent.

He greeted the guards goodbye before leaving, "¡¡Adios!!" says Mijo as he goes to the forest, the sky being pitch black with only the singular moon to reflect light. "I wonder what I'll find in the forest..?" asked Mijo to himself as he walked to the forest, sheath in hand for any dangers. He walks around until he hears some fighting happening nearby. "Oh? Time for me to save the day! Hopefully it's not that queen immediately haha.." said Mijo to himself as he ran to the noise. He saw Rhida and a Jomi fight side-by-side against some armed guards with halberds. "Oh..? JOMI!! and, Rhida..?" exclaimed Mijo as he intervened and fought the guards one-by-one. "Mijo? Mijo! Quick, let's finish up here." responded Jomi, as their combined strength finally pushed the guards out, forcing them to retreat.

"Finally! Me and Rhida were fighting them for a while now... Whew.. Mijo, you found any place where we can stay for the night?" asked Jomi, as Rhida is close behind Jomi, not saying anything. "Oh, uh yeah. But you're going to be pretty surprised when we enter the place, come on, follow me, I know where to go this time, haha.." said Mijo, before the other two followed. "So.. what do you get out of this dark world? Now usually I would do it, but I was ambushed before I could find my way.. It seems that they were targeting me though.." said Jomi, as Mijo and Rhida remained silent due to one another. "Mmm? Mijo?" questioned Jomi, as she looked at both of them. "Oh right.. Well, either way.. Mijo, you gotta tell us what's been happening here.."

"Mmm.. Well, go see for yourself." said Mijo, as they are back in the base with a bunch of the people there now looking at Jomi and Rhida weirdly. "Huh? Do these people know me or something?"

"Well.. not exactly.. come with me." Mijo directs the two to a tent. "Hmm.. Rhida, do you want to go inside too?" asked Mijo, as Rhida stopped and shook her head. "Huh? Why?" asked Jomi, as she was confused why Rhida didn't want to go inside. "Don't worry, Jomi. I.. think it's reasonable." said Mijo, as he dragged a confused Jomi inside.

Jomi saw Jomi, and they were both shocked. "Ok, so we're both clear, you're Jomi 1," Mijo points at the Jomi he just dragged inside. "and you're Jomi 2. Got it?" Mijo points to the Jomi sitting on a chair. "W—who are you?!" said both Jomi's at the same time. "T—this.. is.. impossible! If there are versions of me, then.. then.." Jomi 1 said, trailing off. "Mijo.. ¡¿¿Por qué la trajiste aquí??!" asked Jomi 2, as she stood up.

"Ah.. well.. I just.. you know.. If I.. put the two of you together here, you'll merge? Look, I.. just.. don't know what to do with two Jomis.." said Mijo, as he scratched his head. "Um, other Jomi, ¿Has leído sobre algún acontecimiento como éste?" asked Jomi 1, with concern all over her face.

"Sí, literalmente ahora mismo. O vivimos los dos una doble vida o... uno de los dos tiene que.. _morir._" said Jomi 2, as she was avoiding looking at Jomi 1 or Mijo. "¡¿Morir?! Wait.. Uh, I mean, you guys can coexist right? No one has to die— um.. yeah." commented Mijo, as the eerie silence took over the tent.

"Hmm.. No sé.. Porque.. This hasn't happened before— anything after this, it's unknown territory." explained Jomi 2, as she slumped over her chair, a bit weary. "It's weird.. if.. we're.. you know, versions of Mijo, then how can there be two versions of an already equivalent..?" asked Jomi 1, as she sat on the floor nearby.

"Ah.. well, have I told you about the second notebook I have?" said Mijo, with a bit of a smirk. "¡¡¿Que?!!" said the two Jomi's. "H—hold on.. So.. if you have the pink notebook.. what's the other one? Purple?" asked Jomi 1. "Blue.. But it has.. a.. cover. Like; 'Everything starts with an idea, be creative!' "

The two Jomi's look at each other, unamused. Jomi 1 turns to Mijo. "Really.." Jomi stares down Mijo as Jomi 2 spoke up again. "Well, what's done is done. Either way, we need to continue this, without one of us dying." 

"Yeah, estoy de acuerdo." Jomi 1 turns to Jomi 2. "I have an idea, double life. We both attend both of our duties, same name, but to people that know.. uh.. I am.. Jomba, and your Jombi."

"Good idea. But, what if someone overhears?" Jombi asks, with a thoughtful look. "Then we acknowledge it, it's just a simple mod, and it's not like there's going to be a difference.. well, noticeable difference." answered Jomba, as she stood up.

"But.. how can we tell you two apart? Like it's if you took Jomi and cloned her! So for example, if I met Jomi in the rebel camp, how do I know if it's actually Jombi or Jomba?" asked Rhida, as Mijo nodded in agreement. Mijo looked at Rhida again, as she just recently entered without him noticing. "Hey, Jomba.. I have an idea, but.. it's important that only **you** hear this." said Jombi, as she whispered something incomprehensible to the other two.

"Ah.. si.. ¿Es eso posible? Hmm.. Lo pensaré... Pero tendré una respuesta.. **mañana.**" said Jomba, as she heard Jombi's whisper. "Hmm.. Ah. Well, I guess it's up to you two Jomis' to take care of whatever happened.. Can we rest now or something?" asked Mijo, as Jombi pulled back from Jomba's ear. "Yeah. Uh.. Jomba, do you have any extra or free tents we can use?" asks Jombi as Jomba nodded and whispered to her. 

"Oh. Ok, got it." said Jombi before she pulled back. "Alright, see you. Jomi." said Jombi to Jomba as she directed the lightners out of the tent. "Hey.. why do you two keep whispering to each other..? Hmph. I thought we were done with secrets, hmm?" teased Mijo, as Rhida nodded in agreement. "It's something important. It's between Jomis'.. it'll make sense soon, just wait."  answered Jomi, as they arrived at a free tent and nearby an abandoned building.

"Hmm.. wait how are we getting out of here?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nodded in agreement. "Oh right. Hmm.. Hey, let's go to that building right there." said Jomi before she walked to the abandoned building as the other two followed. Once they arrived they saw more clearly what the abandoned building looked like it used to be a classroom, but it has now been devastated by war. "Oh wow. It's another classroom, go figures." commented Mijo, before Jomi stopped at the middle of the building.

## Summary:

Something has been taken inside Mijo, and yet he doesn't know what or why, he feels a lot of mixed emotions of guilt, anger, sadness but most of the time faint numbness.

CAT - Citizen's Army Training

## Author's Note:

Combining some scenes that are too episodic to combine properly, also a test of my strength. This is in line with this release.

Also, as you can see, I've been going through it, as seen with my current writing, so apologies, if you want C3S1 or C5S2 to be done, It's getting there, but it's true release is in the indefinite future.

Edit 1: By the way, this spinoff is assuming that you read C5S2, before and during it. Yeah, it's that expansive. 
Anyways, it's a culmination of drafts for C5S2 as well as some scenes from not-finished spinoffs. 
I do know that some of the chapters I have mentioned aren't done yet, but once it's done, you'll see why. — jmb~ | Oct 4, 12:26

Edit 2: C6S2 baby. Anyways, above makes more sense again. — jmb~ | Oct 5, 16:26

_Friday, outside the classroom, near the hallway balcony_

Mijo is listening to somber melancholic music, as he looks out to the intense rain happening right in front of him.

"I am a failure..." Mijo says, as he looks out, alone with his thoughts. "I can't keep up. I can't. The pressure.. it.. broke me." Mijo continues, as he continues to be alone in his own thoughts.

"I am no longer fit to be any position of power." Mijo says again, repeating his own thoughts. "I should.. listen, and stay dead. The willpower? Gone. That fire? Gone." Mijo continued, tears almost flowing out before he stopped himself.

"No one's here to comfort me. Rhida's busy with research, Kai (Ikari) and Lauv (Lauvielle), they've both gone home. Urda's on some, random stuff.. But, she's still busy. I know that perfectly well." Mijo looks to his right, seeing Urda with some of her other friends. Mijo looks back to the rain, he felt the rain getting more intense, he's not sure if it's his imagination anymore.

"It's lucky.. that we even got a half day today. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do." Mijo looked to his left, he sees JR walking out. But then, Lauvielle appeared and he looked away. "That's probably for research, forget about it. I don't think they need more of.. this." said Mijo, before he picked up his bag and left his spot. 

He went down the stairs, noticing the flooding on his feet. Then he walked slowly through the corridors of the school, passing by people worried for their research. Afterwards, he walked past his old classrooms. "Oh.. these.."  murmured Mijo to himself, as he continued walking. Soon after, he arrived at a waiting area. He noticed Ikari there.

"Kai..?" said Mijo, as he went closer to her. "Yeah, it's me! You're stuck here too? Are you commuting? The rain's really heavy right now..!" said Ikari, as he put down his bags nearby. "Yeah, I am commuting.. I just have to wait for this to end." said Mijo as he watched the rain fall. Ikari noticed his unusual attitude, he was nonchalant, but he's... too calm. But, she didn't push it, she had her own problems anyway.

"Yeah, I am waiting for my dad, which by the way, was supposed to be arriving.. thirty minutes ago!" ranted Ikari, as she also watched the rain. "Oh, that's.. funny.. haha." remarked Mijo, his laugh being a bit more fake than she expected. "Hmph. You're lucky. My dad's arriving after that online quiz is done, plus my bilao painting." joked Ikari, as she waited impatiently for her dad.

"Oh, cool." said Mijo, a bit nonchalant. "Mijo! The water.. it's.. overflowing the drainage, quick! Let's go!" said Ikari, noticing the flooding and another nearby elevated waiting area. Mijo nods and they head there, making their shoes wet but the clothes not so much. They arrive at the other waiting area, catching their breath. "Whew.. it's a good thing this piece of shit plastic envelope didn't fail and my laptop died from one drop of rainwater." commented Ikari, as she washed off the droplets of rain on her envelope.

"Haha.. yeah.." responded Mijo, trying to keep up with the conversation. "Anyways.. This mfer.. is going to take as long as if I walked home, twice!" continued Ikari, as she frantically looked at her phone. "True.." Mijo stops himself, he was going to joke about how he could've also walked home, but he didn't know what Ikari would think. "Well.. I don't fucking know what to do now.." Ikari crossed her arms and was looking at the vehicles on the road as the rain continued to pour.

Mijo looks at their surroundings, he doesn't want to disturb Ikari about his problems, since he knows of her family and school problems, he doesn't want to add on to that. "It's 2:30.." remarked Mijo, before Ikari screamed in frustration. "There he is! Fucking god.." said Ikari, as she points to a tricycle that looked like Ikari's dad. "Well.. see you, Mijo. Bye~~~" said Ikari, as she rushed to the tricycle, leaving Mijo in the waiting area. "I should go. The rain is weakening." said Mijo as he walked in the rain, eventually commuting and going home, not before noticing the argument between Ikari and her father.

_Next week, Monday, at the Dark World_

"Hey..! Mijo." said Jomi, as she greets him with a hand wave. "Mhm." Mijo dismissed her and continued walking. "Huh? Mijo.." Jomi walks up to him but he pushes her back. "No. Stay away." Mijo says to Jomi firmly as he continues on his way, his destination unclear. "Mijo..? I.. can't let you be alone, y'know. I gotta at least know." said Jomi, before Mijo glared at her with his lightning magic flaring. He stares at her, his lightning magic all around him before he looks away, turning his back and says, "I'm going to Nuevo León." said Mijo before walking to the portal that took them there.

"Wait! Why..!" shouted Jomi as she ran to Mijo, he already entered the portal so she stopped on the edge of the portal doorway. "What is he doing.." muttered Jomi to herself, as Rhida arrived at the dark world and saw Jomi. "Hey, Jomi? Were you about to go to Nuevo León?" asked Rhida, as Jomi stepped back, a bit surprised but nodded. "Oh, ok. Did you see Mi-mi around here?" asked Jomi, referring to Mijo. "Yeah, he went in. Let's find him, I don't think he's in a good headspace." said Jomi, as they went inside and saw the familiar walls.

"Ok, so.. where could he have gone.. hold on, let me detect his energy." said Jomi, as she does some magical spell. "Wait? You can do that?" asked Rhida, as Jomi awkwardly smiled as she finished the spell. "Uh.. yeah.. I had to.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll teach it later. It involves.. a lot more intimacy that you probably don't want to hear about, don't worry, just follow me, and you'll find your boyfriend, ok?" said Jomi, with a smile as Rhida chuckled and responded, "Alright. You know me. Let's go." Rhida and Jomi walked, Jomi following something invisible to everybody else.

Eventually they arrive at a random part of a huge forest, as they hear fighting. "Hm, I think that's him. Keep your weapons ready, just in case." Jomi summons her ōdachi, while Rhida summons her ice sword. "Ready, Jomi." said Rhida, before they approached the noise. As soon as they arrive, they see Mijo letting loose on some grunts and monsters around the forest, decimating them one-by-one. He's wearing headphones that seem to not go off of him as he slashes and dices the monsters with anger that he seemed to be letting out.

He noticed them, but he doesn't care, he continues his onslaught against the grunts and monsters, as the two looked on, very concerned. "Jomi.. you know how to deal with this..?" whispered Rhida to Jomi. "I.. uh.. I guess you haven't seen much of his darker side, no?" whispered back Jomi. "What.. um.. explain." responded Rhida, before Mijo finished and looked at the two. "You found me, huh? Well, whatever. Let me make it clear," said Mijo, before he pointed his ōdachi and sheath at the two. "don't come for me. Else you'll get my wrath."

The two freeze on the spot, Rhida is frozen, she'd truly never seen him like this before, and she'd not even talked to him for a month or two, so she doesn't know what to make of her boyfriend's new attitude. "Mijo..? I understand needing to be alone, but.. you know this is just inflicting endless pain on others, even if we're their enemies." said Jomi, as Mijo stumbled back a bit before raising his sword again. He falters a bit in his words, "I.. stop. SHUT UP!" Mijo teleports to Jomi, their swords clashing.

Rhida takes a step back, now shaking, as she doesn't know what to do with the two people she considers to be close friends, fighting. "Please, Mijo. You know we can.. alleviate this at least. Please, put the sword down. Let us talk. Rhida's here right? She's your love, and I am your other side, I don't know if we can fix your problems, but.. lashing out like this, isn't the solution." said Jomi, as Mijo's magic falters a bit, the words getting to him. 

"I.. can't take it anymore! Jomi! You know how much I feel every fucking day! I am stuck, in a seat for 7 hours, far away from my friends, my loved ones, you! Just so school can give me a grade I feel hollow for. I feel alone, no matter how much you say, I can't say I am happy for most of the times I live on this fuckin world. Even here, I can't feel anything when I am not angry or crying at the edge of a cliff. So! If you're the true therapist and mature one between the two of us, tell me. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG. WITH ME?!!" responded Mijo to Jomi, as Rhida teared up, seeing herself in him as well as empathy for her lover.

Jomi went silent. Mijo quickly pulled back before summoning slashes against Jomi, forcing her to parry. "I.. want to help you, Mijo.." said Jomi as she kept deflecting and dodging Mijo's continuous attacks. "But.. you're forcing my hand.." said Jomi, as she began to attack as well. "Stop! Please! Mijo, calm down!! Jomi, please find a way to calm him down!" shouted Rhida, as both of the two stopped. "I.. know." said Jomi, as she saw Mijo's lightning flicker a bit. Mijo looked at Rhida, then Jomi, before stabbing himself in the heart. "MIJO!!!" shouted the other two, as the two ran to his body. "I.. don't think he can die. But, he's.. escaping us. I'll try to heal it, but.. I don't think I am welcome in Mijo's mind." said Jomi, as she healed him after pulling the sword out.

"I.. I can try." said Rhida as she looked at Mijo, concerned. "Hmm.. Good point. I'll transport you in there right now, do note that your body here will go limp due to the transfer of consciousness." explained Jomi, as Rhida looked at hands and chest before nodding. "Ok, I acknowledge." said Rhida, before Jomi did a magical spell and Rhida fainted.

"Whew.. I.. guess that's weird.. I wonder if that's how Jomi does it.." said Rhida, before she saw Mijo, in his school clothing. They're at a hallway of their school, near their current classrooms. "Oh, well.. that makes sense." Rhida walks up to Mijo. "Hey.. Mijo?" Mijo turned around, very imposing on Rhida. Mijo's eyes were narrowed before going back to normal. "Oh, Rhida. What are you doing here?" asked Mijo, as he looked behind her. "Um, uh.. I.. just wanted to speak to you. Like before, haha."

"Hm? I thought you didn't go to school today. From what I've heard at least." said Mijo, as Rhida eyes widened. "Oh, really..? Um, well.. I  am here, now." said Rhida, as she realized that in Mijo's dream, she's already gone. "I see." said Mijo as he stared off absent-mindedly behind him. "This is a dream, isn't it?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Yeah. Uh, did you know..?"

 "Well, I was doubtful if this was real. But now you're here, It's a dream." said Mijo, as he looked back at Rhida. Rhida teared up a bit, she didn't know why. "Ah.. um.. I.. I see." said Rhida, looking at a stern Mijo. "You're.. different. I don't think I ever talked to you in my dreams. You even approached me." remarked Mijo, as he looked away. "Because.." Rhida says in-between sobs. "I am Rhida.. The real one, I was brought here by Jomi. She's.. healing you right now."

Mijo doesn't even react, but he stops for a while, before turning to look at Rhida. "Hm. I guess that's expected. But, I didn't know _you_ would be here." said Mijo, as his face remained neutral. "Ah.. well, this is all so new to me anyway. I.. I.." said Rhida before she hugged him. Mijo was initially surprised, but returned the hug, patting her back. "Hey.. hey, what's the problem? I.." asked Mijo before stopping himself. "It's just.. I can't bear seeing you like this, Mijo.. Why didn't you tell me..? We promised to talk to each other without hiding anything, remember?"

Mijo remained silent, as his body stiffened. "Please.. Mijo, you can let it out. We're in a dream.. and, I promise, I won't tell anyone. Not even Jomi— if you don't want to." said Rhida, as Mijo tightened the hug. "Tell her. She deserves to know." responded Mijo, as they both pulled back. 

"Okay. Just so you know, I've.. always felt alone. I don't want to admit it, because.. it's selfish, no? I've been surrounded with people willing to help me, and yet I feel alone? What's this, just talk with them, it's not that hard.." explained Mijo, as Rhida listened intently, calming down. "Yet, I do still feel it... I admit, even with my achievements, and successes, I doubt myself. I can't figure out if I should be confident because I can't find the balance between self-criticism and self-assurance." continued Mijo, as he walked to the balcony in their second floor hallway.

"This.. pressure to stay and maintain scores, quizzes, performance tasks, and my facade of staying obedient to these.. these.. officers. I don't get it anymore, I am losing the battle, and it feels so hard to keep fighting. The teachers' don't help, I understand their comments on the class, but I.. feel like they **try** to understand us, but each individual has different problems, issues that some might help, but others make it worse." continues Mijo, as Rhida moved to his left and looked at him thoughtfully.

"I.. just feel so hopeless. I want to escape, but every time.. It makes things worse, so.. it repeats. I feel worse, so I escape, but that makes things worse, so repeat." Mijo looks at Rhida, disappointed. "The worst part is.. it's inherent in my behavior. I don't think I or Jomi have told you this before, but.. we both came to consensus that both of us have some form of either ADHD or Autism." said Mijo, as Rhida widened her eyes. "Since, you know.. we are **kinda** related—" said Mijo, with a smile and a wink. "—we both have this.. form. So, while she can manage it, due to her prowess and.. well, just being more powerful with her life, she manages it quite well. I asked her about it, some time ago."

Rhida nods, as Mijo continued. "I.. know, this is a monologue, but you came into my dream so.. haha.. Anyways, because of our differences in our situation about our own support systems and control of our lives, I have.. a more rash personality. Even though, yes.. I am better at fighting, she's generally good at magic. Basically my ideal self. I guess.. I have to admit, while I look very masculine, I have an interest in other forms, like Jomi's. Another form of escapism, I guess." Mijo takes a huge breath as he turns to Rhida, his head closer to her head. "I think Jomi's done." Mijo kissed Rhida, as she was initially surprised but quickly returned the long kiss, as Mijo woke up.

The two are in the same bed, with the two cuddling each other, as Jomi watches them, with a grin. As soon as the two returned to their life, the two felt each other and quickly pulled back. "Ah! M—Mijo..?" said Rhida, as Mijo responded, "Rhida..!" as they look at each other, both flustered. "Oh, you two are awake.. I was beginning to think that Mijo was doing more intimate stuff with you." said Jomi, talking to Rhida, the closer one to her.

"H—Hey! I swear.. there'll be a day I'll get back at you.." said Rhida, a bit flustered but smiling. "Wingwoman Jomi, as always." added Mijo, as the other two chuckled a bit. "Alright. Well, let's go. Unless you want me to leave?" asked Jomi, with a grin. "HEY! Jomi, come on girl.." Rhida is blushing more as she gets out of bed. "Well, I feel much better. Let's go, before we run out of free time." said Mijo, smiling for the first time in a while as he got out of bed. "Awww.. Mijo..! Anyways, yeah I agree. Let's go out, I got some errands we can do together, haha!" said Jomi as they both left the tent.

_Next day, Wednesday, at the classroom, it's during their free time_

Mijo looks around his classroom, seeing his friends chatting to each other. He looked at the right, seeing Ikari and Lauvielle, talking with his other classmates. Then to his left, Dani and Candi, his research group mates with some other people.

"Again.. alone." mumbled Mijo to himself, while listening to music that echoed his thoughts of a cycle he never seemed to break out of, a depressive one at that. "Self-imposed one at that. I _wish_ I can just.. talk about me, and myself.. But, then.. I would sound narcissistic." continued Mijo, while looking at Ikari and Lauvielle. 

"If I could.. retrace every wrong move, I would.. If I could  take the blame I would. But just washing it aside, pretending I don't feel misplaced, it's so much easier than change..!" mumbled Mijo, repeating the lyrics of the music he's listening to. 

He stops listening and puts his earphones into his bag, as tears flow from his face. He quickly hides it and wipes it away with his handkerchief. Then he looks at the outside of his classroom, he sees the day, but he can't help but feel weird when looking at specific people. Specifically the CAT officers and Justina.

"I.. don't know how to feel about these officers, they're what caused my.. headspace right now, but they're also acquaintances, one of them even friends." said Mijo to himself, as he looked at Cani and Dani, before looking away.

"I just.. I remember yesterday.. It's hard to keep yourself steady when you know you have to focus on their words, your thoughts and feelings. After that, I have no room for my own words, I don't need to speak, so I don't." said Mijo as he looked at his hands, trembling. "Justina. She's.. trans. I.. just. I wish I could introduce her to the dark world.. But, we're not friends. I don't trust anyone else. I also hold authority to decide who to trust with it, since me and Urda discovered it first." continued Mijo, as he turned to look at Justina on the brink of breaking mentally.

_Fast forward to after school, Mijo's walking around the school_

"I feel guilty. But I shouldn't be. I feel alone. I shouldn't. I feel sad, I shouldn't. I.. should love myself, and trust myself, but.. I don't." said Mijo, looking away, staring off into the distance. "Every time.." Mijo turned to look at the CAT officers marching with sabres and replica guns. He quickly looked away, feeling a sense of dread whenever he saw them or the uniform they wore. "They told me, I should salute them every time I meet them.. I don't remember the rest, I don't trust myself that much that any place I remember, like the hallways and the canteen are strictly forbidden." continued Mijo, as he looked at the new building that was slowly being cleaned up after the reconstruction.

"I wonder, what's going to happen there? It's weird, it's.. blue and white. Compared to the usual green and peach color of the other older buildings. It makes sense, since it was built with sponsorship from that security bank, but why do they have their own special color instead of following the Honrato one..?" commented Mijo, momentarily distracting himself before returning to face the CAT officers. "I.. don't have the courage nor the self-confidence to face the might of the organization and club adviser on the reasons I shouldn't be in, or for that matter why it shouldn't be mandatory or even just letting me live!" said Mijo to himself, as he went silent and stared at them with angst. 

"I am not even an officer. Just a cadet, like a conscript into the military." said Mijo, before he saw his parents were nearby to pick him up. "I think they'll get it, but.. when we both get home, there's a sense of exhaustion.. They're also busy with their own stuff. I am afraid, and it's very unfortunate that.. I will only speak to them if my situation's very bad." said Mijo, as he picked up his bag and went to his parents.

_Next day, Thursday, Mijo is in the dark world, on his usual training, fighting some monster holograms_

Mijo is fighting some holograms, as he usually does. He's training his fighting skills, as he uses a variety of weapons. Although, when Ikari arrived, a conversation started.

"Hey. Mijo." greeted Ikari, with a more serious tone than usual. "Oh, yeah?" asked Mijo as he turned off the holograms and they went to nearby chairs to talk. 

"Can I get very real, just like this once, dude?" asked Ikari, as Mijo nodded. "I don't like Lauvielle anymore, and I don't think she particularly does either." said Ikari, as Mijo grimaced at these words. "I don't like how they always leave me out of stuff. Remember when she went into the dark world with a lot of people? I wasn't invited and when I arrived, they were already around the city." continued Ikari, as Mijo expressed disappointment. "I see. I think that was yesterday, right?" asked Mijo, as Ikari nodded. Mijo stood up and said, "Well.. I guess it's up to you. This is between you and Lauvielle." Ikari also stood up, with a grin and said, "Yeah. Anyways, I'll be at that gaming section in the city if you need me, bye!" said Ikari, as she waved goodbye, more relieved.

"I realize.. that it's a cycle." Mijo sits down again, putting his sword down nearby. " A cycle of—" Mijo is cut off by Jomi, running to the training area. "Whew.. Was I late, Mijo?" asked Jomi, looking very rushed. "Why... oh right. I did say to you yesterday you should be here.. Actually, the time I provided was probably too early. You came here at the right time."

"Good. For a second, I thought you would chastise me for my lateness, haha!" said Jomi as she sat down. "Nah. That would be _very_ hypocritical of me." said Mijo, as Jomi chuckled. "I forget.. haha.. anyways, so what did you want to talk about? Um, continue." asked Jomi, as Mijo took a deep breath and sighed.

"Again, it's a cycle. A cycle of a little bit of happiness and the deepest darkest abyssal depression you've experienced. I.. know, it's kinda weird to talk to someone who actually experienced abuse. Because.. it's.. bad right? It feels like comparing this is also bad, but.. I can't help it. Jomi, be honest. What do you think about the 'trauma' we both went through?" asked Mijo, as Jomi was concerned but understanding.

"The trauma..? I.. don't consider yours.. necessarily easier to go through than mine. I don't think we can compare traumas, you're right. What really matters is how it affects us, because.. while we can argue what is worse, which by your implication, you think mine.. This sense of trauma and stress affects us all the same." explained Jomi, as she looked away in deep thought.

"I.. guess. I just needed to hear it from a different perspective. Still, how do you actually go through life with that past burden? Do you experience anything that you'd consider to be a trauma response, or have you healed from it..?" asked Mijo, as Jomi kept her eyes off of him, deep in thought.

"Healing..? Well, how about you first? I.. don't know if I can say anything, since I am so busy with my governmental work that I live without self reflection most of the time. I don't consider this, because.. I am.. content..? Get it? Often, hard times make me self-reflect but.. for these past few months, it's been the usual paperwork and inspections.. I don't remember much if I experienced it before this era, all I know is I don't know." responded Jomi, as she teared up a bit for unknown reasons to her.

"I.. see. I always thought that you have more.. mature problems, like I have school while you run an entire kingdom so the problems are way different, but yeah, I can see that happening if I wasn't alone most of the day, willingly. I.. just wished that I could change something.. by myself. Like here, I am powerful enough to change the course of the dark world but.. then again, it's almost always better collectively. So, instead I am paralyzed in my decisions." said Mijo, as Jomi looked back at him, very concerned.

"I.. see. Powerless? Yeah, I've been there, as you know. It.. can be damaging to your motivation, and even willpower and the only saving grace.. is everybody around you. I would assume that you truly don't have anyone to lean to, to fight your inner demons. Except, I can also assume that.. well, you have people, it's just you don't know if you can share them right? I saw this with Rhida, you were willing to keep it to yourself until it started hurting more than just you. You're self-sacrificial, right? You would rather bear the burden so others don't, seeing as how I am on a high position and you're the hero of this world.. This is your ideal, correct?" analyzed Jomi, as Mijo sadly nodded.

"Yeah. You're correct. Of course, you know me the most. Both willingly and unwillingly. It's easier to run to you, or fight random enemies instead of facing insurmountable enemies that force is simply useless against. I can physically harm myself, so what? I die, I surrender, if I don't then I am more wounded than before. It's.. like I am sick of being stuck. Rigid and still, but.. I want to move like the wind or as fast as lightning." said Mijo, as he looked at his weapon.

"So, what..? There's still.. a lot to do, to be honest. But, I am here for you. Until I can't physically go to you, I'll always be here. Other matters can wait, if it wasn't for you and her, I wouldn't be here. Anyways, looks like our time ran out. Wanna help in some matters concerning a couple of abyss monsters? It's easy, haha." said Jomi, as she looked at him with a bit of a smile.

"Of course. I would rather spend these days happy, than melancholic. Let's go, Her Majesty's Royal—" said Mijo before Jomi nudged him. "Hey! No need to say my full title.. I don't even use it, come on... Do I call you Mijo—" said Jomi before Mijo cuts her off. "I get it. I was just mocking it, seriously.. Why do you royals always have long names? It's not like having short ones will significantly affect your status.. If that's the case, I am sorry but your kingdom sucked." continued Mijo, as Jomi chuckled. "Well.. I haven't been an actual royal for a long time, so I'll get back to you on that, haha~~" added Jomi, before they headed out of the training area.

_Next day, Friday, Teacher's Day, near the classroom_

Mijo is staring absent-mindedly at the current celebration of the day, and as he does so, he is reminded that he's a part of the class and the student population.

"Hey dude!" greeted Urda as she is with Reeb. "Oh! Hi!" responded Mijo to Urda before they did a personal handshake. "Oh, you guys are close huh? Well, Urda.. You want me to leave?" asked Reeb as Urda answered, "Do whatever you want man.. You can listen or whatever." Reeb nodded and waves to Mijo, as Mijo waved back.

"Aight." said Mijo as Urda went closer, Reeb maintained her distance. "Anyways dude, any thing? I mean, it's been a while since we last talked IRL.. or even online to be honest.." said Urda, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I agree. I was just busy with my stuff.. You never got.. well, we can't be together bro, the segregation of special sections is reeeal.." responded Mijo, as Urda smiled. 

"Haha, yeah. I am still thankful for no spanish subject, but it's a shame that we can't talk much anymore. You always seem to be in another world whenever I see you, either having earphones on or staring off into the distance." observed Urda, as Mijo quickly looked away, a bit embarrassed. "True, true.. I assumed no one would talk with me, so I did that. Our schedules' in the dark world are even different now! You're the earlier one, so really after that other schedule change we haven't done sparring in a while." responded Mijo, as he looked back, a small smile forming on his lips.

"Yeah, we should probably start making time.. Oh, I still have to work on that manuscript with Ikari tomorrow.. Anyways, later, let's play that newest update in Wavey Waves 1.3, it's a new area too, so more exploration stuff.." said Urda, as Mijo nodded, forming a full smile. "Goods! You got anything else important?" asked Mijo, as Urda shook her head. "Nah bro. Oh, yeah.. The dark world later, ok? Byee!" said Urda as she went to Reeb.

"Hmm.. that reminds me, I should check up on... _her._" muttered Mijo to himself, as he put his phone into his sling bag and walked to the next-door classroom. "Hmm.. oh JR. Perfect." murmured Mijo as he sees JR. "Hey, JR.. You know where.. uhh.. _she_ is?" asked Mijo, as JR was a bit confused, then quickly figured the person out. "Oh, Rhida? She's not inside. I think she's busy with some work on the event later.. Though, a suggestion.. you should probably wait until later, like until the dark world opens. She probably told you, but she **is** really busy this time." answered JR, as Mijo nodded. 

"I see. JR, any updates? On yourself, I mean." asked Mijo, as JR looked at his phone before he directed him to the balcony wall. "Well, it's nothing much. I am also busy by the way, but I took a break for myself this time for lunch. It's parol making, and I have to do it until next week wed." JR takes a big sigh. "I just wanna graduate man.. I mean, just living the life like this? Well.. I at least have to enjoy it, unlike before. Days pass anyway." 

"Oh, I see. Oh yeah, we went to UECL. Met Sir Kulay. Got the research reviewed and consulted. That's.. it, pretty much." said Mijo, as JR nodded. "Hm. ok. Oh, I am leaving now, still buying food so.. bye, Mijo!" said JR before he left.

"Alright. That's settled. Hmm.. Oh, the others. Time to head back." said Mijo, as he went back to his classroom.

_Fast forward to the Dark World, Mijo just jumped in_

Mijo saw the amount of fighting in front of him. Jomi's Elite Guards are attacking the abyss monsters as Urda shows up behind him. "Oh, damn. Monsters. Easy, these guards have a fighting chance. That means we can safely assume they're weak." said Urda as she summoned her swords. "Finally, some **real** _fucking_ action."

"Mhm. _Agreed._" said Mijo, as he summoned his sword. "Split up. These monsters might be weak, but they're hordes. Let's go." added Mijo, as they both nodded. They went different ways, Mijo to the left, and Urda to the right. 

Mijo easily slashed through the monsters, methodical and strategic. He hadn't been expecting to fight, but he still wasn't rusty so he fought them easily. As he went through the enemies, he saw a familiar enemy in his periphery.

"Surprise~ " said Cara, an old enemy he didn't know would appear, he was quickly knocked back. "Agh! It's.. you.. Cara? How.." asked Mijo, as Cara possessed Jomi and held her sword. "Wait.. you.. how?" questioned Mijo, as he stood up, sword pointed at her. "Hello, again. Miss me? Well, here I am, with the doctor's advice~ " explained Cara, as she held up Jomi's sword. "This? Well, we share this body, why not use it again? I mean, I only repossessed her, ehe~ "

"You..? Fudge.. FUCK YOU!" said Mijo, before he teleported and started attacking her. "Mmm~" Cara surprised Mijo, and he managed to dodge but he stopped attacking. "Damn it.. There's no way I can defeat you yet. My energy is spent. Jomi is obviously compromised.. Well, The Dark Pearl." said Mijo as he ran away. "Hm? Mijo, let's have a fair one on one." said Cara as she teleported to Mijo. They clashed blades, but Mijo managed to quickly deflect and teleport away. 

"Where the fuck am I going.. where.. where is.. this.." Mijo gasps as he sees Rhida fighting some abyss monsters. "Bad timing.. or good? Whatever." Mijo ran to Rhida, and he stopped just beside her to look around. "Good. _She_ isn't here." commented Mijo, as he turned to focus on Rhida. "Who? Jomi..? Is it a good thing that the lead commander is missing?" asked Rhida as Mijo stopped for a moment then answered, "Well.. to be exact, remember the first cataclysm? Where Jomi was corrupted by this abyss being? Well, apparently she decided to try a 3rd time. After.. she tried on me, during the student's night." explained Mijo, as Rhida immediately became concerned. 

"Oh, I thought this was the typical weekly infestation.. They always seem to arrive at these important events. Maybe we should—" remarked Rhida, before a certain blade slashed Rhida's right side, knocking her back to Mijo's body. Then the intruder was clearly visible to both of them, Cara.

"Surprise!" shouted Cara as she suddenly summoned a purple firestorm that was blocked by a huge ice wall created by Rhida, still injured. Mijo quickly sustained the defense by infusing the ice wall with electricity, in the process dealing freeze damage to the three, but that is enough to stop Cara's attacks, and destroy the ice wall.

"Haha.. That's.. good. Elemental infusions? I thought you forgot about it.. but, fair enough.. It has only been a couple of months since our last meeting." said Cara, as she struggled to stand up. "It's.. uh.. yeah. So, what are you doing? What do you **really** want from us?" Mijo says as he stands up and unconsciously puts Rhida behind him.

"Testing the waters. Anyway, I am satisfied. That was a good fight. Anyways, enjoy your life or whatever you do outside here. Oh wait, lemme dig into Jomi's memories.." answered Cara as she sheathed Jomi's sword. "Oh, oh! Damn. You go through all 'at? Well, well.. I guess I'll keep this in mind. Anyways, I am leaving, see you~" said Cara waving goodbye, as Jomi faints.

"Jomi!" said Mijo as he ran to Jomi's body. "H—huh..? What happened.. how did.. shit.. Cara.. no, no.. What happened??! Mijo.." panicked Jomi, as she was helped up by Mijo. "I.. it's Cara. She's watching us with the _abyss doctor._ They're still planning something, even after the second cataclysm... Jomi, are you good though? I.. recognize your predicament." asked Mijo, as Jomi looked around her and nodded. "Yeah it's fine. Nothing I couldn't take before. She likely read my memories.. But, it doesn't matter. I also read hers. That.. needs to be compiled first.. and I am soo tired.. She used all my abyss magic.." answered Jomi as she stumbles a bit. 

"Oh, uh.. Rhida.. is **she** good?" asked Jomi, as Mijo looked at Rhida, then dragged Jomi with him to her. "Mijo.. Jomi.. Help.." trembled Rhida, as she tried to heal her own wounds. "Wait. This isn't usual magic damage. Rhida, let me deal with it.. I know how my damage works, and how to heal it." said Jomi, as she healed Rhida, a mix of green and purple energy swirling around her hand and Rhida's wounds. "Ah.. t—thanks.. this type is unknown to me.. can you teach me this?" asked Rhida as Jomi looked at her, a bit worried. "This.. requires intense use of abyss magic, which still is a very dangerous prospect for you lightners, while I still hold a lot of abyssal power." explained Jomi, as she finished and Mijo helped Rhida up.

"Wow.. this is a lot to take in to be honest. Honestly, I was just going to go on a date with my baby over here—" Rhida winks at Mijo. "But all of this, giirll.. Nakakapagod.." said Rhida as she leaned at Mijo's body, very tired. "Rhida!" said Mijo as they both fell over. "Yeah.. your Mijo here just fought a Cara so you're both tired. Anyways, we should head back to my castle, my guards are there so any stragglers should be gone." said Jomi, as the two remained on the floor. "You.. hey! I know what this is, you two are making me carry you! Hays.. whatever." continued Jomi, as she carried Rhida and Mijo, then teleported to her castle.

Jomi meets the others; JR, Urda, Lauvielle, and Ikari at the castle, chatting. Lauvielle and Urda are talking while JR and Ikari are reluctantly talking to each other.

"Hey.." greeted Jomi to the others, exhausted as she carried the two. "Oh! Jomi! What happened..?" asked Lauvielle, as Urda added, "Why are the two unconscious?"

"Um.. in short, someone attacked them. The details should be explained by them, but for now I am just going to bring them inside the castle, ok?" said Jomi, as she struggled to carry the two into the castle.

_An hour later..._

"Ugh.. What.." Mijo flutters awake as he starts to move around the bed, but he suddenly feels someone beside him. "Heh?" Mijo turned around and saw Rhida still sleeping next to him. He quickly pulled back a bit, and blushed. "O—oh.. Must've been Jomi's doing. Well.. how long did I.." said Mijo, as he grabbed his phone from the nearby table. "Oh.. it's 17:00." said Mijo, as Rhida stirred awake. "Ugh.. Mijo..? Mijo..!" said Rhida as she also pulled back, a bit flustered. "Rhida.. um.. so, it's.. 17:00.. Uh, well you can guess what caused this.. Anyways, I just awoke too." responded Mijo, as Rhida calmed down and looked at Mijo.

"Ok.. ok.. Then I should get going.. You know my sched, Mijo. Let's meet next week, hopefully in better spirits." Rhida looked away. "Or not.. There's still so much to do.. Journalism training tomorrow.. as well as that performance task.." Rhida sighs as she stands up. "Mijo, may you stay safe. Adiós, ¡hasta pronto!" said Rhida to Mijo, as she waved goodbye. "Adiós, amor." said Mijo back, as they both smiled. Rhida leaves as Mijo stands up and also gets his things.

"Things don't last.. I hate it." murmured Mijo to himself as he got his things and went outside of the room, seeing Jomi beside the door, panicking internally. "Oh, Jomi? What do you want?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked up at him. "Just something I should tell you, the abyss is still testing and preparing.. It's just, they gained this **boldness** to keep prodding us. I don't know when they will strike." explained Jomi, as Mijo switches to a concerned look. "Oh. Will you figure it out?" asked Mijo, before Jomi shook her head. "I don't know. Times are heating up again.." answered Jomi, as she looked away, sighing.

"I.. got a lot in my mind right now, Jomi. I hate going back to the light world. I hate losing my powers.. I hate being a nobody. I hate my social life there. Here, I have everything, friends, love, heck even something to be proud of, and working towards. I just.. I regret a lot of things in the past. The cycle is not easy to break, y'know? Easier to run here and face Cara and the _Abyss Doctor,_ than the school system I grew to hate. I'm sorry for dumping this on you, but.. I'll probably would've let it out anyway if I don't now." said Mijo, as he waved goodbye to Jomi.

"Let's say hello, to the imperfect tomorrow, Jomi." said Mijo, before Jomi adds, "Hopefully by then, it'll taste bittersweet." 

They wave goodbye for the last time that week, as another school week ends with a light on the horizon that was brighter last week.

## Author's Note:

Whew. That's over. I unfortunately haven't finished C5S2, to set up this one, but hopefully by next month, all shall be done. Anyway, I just realized that I write about my present so I can't seem to complete something about the past so.. there are exceptions, like if it's short like this one (notably c3s1 isn't done because it's too long).

Hopefully by now, you would've realized the context I am writing in, and at the same time, get something out of these collections of a week's worth of angst. See you, then. Whenever that is, goodbye! Stay alive, dear viewer!

<!--Chapter 7 Intramurals part 2, more buildup and potential plot related, idk what it does for now-->
<p id="C7"><md-block># C7 DeltaRambles: The Catalyst</md-block></p>

## Summary: 

The Intramurals are back again! Mijo and his friends hope that this one is relatively fun and without any cataclysmic event happening, but as fate would have it, these lightners are in for a treat.

## Author's Note:

Oh boy, C7? Isn't that the end of season 1? Hey, isn't this also just C3S2? 

Good question! Firstly, the style of the season is different anyway, and so, it doesn't end at 7, (how ironically, since that was the g8 segment) this one? IDK, maybe 12? But, I should complete the others first, haha. As for the recycling chapters one, trust me, it's something you should keep in the back of your mind, anyways!

Enjoy some sports, and angst~

—jmb~

Mijo is looking at the stage of the school gymnasium, as 'Mr. and Ms. Intramurals' is happening in front of him, he's with Ikari, right beside him, watching.

"Hmm. I guess it's good. It's a shame. Unlike last time, they restricted us to the gymnasium.. But, whatever. I can just, make a new one, maybe after the light intramurals are over." said Mijo to himself, as the contestants show themselves to the judges in front.

"Although, something feels off.. I don't know, like.." said Mijo before gasping as he felt his sword in his hand. "Huh? Wait." Mijo looks down, not seeing anything, but feeling something anyway. "What..? Must be my imagination.." Mijo looks away, as Ikari speaks, "Ugh. I swear, that candidate number 4 will win again, probably champion by this point."

"I swear, someone picked the worst partner for our classmate there, like she's so beautiful and confident, while her partner looks tall, but isn't that appealing, it's like.. he doesn't have that muscle that the judges are looking for." continued Ikari, as Mijo nodded in agreement.
"Agreed." said Mijo, now feeling a bit self-conscious about his own body. 

As they continue to watch, Mijo feels that magic again, and this time, it's getting stronger.  "Ikari, I feel like I should go to the dark world. Is that.. normal? I just told Jomi that I'll close it for two days for the intramurals.. But, I feel something's wrong." said Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and answered, "Well, I don't know. But you should probably check it out. There's nothing happening.. yet anyway." responded Ikari, before she looked at the empty stage, as the candidates were preparing their costumes for the next part.

"Ok, thanks." said Mijo before he went back to his classroom, then to the dark world. "Mijo..?" noticed Jomi, as Mijo greeted her. "Hi, Jomi. Any news I should know?" asked Mijo as Jomi looked around and shaked her head. "No, not yet. What? I know the intramurals are happening again, are you expecting **another** cataclysmic event to happen?" asked Jomi as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I just.. had this weird feeling. I mean, it's like.. I was using magic in the light world, so I'm wondering if you detected any openings." said Mijo as Jomi shaked her head again. 

"No.. huh, that's odd. Hmm, well whatever's going on, its probably best you should go back. The break isn't over and you kinda interrupted me on some preperations when you jumped in." said Jomi, as she held some boxes of random stuff. "Oh, right.. aren't yours done?" asked Mijo as Jomi shaked her head one more time. "No.. not yet. The decorations and other finishing touches aren't done yet. Don't worry, I'll show the updates made to the 'New Intramurals' line up. Me and Rhida have been working very hard to make it interesting again.. Ooh, maybe you can talk to her? She told me she's not that busy these few days."

"Hmm.. I don't know.. I kinda have my own hangouts to do, and probably she does too. Let's just.. do it later once you're done, ok? Now, I better hope you're right and there isn't a catacylsm about to happen." said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and nodded. "Yeah yeah.." said Jomi as they bid goodbye and Mijo went back to the light world.

_Hours later, at lunch break, the Intramurals wasn't finished yet and was cancelled due to a storm and typhoon named 'Kristine!', emphasis on the '!'._

"Hey Mijo!" exclaimed Ikari as she was content in her current progress in her new game inside her handheld. "Huh? Yeah?" asked Mijo as he was putting away things after eating lunch. "Let's go to the dark world again. Before we head home.." said Ikari as Mijo nodded. "Right. We might not even meet her for a couple of days. Come on then, follow me. It should still be open in my backpack.." said Mijo as he opens it somewhere unsuspecting like a secluded area of the classroom then they jump in.

Around them, there is a lot of movement, notably from Jomi's Guards. Their marches seem hurried, like they're preparing for a huge battle that's going to happen. They see Jomi hurriedly barking orders at her guards before turning her attention to them.

"Jomi? What's going on.. Come on, not another one.. We can't even stay here for long.." said Mijo as Jomi nodded. "Yeah.. another one. It's.. just, a small.. event. Uh, the war is.. restarting again in Nuevo León." said Jomi as Mijo and Ikari looked at each other in a bit of shock. "What? No fudging way!" exclaimed Mijo, as Ikari gasped. "What! Another..? Now I get your point, Mijo.. It really happens every important event.." added Ikari, as they both turned back to Jomi.

"Yeah, I'm not sure if this has something to do with the abyss or just a continuation of the political situation.. But, I will inform you as the situation unfolds." continued Jomi, with narrowed eyes. "Um.. Jomi.. we and the others might not be back.. Oh, well I can. But, not the others." said Mijo, as Ikari continued his explanation. "Yeah, we're having suspended classes for the rest of the week most likely.. That typhoon looks big.. So, if anything happens, Mijo is the only one who can help you." finished Ikari, as Jomi sighs at this almost feeling the exhaustion that wasn't obvious before.

"Oh.. that's.. unfortunate. I.. ok. I can do it, I'll handle it. Enjoy your vacation then." responded Jomi, with a twinge of sadness. 

Before, the other two could respond, a sudden earthquake engulfed the dark world as hundreds of abyss monsters started to appear, while the rest of the Dark Pearl, who were curious and also were going to say goodbye to Jomi, arrived at the worst possible time.

"What the fudge!! Really good timing there, fudging muddlefudgers!" exclaimed Mijo as Ikari added, "Fuck! What! Yooo!! Ermm we are so cooked right now..!" as Jomi hurriedly looked around and summoned her sword as hundreds of abyss monsters started appearing. "Well.. looks like we have a problem! I have to get the rest of my army.. Good luck you two!" responded Jomi before waving goodbye then unsheathing her sword to fight through the monsters to get to her other guards.

Mijo and Ikari summoned their weapons, as the abyss monsters quickly started to make chaos in the dark world. "We.. have to... can we even go home?" said Mijo as he started to fight the monsters around them. "I don't know.. but we need to stay here. We can't leave Jomi to deal with this alone... right?" responded Ikari as Mijo nodded.

"Yeah! I wonder where's the others..." said Mijo before they start fighting the surrounding monsters.

_Meanwhile, at another corner, Urda and Rhida bump into each other_

"Oof!" said Urda as she bumped into Rhida. "Ah!" exclaimed Rhida too as she also bumped into Urda.

"Ow.. uh.. Rhida?" said Urda as she looked at Rhida, a bit dazed. "Urda.." said Rhida as she looked around her. "Sorry, I didn't see you there." said Rhida, before a massive sudden earthquake shook the dark world, scaring the other darkners around them.

(For future writing: basically.. just after the whole shebang happens, the catalyst is like.. Cara right? Because she appeared during C6, and this time she got an entire army, along with the cooperation of the Nuevo León Loyalists [idk what i should call them] to do a two pronged attack against Jomi and the lightners, and the dark pearl work together to beat them again, but Cara knows this and scares them again by corrupting Jomi and Mijo, forcing the others to rehash fights Blabla you get it, but it's not finished yet, the climax is for the December exams, so next chapter probably)

"Ugh.. it has been an exhausting two weeks.." said Mijo as he looked across Dajovy at the balcony of Jomi's Castle. "Hm? Really? That must be why my workload increased a bit. The Nuevo León stuff.. Abyss Order.. yeah, now that I think about it, I'm tired too.." responded Jomi, as she leaned near him. "Mmm.. I haven't met Rhida face-to-face in a while.. She said to me in a message that she's busy with a lot of school stuff and can't come here." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi, disappointed.

"I've always wondered what happened to the ability to do work in the dark world and have it affect the light world too. It's.. odd, that just disappeared after Nuevo León appeared. Maybe that's the reason? But, I can't just.. leave it behind, they're still fighting.." said Jomi, as she moved closer to Mijo. "You think we can enjoy Christmas?" asked Mijo as he laid his head on her shoulder.

"Maybe.. but, I'm too tired to think of cool Christmas parties today.." said Jomi as she stroked her hair. "If you're tired... Just go to bed, I need some time for myself.." said Mijo, as he looked at her again. "I was going to.. but, you're here Mijo. Like I said, I'll always be here for you." said Jomi, hazy with sleep. "Fine.." said Mijo as he grabbed a sofa and put it where they were and sat down as he laid his head on Jomi's lap. "You should be doing this with your girlfriend.. But, you decide on your other self that is pretty much basically your twin sister?" teased Jomi, as they chuckled.

"Y—yeah.. Usually I'm the one that she lays on.. Luckily, we're both tall and.. fit. Yeah, that's what I call our.. ahem. as said by Rhida; _'Absolute Beauty'_..." said Mijo, as Jomi patted his head and smiled. "Absolutely Beautiful? She's a bit biased, considering her relationship with you. But, as the person part of being described.. I agree.. what? Want to discuss it?" asked Jomi, as Mijo put up a thumbs up and answered, "Just don't be overtly sexual about it.."

"Uhuh.. I get it. Anyways, I think she just likes tall people who are a bit nerdy but also awkward and strong. But, that's besides the point. What about the curves? Mijo, honest question, do you think I'm.. like sexy? Like, someone if they see me, would they be sexually attracted?" asked Jomi, as Mijo gasped in her bluntness. "Uh.. maybe? I mean.. you said it yourself.. we are both each other's ideal self.. It would be pretty biased to call you beautiful, considering your breast size, to the hair and.. bottom, I would've said that I liked it." responded Mijo, as Jomi chuckled and exclaimed "Oh right.. haha yeah.."

"Are you getting tired..? Because.. my eyes are barely open, hehe.." said Jomi as she laid on the sofa more comfortably. Mijo switched to a sitting position as he stretched his arms and legs. "Yeah.. I'm going to have to go back.. See you tomorrow, Jomi." said Mijo, as they looked at each other, half-asleep. "Hasta pronto, y ¡buenas noches!" said Jomi, as they waved goodbye to each other.

_Switching to Rhida's perspective_

"Mijo.. Mijo.." mumbled Rhida in her sleep, before she suddenly woke up. "Ah! Oh.. Um.. I thought.. um.. nevermind.. That.. was very intimate.. and.. weird." said Rhida as she felt something in her crotch area. "Ah.. wait.. why am I.." said Rhida, before blushing. "I'm cleaning up." said Rhida, before she got out of bed and headed to the bathroom and cleaned herself up.

She got out and headed back to her bed and thought about what happened, as she looked at her phone, it was 1:00. "Oh. Um.. okay. Guess I'm continuing to sleep then.. But.." said Rhida, before she put down her phone. "I.. need some time to think about what I just did.. Did I dream.. Um.. well, I dreamt about me and Mijo arriving at my house, we laughed, we enjoyed doing stuff, when the night suddenly fast-forwarded and we headed to the couch. Mijo was pretty horny there.. and I can see his.. bulge.. So, we.. um.. well.. we did the thing. It was quick though, just a quick undressing then insert.. then I woke up.. It felt like I was.. um. yeah. I guess I was very excited... Anyways, I should write this down then head back to sleep." explained Rhida to herself, before she typed on her phone's notes about her dream.

Afterwards she turned off her phone and laid down on the bed as she looked at the ceiling. "You know.. Today's after the exam.. Maybe I should meet with him, and the Dark Pearl.. I miss him.." said Rhida to herself as she tossed and turned. "I need to get my sleep though. I've already done so much.. Hopefully I can enjoy December with my friends.. and Mijo." continued Rhida, before grabbing a blanket and wrapping it to her entire body except her head then she slept.

_Days later.._

The whole gymnasium is almost brewing with excitement as the student council holds out the surprise, until..

"Alright.. alright! Of course, there's a Christmas party.. but it isn't just gonna be a Christmas party, y'know.. In December 20.. Are you ready for another _**STUDENT'S NIGHT?!!"**_ the announcer said, as the crowd of students erupted into screams and claps, as another fated day awaits the two lovebirds.

_Mijo's reaction_

He was staring off, not really paying attention until he heard the two key words. **_'Student's Night.'_**

He suddenly snapped out and his brain immediately went into processing mode. "No way.. No WAY?!" Mijo thought to himself, he wasn't the type to scream at joyous moments like this, but he was still ecstatic. "Then.." thought Mijo, as he unconsciously looked in Rhida's direction, their eyes meeting before quickly moving away. Mijo was blushing but he didn't want to check if Rhida did too, he was too embarrassed.

"So.." thought Mijo, as many thoughts of what he could do swirled around his head. "Hmm.. it's two weeks later though.. But, that just means more preparation! I wonder.." Mijo smirked as he already began writing ideas on his phone.

_Rhida's reaction_

Rhida was resting her head on Diminaque's shoulder as the announcements played, she was a bit tired, and couldn't care less about whatever the announcer said until the two key words were said. **_'Student's Night.'_**

Her head suddenly shot up as she heard the words, her heart started pounding as Diminaque looked at her with a knowing expression. "Stop looking at me like that.." said Rhida, as Diminaque chuckled and looked away. Rhida's eyes wandered over to Mijo, in-shock as she looked at Mijo's eyes looking at her. Rhida looked away immediately, blushing.

"Wow.. just 2 weeks.. then.. I'll prepare." Rhida looked at Mijo, hunched over his phone. "I am excited for what you'll do, Mi-mi.." whispered Rhida, before she looked away, thinking of what to do with the information.

_During Tuesday next week.. in the Dark World_

_"We passed upon the stairs.."_

"Oh? Mijo! You're here. Gosh, I thought the christmas break was here, but holyy!" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, things still rough." responded Mijo, as he sighed heavily.

_"We spoke of was and when.."_

"Oh! Remember~ **Student's Night!** You'll be able to dance on the dance floor, sing to your heart's content, or dance, I don't care, haha. Oh, and Rhida too! Maybe you can even convince Ikari to go, after all, she's your friend right?" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "I'll.. see." responded Mijo, looking away.

_"Although I wasn't there, she said I was her friend.."_

"Don't forget, Mijo.. I'll always be here for you, even throughout all the pain and hurt you're going through, just remember me, your friends, the world you care about." said Jomi, as she held Mijo's hand. "Ah.. okay." said Mijo, as he nodded, still apprehensive and numb about the whole thing.

_"Which came as a surprise.."_

"What? Come on, we both know I accept what your mistakes and what you've done wrong, just remember to always get help and support from me, I might be busy, but I will always make time for you." said Jomi, seeing the conflict in Mijo's eyes. "It's not.. it's just.. I've been.. I'm just so thankful that someone understood.." responded  Mijo, stammering and carrying a heavy load of emotional burden.

_"I spoke into her eyes, I thought you died alone.. A long, long time ago.._

"I.. just.. I keep thinking.. ever since the dark world opened. I felt as though I lost something, and that this.. split, this conversation.. I feel as if, I lost myself at some point, and now.. I'm not so sure that I face a person that I can be comfortable helping and healing.. I.. lost that sense of caring to save others." explained Mijo, as Jomi sighed and nodded. "I.. noticed as well. But I guess, I can't attest to something that only you can remember, so.. I trust you.. told the truth and that.. I can help you, because.. that'll allow you to help me too, it's not any pressure, it's just.. friendship." responded Jomi, as Mijo and Jomi hugged.

_Meanwhile, same Tuesday night, in the Light World, Rhida's bedroom_

"Gahh.. It's beenn.. stressful week.. Even after exams, there's still research.. and.. like, the start of the quarter already? Ayoko na, girl.." said Rhida, as she was on a voice call with her friends. "Yeah, dami eh.. it is what it is.. you have high grades naman, Rhida. You can do it, sis.." said Mack, as Diminaque added with a hint of sarcasm. "Hey who knows? Siguro, if Mijo sees your grades, he won't have a reason to deny you~"

"Hey..! He's not that.. focused on the grades, okay? But.. um.. I gotta go sleep though, see ya!" said Rhida, as her friends bid goodbye to her. "G'night sis! Have a.. **wet** night, hehe.." said Diminaque before Rhida turned off her phone. Rhida blushed slightly at the farewell of Diminaque. "Eh?!" exclaimed as she realized what Diminaque just said.

"I shouldn't have.. eh.." said Rhida, as she laid down on her bed, tired and exhausted. "Maybe I can start planning next week..? Because.. research.. math.."  continued Rhida as she curled up with a warm blanket with a princess design. "Sometimes.. I wish tomorrow would come already.. Hmm.. my.. schoolwork anyway is mostly done.. just.. gotta.. take a nap.." mumbled Rhida, before drifting off to sleep.

_That same tuesday night, in the dark world, Jomi's castle balcony_

_I laughed and shook her hand and made my way back home.._

"Hey, Jomi, I'm going to need some alone time before I head back home, is that fine with you?" asked Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Sure! I'll leave you to yourself for now, then. If that is what you wish, then I shall sleep myself." responded Jomi, before Mijo held her hand and shook it, with a smile. "Thank you again, by the way." added Mijo, before Jomi returned the favor, with another hug before leaving.

_I searched for form and land, for years and years, I roamed.._

Mijo is walking at the midnight of the city of Dajovy, usually lively, the city sleeps tonight, as Mijo continues his walk, reflecting on what has happened. 

_I gazed a gazeless stare. we walked a million hills.._

Mijo looks at the places he visits often with his friends, now closed for the night. He looks at Jomi's Castle, the symbol of authority, of power but also leadership and guidance of the kingdom. He continued walking, seeing restaurants, gyms, food stalls, and a lot of currency based exchanging of goods, also known as shops.

_I must have died alone, a long, long time ago.._

"Who knows? Not me, I've always lost control.. You're face to face, with the man who sold his soul." sang Mijo, reflecting on his school and home life. "Oh no, not me. I've always lost control." continued Mijo, as he sat down on the empty road, looking outward for a while before standing up and turning to head back to his house up on the light world.

_Friday, videocall._

"Hey.. Mi-mi? Is everything alright? I mean.. you're not looking at me.." asked Rhida, as Mijo slightly raised his head as he looked at Rhida on his laptop screen. "Oh, um.. It's.. just.. school stuff you know. I don't pretend to be okay, but you get me. It's the usual.. boring asinine stuff that makes a person apathetic to their work." responded Mijo, as he leaned more back on his plastic chair, as Rhida nodded.
