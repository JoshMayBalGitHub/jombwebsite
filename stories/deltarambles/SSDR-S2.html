Summary: New School Year, Mijo and the gang are at it again?

It started off as a regular "first day of school". Old friends like JR and Lauvielle and new classmates for the rest of the year.

Now, Mijo and with 8-Clam, were retired from the whole "dark world" ever since they had their "last supper". Some of them were done with that type of adventure. Some moved out of the 
school, some got into bigger and better schools. The only ones still thinking about it were the first ones, Mijo and Urda. Now as "fate" would have it, they were seperated.

As lunch time broke, JR and Mijo went to the railings near the classrooms, of course after eating their dinners.

"Hey JR, how's life?" said Mijo.

"Its bad, hahanapin ko yung ibang 8-Clam wanna join?" said JR.

"Yeah sure, hope no dark worlds open-" said Mijo before a big explosion was heard coming from the bottom floor, as they were on the 2nd floor.

"Ugh, let's go save another dark world." said Mijo.

"I mean, hinahanap natin yung 8-Clam diba?" said JR.

Both of them laughed before quickly going downstairs and seeing the room nearest to the bottom CR.

"Ok, let's see what section's here..." said Mijo.

"9-Oxir..." said JR.

"Ok, hmmm..." said Mijo, searching around the students until...

"Oh, that's why," said Mijo, pointing to Urda's full name.

"Ok, let's go in." said Mijo, before going in with JR.

"Wait Mijo-" said JR before cutting himself off.

They woke up in a desert, <ins>with</ins> Urda and her new friend which Mijo recognized but couldn't remember the name of.

"Hey! Urda and..." said Mijo before getting cut off by-

"Wow, bro, does not remember my name?!?" said Reeb.

"Oh yeah! You're Reeb from Grade 7! I forgor" said Mijo.

"Bruh... We used to play Micnaft in a server!" said Reeb.

"Hi Reebs!" said JR.

"Hi JR!" said Reeb.

"Guys, let's go to the main point, who opened this world, Urda, was it you?" said Mijo.

"Ok, it was me, but like, i was explaining the dark world to Reeb but she wouldn't believe, so I opened one!" said Urda.

"To be fair, di ko siya talaga paniniwalaan, I mean, a dark world that exists? Impossible!" said Reeb.

"Weel that, and i kinda wanted to see what would happen, i honestly expected you, Mijo." said Urda.

"Well, ok, lets just fix this situation, and go back. Lunch pa lang!" said Mijo.

"Then, we can go back?" said Urda.

"Yeah, yeah, just warn me next time." said Mijo.

"Hey guys, not to be anti climactic, but andoon lang yung fountain." said JR.

"Oh well lets go-" said Mijo before getting cut off.

Two people appeared, they looked like two people who Mijo seen before with Lauvielle on occasion.

"Great, more people." said Mijo.

"Lets just close the fountain and uh, forgot this happened." said Urda.

"Wait, yo, why does our phones not work?" said Reeb.

"Yeah, no cell towers here." said Mijo.

Then they went to the fountain and as they were about to close it,

"Hey, Reeb, what's your magic?" questioned Urda.

"Uh, let's see-" said Reeb, opening up a menu that looks like... Micnaft?!

"Oh cool, can you make a- wait Mijo!" said Urda.

"What? I'm closing it, oh yeah, the powers? sure, let's see it, Reeb!" said Mijo.

"OK, wash, isn't this op?!" said Reeb, placing diamonds down.

"Yeah, but i bet it will be like super costly or very strong but only on certain worlds, i know it all, well not all, but enough." said JR.

Then the two immediately met with the rest of the group.

"Hello, fellow people, you know how to get out of here?" said the girl.

"Hmm, wait isn't this what Lauvielle was saying about, like dark worlds or somethin!" said the boy.

"Oh yeah, and the fountain, so i'am guessing you guys know who Lauvielle is?" said the girl.

"Yeah, we, well most of us know who Lauvielle is. By the way, you guys know what your powers are?" said Mijo.

"Uh, we do?! Lets see," said the girl before opening with a larger gun and a bayonet.

The boy also tried, getting a simple handgun.

"Oh cool, i don't know that!" said the girl.

"Hey guys, we should get going." said JR.

"Ok, then." said Mijo.

So the fountain is closing and then they all wake up, 5 PM. Damn it, they were way past over the afternoon class.

"Damn, well lucky chance, let's go home." said Mijo.

"Ay, well let's go." said Urda.

"Ok, everyone here, uh, don't talk, don't reveal, basically just don't talk about what happenned here. Ok? Ok. I'm, we are not helping you out if you do." said Mijo.

"Got it, no words coming out of this girl!" said Reeb.
 
"Uh sure!" said the girl before getting out of the room.

"Yeah, ok!" said the boy before also going out.

"Oh, I gotta go, see ya' Mijo, Urda, and Reebs!" said JR.

"Yeah, I'am going too! See ya Urda and Mijo!" said Reeb before also going out.

"Uh, i gotta go. I'll be seeing you, soon?" said Urda.

"Yeah, bye!" said Mijo.

SO they both went home, and not together, as Urda went out first. Mijo went last, making sure things were in order.

Author's Note: So, there ya go, but i really want to keep this going, but the fact that I'am not done with season 1 is kinda stressful and with school, oh man.. Anyways this one's
short, because this is the first time i wrote on a notebook instead of a phone's notes app. Hopefully i can have bigger one's in the future. Adios!

Summary: Starts off with a school story, ends with a dark world adventure. Like the old times right?
    
Mijo starts out, looking out of a balcony, near the classroom, as the Wednesday cleaners clean inside.
 
He wonders to himself, the past few weeks, he made a new friends, reconnected with old ones, and he's set with a potential research title approved. But all through it he still remembers
the dark world, even though a mishap happened during the first days of school, things slowed down and people focused on their schoolwork.
    
"Ah man, i wish i could do more but i've been busy and sick, all my friends are, well, busy too, I just wish that i had a chance, waitm can't I make my own dark worlds? I've been
inactive for this long!" as Mijo rants to himself, the Wednesday cleaners finish.
    
He decides to go down, because as he was ramblling to himself, the cleaners finished and went home.
    
The next day in school, he decides to think about it a little bit more, near his previous spot.

"Ok, so where exactly? Maybe the 9-Lit room? Like, where everybody is? But, I dont know what will happen, it could be bad, hmmm, maybe i could try during uwian, kasi it replicates the 
same situation as before and less people can ruin the secret, ok, thats-" Mijo got cut off by a new friend of him called Ikari.
    
"Dude, what have you been thinking of in the past hour? YOu just stood there and... What?" questioned Ikari.
    
"I have been thinking of plans, ok?" responded Mijo.

"Plans of what? World Domination?" said Ikari.
    
"No- something else secret, ok? Wait, actually, can you stay for a bit after dismissal?" said Mijo.
    
"Why- Oooh- You want me to help you in our AP Project? Well, the answer's no." said Ikari.
    
"Please? Para meron ka namang ambag-" said Mijo.
    
"Oo na nga, sige, sige." said Ikari.
    
Then JR suddenly appeared shouting "Papunta na si Ma'am!" they all quickly wbet inside the classroom.

After two classes, it was time for class dismissal, Mijo, Ikari and a bunch of groupmates all actually did the group project but as more people went out of the classroom and went home.
Mijo decided it was time.

"Ok guys, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the classroom and-" said Mijo.
    
"Oh yeah, I also will be doing that, come on, Mijo." said Ikari.

"Ok, then cool." said Mijo.

So, off they go towards the classroom of 9-Lit. They eventually made it with little conversation as they both ran to the classroom. Ikari was first though, Mijo was second.
    
"Hah- uou're second." said Ikari.
    
"Yeah, yeah, ok. Wait." said Mijo.

Then Mijo went to the middle of the classroom, got a ballpoint pen and stabbed the floor, filling the room with darkness.
    
"Yo, bro, what you doin' you just stabbed the floor and like dark air starts coming out?" said Ikari.
    
"Yeah, pretty much, now... wh- get prepared for the floor to dissapear." said Mijo.
    
"WHAT!? Bro, I'am getting the hell out of here, won't you too?" said Ikari.

"Its too late, the floor, is already collapsing..." said Mijo.
    
"Bro-" said Ikari before quickly hrabbing Mijo and quickly getting out of the classroom, but the floor already collapsed. Before both of them fell, they saw a dark sky with no sun or \
moon. Only black.
    
*Darkness Returns*

Ikari woke up in a dark place, only a platform and connecting ones filled the empty world.

"Ugh, that fucker, really put us in this dark- wait, isn't this like, what happened during the first days and accounts from Lauvielle? Shoot, I'am in a dark world." said Ikari.

"Well, dapat naman siguro, merong daanan dito, ay- yung mga weapons ko!" said Ikari.

Ikari managed to grab her full rifle with detachable sword in the bottom of the gun.

"Oh, maganda yan, full gun with a free sword." said Ikari, before moving throughout the floating platforms.

"I mean, dapat naman makita ko siya, kasi, at least sabi ni Lauvielle, naglalakad lang daw siya at nakikita na niya ang kaklase niya..." said Ikari.

After going through endless quizzes about school rules about drinking, smoking, bullying and more. She discovered a 2-story building with 5 rooms in each floor. A hallway allowed her to
navigate each room.

"Well, I have no choice, is either that, or through those stupid quizzes again. Ok, I can do this..." said Ikari before entering the building and opening the door of the nearest room 
closest to her.

"Hello, anyone there?" said Ikari, to no one in an empty, but organized room.

She moved on to the next one, and the next, no one was there. It looked like she entered after everybody went home. She went upstairs and checked all the rooms to the left of her, no 
one. She checked the nearest right one, no one, but when she checked the next one...

"Ugh, everybody there?" said Ikari, tired.

"Yeah, that's me..." said Mijo, also tired.

"Woah, what the fuck dude, i almost had a fuckin panic attack hearin' your ass..." said Ikari, surprised.

"You're lucky, by the way, when i landed here, there were a bunch of enemies, like really tough ones, like bottlemen, bullet-hell people, a lot of that type." said Mijo, while looking 
straight towards Ikari.

"Yeah, yeah... Hey, how did you open this... world, anyway, I though we were about to fuckin' die!" said Ikari.

"Look, If you heard it from Lauvielle, that means I have been here, before. However, it seems that I have been severely weakened by this world, so first time fighting for real." said 
Mijo.

"Ok... That was a lot of yapping, but ok, so you know how this world works? Cool, get me out of here, I wanna go home." said Ikari.

"No- like i know how they work, but this specific world? Only now, so you're gonna have to follow me." said Mijo.

"Hey! Well, I guess? I kinda wanna go off on my own." said Ikari.

"Well, if that's what you want, i also wanna explore and alone for the first time, too!" said Mijo.

"Ok, i guess I'll go to that city over there, have fun!" said Ikari, looking out of a window.

"Yep- you too." said Mijo.

So both went their separate ways, but-

"Hey, wait- how do we go there?" said Ikari.

"Brute Force." said Mijo, before slicing the wall in half and pushing it into the rubble below.

"Oh, ok. " said Ikari before going out the same hole, but going towards a different part of the city.

It was vast and overwhelming for Ikarim for even videogames can't prepare you for real, seeing a bunch of humanoid and monster-like beings walking around, though she would meet a
familiar, yet strange person.

"Hey! You're a... I mean- Are you with Mijo?" asked Jomi.

"Uh, used to, if you're lookin' for him, he's somewhere in the city, i dont know ehere but somewhere... to the right of me." said Ikari.

"Oh. jeez, ok. Uh so have you, like have you had magic-" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah, I alreay have them, the gun and- wait- who are you anyway? You seem to know Mijo, and you-" said Ikari.

"I look like him, i know, know. I'am Jomi, the princess of the dark. I... met him, with his friends, before." said Jomi.

"Oh, like, are you part of this world or are you with us?" said Ikari.

"I guess you can call me a part of this world, I'am a princess of dark after all." said Jomi.

"Nice, do you have an empire or a kingdom... or even a castle?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I have a castle, unfortunately, you haven't seen my largest one in... another world, but I have one here, for some reason." said Jomi.

"But, wait? I thought you lived here? Why would you have one somewhere else? Do you own multiple castles?" said Ikari.

"Yeah? Technically now, well, we should get going, we need to find him first, though, I can't let anyone stay here as the fountain closes." said Jomi.

"Ok, sure, got nothing i can do anyway, hey- are there any cell-" said Ikari.

"Cell service, none. You hear that? Sounds like music..." said Jomi.

"Should be a disco around here, oh hi. Jomi." said Mijo.

"Oh my- finally," Jomi runs up to Mijo and said "I have been looking for you in, hours!" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah- You're gonna serrmoon me about how irresponsible at mapanganib ang ginawa mo' at papauwi mo kami?" said Mijo.

"Well, yes. But like, don''t you wanna go home?" said Jomi.

Silence. Then Mijo said "No, NO! I... realized that through all of it, I enjoyed being a herom or just bonding with friends. School life's monotonous and boring." said Mijo.

"Ay, me too. But how do we get out of here? My dad's gonna be pissed..." said Ikari.

"Yeah, uh you have to help her, its like kind bad to trap her here. just go, we have to discuss this matter later." said Jomi.

"Ugh, fine. Only her, though. I wanna stay here." said Mijo.

"No- Mijo you don't understand"
