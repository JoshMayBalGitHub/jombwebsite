Summary: Starts off with a school story, ends with a dark world adventure. Like the old times right?

Author's Note: So, as of currently, the current pre-c3s2 stories have been merged due to me wanting a better story that also fits my current style, so if you were reading c2 it has been moved here, i am sure that you will enjoy this so see you soon, oh and the below is my previous author's note, i didn't have one for c2 btw.

So, there ya go, but i really want to keep this going, but the fact that I am not done with season 1 is kinda stressful and with school, oh man.. Anyways this one's short, because this is the first time i wrote on a notebook instead of a phone's notes app. Hopefully i can have bigger ones in the future. Adios!

It started off as a regular "first day of school". Old friends like JR and Lauvielle and new classmates for the rest of the year.

Now, Mijo and with 8-Clam, were retired from the whole "dark world" ever since they had their "last supper". Some of them were done with that type of adventure. Some moved out of the school, some got into bigger and better schools. The only ones still thinking about it were the first ones, Mijo and Urda. Now as "fate" would have it, they were separated.

As lunch time broke, JR and Mijo went to the railings near the classrooms, of course after eating their dinners.

"Hey JR, how's life?" said Mijo.

"It's bad, hahanapin ko yung ibang 8-Clam wanna join?" said JR.

"Yeah sure, hope no dark worlds open-" said Mijo before a big explosion was heard coming from the bottom floor, as they were on the 2nd floor.

"Ugh, let's go save another dark world." said Mijo.

"I mean, hinahanap natin yung 8-Clam diba?" said JR.

Both of them laughed before quickly going downstairs and seeing the room nearest to the bottom CR.

"Ok, let's see what section's here…" said Mijo.

"9-Oxir…" said JR.

"Ok, hmmm…" said Mijo, searching around the students until…

"Oh, that's why," said Mijo, pointing to Urda's full name.

"Ok, let's go in," said Mijo, before going in with JR.

"Wait Mijo-" said JR before cutting himself off.

They woke up in a desert, with Urda and her new friend which Mijo recognized but couldn't remember the name of.

"Hey! Urda and…" said Mijo before getting cut off by-

"Wow, bro, does not remember my name?!?" said Reeb.

"Oh yeah! You're Reeb from Grade 7! I forgor" said Mijo.

"Bruh… We used to play Micnaft in a server!" said Reeb.

"Hi Reebs!" said JR.

"Hi JR!" said Reeb.

"Guys, let's go to the main point, who opened this world, Urda, was it you?" said Mijo.

"Ok, it was me, but like, i was explaining the dark world to Reeb but she wouldn't believe, so I opened one!" said Urda.

"To be fair, di ko siya talaga paniniwalaan, I mean, a dark world that exists? Impossible!" said Reeb.

"Weel that, and i kinda wanted to see what would happen, i honestly expected you, Mijo." said Urda.

"Well, ok, lets just fix this situation, and go back. Lunch pa lang!" said Mijo.

"Then, we can go back?" said Urda.

"Yeah, yeah, just warn me next time." said Mijo.

"Hey guys, not to be anti climactic, but andoon lang yung fountain." said JR.

"Oh well lets go-" said Mijo before getting cut off.

Two people appeared, they looked like two people who Mijo seen before with Lauvielle on occasion.

"Great, more people." said Mijo.

"Lets just close the fountain and uh, forgot this happened." said Urda.

"Wait, yo, why does our phones not work?" said Reeb.

"Yeah, no cell towers here." said Mijo.

Then they went to the fountain and as they were about to close it,

"Hey, Reeb, what's your magic?" questioned Urda.

"Uh, let's see-" said Reeb, opening up a menu that looks like… Micnaft?!

"Oh cool, can you make a- wait Mijo!" said Urda.

"What? I'm closing it, oh yeah, the powers? sure, let's see it, Reeb!" said Mijo.

"OK, wash, isn't this op?!" said Reeb, placing diamonds down.

"Yeah, but i bet it will be like super costly or very strong but only on certain worlds, i know it all, well not all, but enough." said JR.

Then the two immediately met with the rest of the group.

"Hello, fellow people, you know how to get out of here?" said the girl.

"Hmm, wait isn't this what Lauvielle was saying about, like dark worlds or somethin!" said the boy.

"Oh yeah, and the fountain, so i'am guessing you guys know who Lauvielle is?" said the girl.

"Yeah, we, well most of us know who Lauvielle is. By the way, you guys know what your powers are?" said Mijo.

"Uh, we do?! Lets see," said the girl before opening with a larger gun and a bayonet.

The boy also tried, getting a simple handgun.

"Oh cool, i don't know that!" said the girl.

"Hey guys, we should get going." said JR.

"Ok, then." said Mijo.

So the fountain is closing and then they all wake up, 5 PM. Damn it, they were way past over the afternoon class.

"Damn, well lucky chance, let's go home." said Mijo.

"Ay, well let's go." said Urda.

"Ok, everyone here, uh, don't talk, don't reveal, basically just don't talk about what happenned here. Ok? Ok. I'm, we are not helping you out if you do." said Mijo.

"Got it, no words coming out of this girl!" said Reeb.

"Uh sure!" said the girl before getting out of the room.

"Yeah, ok!" said the boy before also going out.

"Oh, I gotta go, see ya' Mijo, Urda, and Reebs!" said JR.

"Yeah, I'am going too! See ya Urda and Mijo!" said Reeb before also going out.

"Uh, i gotta go. I'll be seeing you, soon?" said Urda.

"Yeah, bye!" said Mijo.

SO they both went home, and not together, as Urda went out first. Mijo went last, making sure things were in order.

The next day, Mijo starts out, looking out of a balcony, near the classroom, as the Wednesday cleaners clean inside.

He wonders to himself, the past few weeks, he made a new friends, reconnected with old ones, and he's set with a potential research title approved. But all through it he still remembers the dark world, even though a mishap happened during the first days of school, things slowed down and people focused on their schoolwork.

"Ah man, i wish i could do more but i've been busy and sick, all my friends are, well, busy too, I just wish that i had a chance, wait can't I make my own dark worlds? I've been inactive for this long!" as Mijo rants to himself, the Wednesday cleaners finish.

He decides to go down, because as he was ramblling to himself, the cleaners finished and went home.

The next day in school, he decides to think about it a little bit more, near his previous spot.

"Ok, so where exactly? Maybe the 9-Lit room? Like, where everybody is? But, I dont know what will happen, it could be bad, hmmm, maybe i could try during uwian, kasi it replicates the same situation as before and less people can ruin the secret, ok, thats-" Mijo got cut off by a new friend of him called Ikari.

"Dude, what are you doing in the past hour? You just stand there and… What?" questioned Ikari.

"I have been thinking of plans, ok?" responded Mijo.

"Plans of what? World Domination?" said Ikari.

"No- something else secret, ok? Wait, actually, can you stay for a bit after dismissal?" said Mijo.

"Why- Oooh- You want me to help you in our AP Project? Well, the answer's no." said Ikari.

"Please? So you have some ambag—" said Mijo.

"Oo na nga, sige, sige." said Ikari.

Then JR suddenly appeared shouting "Si Ma'am!" they all quickly went inside the classroom.

After two classes, it was time for class dismissal, Mijo, Ikari and a bunch of groupmates all actually did the group project but as more people went out of the classroom and went home. Mijo decided it was time.

"Ok guys, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the classroom and—" said Mijo.

"Oh yeah, I also will be doing that, come on, Mijo." said Ikari.

"Ok, then cool." said Mijo.

So, off they go towards the classroom of 9-Lit. They eventually made it with little conversation as they both ran to the classroom. Ikari was first though, Mijo was second.

"Hah- you're second." said Ikari.

"Yeah, yeah, ok. Wait." said Mijo.

Then Mijo went to the middle of the classroom, got a ballpoint pen and stabbed the floor, filling the room with darkness.

"Yo, bro, what you doin' you just stabbed the floor and like dark air starts coming out?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, pretty much, now… wh— get prepared for the floor to dissapear." said Mijo.

"WHAT!? Bro, I'am getting the hell out of here, won't you too?" said Ikari.

"Its too late, the floor, is already collapsing…" said Mijo.

"Bro—" said Ikari before quickly hrabbing Mijo and quickly getting out of the classroom, but the floor already collapsed. Before both of them fell, they saw a dark sky with no sun or
moon. Only black.

*Darkness Returns*

Ikari woke up in a dark place, only a platform and connecting ones filled the empty world.

"Ugh, that fucker, really put us in this dark- wait, isn't this like, what happened during the first days and accounts from Lauvielle? Shoot, I am in a dark world." said Ikari.

"Well, dapat naman siguro, merong daanan dito, ay- yung mga weapons ko!" said Ikari.

"Well, surely.. there must be a way— ay! my weapons!" said Ikari, now trying to find her weapon.

Ikari managed to grab her full rifle with detachable sword in the bottom of the gun.

"Oh, that's good, full gun with a free sword." said Ikari, before moving throughout the floating platforms.

"I mean, dapat naman makita ko siya, kasi, at least sabi ni Lauvielle, naglalakad lang daw siya at nakikita na niya ang kaklase niya…" said Ikari.

"I mean, I should still see him, kasi, at least for Lauvielle, ahe walked until she saw her classmates so..." said Ikari, thinking about her conversations with Lauvielle.

After going through endless quizzes about school rules about drinking, smoking, bullying and more. She discovered a 2-story building with 5 rooms in each floor. A hallway allowed her to navigate each room.

"Well, I have no choice, is either that, or through those stupid quizzes again. Ok, I can do this…" said Ikari before entering the building and opening the door of the nearest room closest to her.

"Hello, anyone there?" said Ikari, to no one in an empty, but organized room.

She moved on to the next one, and the next, no one was there. It looked like she entered after everybody went home. She went upstairs and checked all the rooms to the left of her, no one. She checked the nearest right one, no one, but when she checked the next one…

"Ugh, everybody there?" said Ikari, tired.

"Yeah, that's me…" said Mijo, also tired.

"Woah, what the fuck dude, i almost had a fuckin panic attack hearin' your ass…" said Ikari, surprised.

"You're lucky, by the way, when i landed here, there were a bunch of enemies, like really tough ones, like bottlemen, bullet-hell people, a lot of that type." said Mijo, while looking straight towards Ikari.

"Yeah, yeah… Hey, how did you open this… world, anyway, I though we were about to fuckin' die!" said Ikari.

"Look, If you heard it from Lauvielle, that means I have been here, before. However, it seems that I have been severely weakened by this world, so first time fighting for real." said Mijo.

"Ok… That was a lot of yapping, but ok, so you know how this world works? Cool, get me out of here, I wanna go home." said Ikari.

"No- like I know how they work, but this specific world? Only now, so you're gonna have to follow me." said Mijo.

"Hey! Well, I guess? I kinda wanna go off on my own." said Ikari.

"Well, if that's what you want, i also wanna explore and alone for the first time, too!" said Mijo.

"Ok, i guess I'll go to that city over there, have fun!" said Ikari, looking out of a window.

"Yep— you too." said Mijo.

So both went their separate ways, but—

"Hey, wait- how do we go there?" said Ikari.

"Brute Force." said Mijo, before slicing the wall in half and pushing it into the rubble below.

"Oh, ok. " said Ikari before going out the same hole, but going towards a different part of the city.

It was vast and overwhelming for Ikari for even videogames can't prepare you for real, seeing a bunch of humanoid and monster-like beings walking around, though she would meet a familiar, yet strange person.

"Hey! You're a… I mean— Are you with Mijo?" asked Jomi.

"Uh, used to, if you're lookin' for him, he's somewhere in the city, i dont know where but somewhere… to the right of me." said Ikari.

"Oh. jeez, ok. Uh so have you, like have you had magic-" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah, I already have them, the gun and— wait— who are you anyway? You seem to know Mijo, and you—" said Ikari.

"I look like him, i know, know. I am Jomi, the princess of the dark. I… met him, with his friends, before." said Jomi.

"Oh, like, are you part of this world or are you with us?" said Ikari.

"I guess you can call me a part of this world, I am a princess of dark after all." said Jomi.

"Nice, do you have an empire or a kingdom… or even a castle?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I have a castle, unfortunately, you haven't seen my largest one in… another world, but I have one here, for some reason." said Jomi.

"But, wait? I thought you lived here? Why would you have one somewhere else? Do you own multiple castles?" said Ikari.

"Yeah? Technically now, well, we should get going, we need to find him first, though, I can't let anyone stay here as the fountain closes." said Jomi.

"Ok, sure, got nothing i can do anyway, hey— are there any cell—" said Ikari.

"Cell service, none. You hear that? Sounds like music…" said Jomi.

"Should be a disco around here, oh hi. Jomi." said Mijo.

"Oh my— finally," Jomi runs up to Mijo and said "I have been looking for you in, hours!" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah- You're gonna serrmoon me about how irresponsible at mapanganib ang ginawa mo' at papauwi mo kami?" said Mijo.

"Yeah, yeah— You're gonna serrmoon me about how 'irresponsible and dangerous' I am and how you're sending us home no?" said Mijo, in a mocking tone, both a bit annoyed and angry.

"Well, yes. But like, don''t you wanna go home?" said Jomi.

*Silence.*

Then Mijo said "No, NO! I… realized that through all of it, I enjoyed being a hero or just bonding with friends. School life's monotonous and boring." said Mijo.

"Ay, me too. But how do we get out of here? My dad's gonna be pissed…" said Ikari.

"Yeah, uh you have to help her, its like kind bad to trap her here. just go, we have to discuss this matter later." said Jomi.

"Ugh, fine. Only her, though. I wanna stay here." said Mijo.

"No- Mijo you don't understand— You have to go with her. Now." said Jomi,

*Silence.*

Then after looking down and looking like he's about to contemplate his existence, sadly nodded and looked to Jomi, looking dejected and sad.

"..." then Jomi sighs, then says, "Ok, a deal's a deal. I promise, you can come back. Not now, but soon." then she quietly brings them to her castle in which the fountain is. As they stand before the fountain, Ikari speaks up.

"So... how does this work again?" questioned Ikari, looking at the fountain flow from the bottom to the sky above.

"I am sure you'll eventually know, but for now, hold that question." said Jomi, as she nudged Mijo to close the fountain. Then he gave his heart and light blinds everyone, afterwards both woke up at their respective seats.

"Ugh, oh.. It was a dream.. Just a dream..." said Ikari to herself as she looked around and saw Mijo next to her.

"Hey, hello? Uh—" said Ikari, before checking her phone and realizing it was time to go, got her things and woke up Mijo.

"Hey! How did you sleep like that? We just ran one mile, anyway, bye!" said Ikari before exiting out of class and going home.

As he watches Ikari exit, he also picks up his things and after that, closes the classroom, then he goes to the railings and looks to the school, contemplating that whole encounter. He decides to go home as well, as his dad finally arrives at the school.

For the next few months, he decides to follow Jomi's advice and go on about his life, making friends, suffering in school, etc. Ikari forgot about the whole thing, seeing it as a weird dream she had that one time, until one random conversation in breaktime happened...

"Sometimes, I wish there was a way of avoiding things here... or even resting! Honestly, with the work we get put under, how are we expected to last until Christmas!" ranted Ikari, as she was angry about something about the school.

"Yeah, I agree.." said Mijo, but then he thought to himself, "Wait, what about the dark world.. Does she remember? A good way to test that—"

"Hey dude, you okay? You suddenly looked like you were worried and thinking about something.." questioned Ikari, as she picked up her phone.

"Ah! Oh, sorry. Do you know who.. Jomi is?" said Mijo, looking at Ikari very seriously.

"Hmm, hmm, Nope! Sorry, but whoever that is, it sounds like a made-up name by parents who couldn't think of a way to combine names..." said Ikari, smiling as she also started to play a game on her phone.

"Right, I am going around, talk to you soon!" said Mijo, as he stood up and went to JR.

"Ok!" responded Ikari, as she now focused on the game on her phone, something about space trains.

"Hey JR and Lauvielle, what are y'all talking about?" said Mijo, looking at them.

"We were supposed to be talking about our research, but *she* got off-topic." said JR, staring at Lauvielle.

"Hey! We were.. Anyways, any new _tea_ for us?" said Lauvielle, now looking at Mijo with an excited look on her face.

"Nothing new, but an old one. The **_Dark World_.**" said Mijo, surprising the two of them.

"The dark world? Oh yeah!! That world where I was an arch mage that both heals and kills!" said JR, now excited about something ever since he got his new phone.

"Oh, yeah. The one where I had a bomb and a sword. Honestly, the only times where LV wasn't with me are the only good memories now.." said Lauvielle, feeling a mix of emotions; from being angry, sad and happy at the events before.

"Aww, I am sure you can get over him. Anyways, you can open one, right? Because I always wanted to go back, but I don't know how yet and I never got the chance to, and I didn't wanna ask you, since you probably changed your opinions ever since when Urda opened hers." said JR, telling his thoughts about the dark world.

"Yeah. I think I know the perfect place. Want to guess where?" said Mijo, smiling and putting his hands behind his back.

"The room?" guessed JR, thinking about suitable places.

"Not now, but good idea. But not now." responded Mijo, looking at the people in the classroom.

"The computer lab?" guessed Lauvielle, also thinking about suitable places.

"Close, which one?" questioned Mijo, now forming a big smile.

"*Gasp* WAIT, THE 2ND ONE?! The room next to us?!" said the both of them at the same time.

"Yep, let's go to it now. The room's unused and no one will notice." said Mijo, now looking towards the computer lab, contemplating something.

"Hey, wait, Isn't the room locked? How are we supposed to get in?" questioned Lauvielle, as she stood up with JR.

"Great question, luckily some chairs are being moved for some event, so lets use this opportunity to move in and I'll tell Jomi to make a key that can enter the computer lab and give it to you." said Mijo, pointing to JR as the key holder.

"Ohh right. The event... Anyways— lemme make sure my things are ok, we'll go near the door once we're done." said Lauvielle, as they both went to their bags to get something.

"Ok!" said Mijo, then as Lauvielle and JR focused on their bags, Mijo said to himself, "Now to get Ikari on board..." He went near Ikari's seat and sat down, looking at her then she looked at him.

"Ugh, I have been trying to get my research partners here, since we both have free time and yet they still haven't come.. Fucking seen-ers." ranted Ikari to Mijo as she checked her phone again.

Then at the door is Urda and Reeb, calling Ikari to go outside so they can talk.

"Wait, It's them? Perfect." thought Mijo, as he got lucky that almost all of the people know about the dark world, and that they wouldn't tell.

"Finally! Took you long enough!" shouted Ikari, as she went to them to talk about their robotic research.

"Hey! Mijo! Let's go." called JR to Mijo, as him and Lauvielle stood at the classroom door.

"Right, let's go." responded Mijo as he went to them and then all of them exited the classroom, then headed to the door of the computer lab.

"Computer Lab Two.." said Mijo, before going in with his friends. Then, they closed the room before he got his pencil then stabbed the ground giving rise to the darkness that eventually consumed the room.

"So, this is the prototype, of the robot that can save people from natural disasters. Okay? Now all we have to do is write some answers to some questions..." explained Ikari as Urda tunes her out looking behind her and seeing Mijo enter the computer lab two.

"He— Hey! Are you listening, Urda?" said Ikari, seeing Urda not paying attention.

"Oh, uh yes. Of course! So like we need to answer those so we can try to approve the title tomorrow?" said Urda, now focusing and looking at Ikari.

'Pretty much... Look, I'll just send some questions, and you can *answer* them, now go home or something, I don't care." said Ikari, as she went inside to pick up her bags.

"Hey, Urda, wanna go home?" questioned Reeb to Urda as she also looked at her.

"Uhhh, let's go inside the computer lab." answered Urda as she looked more closely at the lab.

"Oh? Ok!" said Reeb, then afterwards the both of them went closer to the lab.

"Woah, a dark world? Wait, how did— how did he make one and *not* produce a huge explosion?!" said Urda, as she looked inside and saw nothing but darkness.

"Well, what are we waiting for?? Let's go!" said Reeb before she went in.

"Ok, don't disappoint me, Mijo." said Urda, as she also went in.

"Wha— where are they?" said Ikari, before she looked to her left and saw Urda go into the lab.

"Huy! Wai— Huh? What the—" said Ikari as she ran to Urda and saw the inside of the lab.

"Heh? Wait, I... Uh, I feel deja vu... Hmph, she thinks that she can get away? I'll show her!" said Ikari, as she jumps in as well.

"Huh? What is this, eh? Wait! It feels familiar, I can't remember it though..." said Ikari to herself as she stood up from her fall. She notices a group of people talking about something.

"Eh? Those people, they.. hmm, I should approach them, but just in case.." said Ikari, before she prepared her gun, noticing that they looked familiar but radically different.

"Hey! I thought we had an agreement..? Like, it was implied that if one of us were to make a dark world, we would warn each other?" questioned Urda as they stood in a cyber platform.

"Hey! What's going on here? Where are we?!" said Ikari to the group.

"Uh, well first of all, I'm so sorry, Urda. I.. was about to but then I saw you were busy with your research, so I figured you'd know anyway. Uh speaking of that, uh Ikari, hmmm..." said Mijo as Urda nods and looks at Ikari.

"Oh, Ikari's here, uh why? Are you here.. wait. Did you make another one before this!?" said Urda as the group now turns their attention to Ikari and her question.

"Um, well yes— and uh Ikari! We.. are in a dark world, yeah, and it seems to be a CyberWorld that has elements of illusions or something based on the amount of enemies that seem to be dream-related." said Mijo as the group nodded.

"Oh, uh.. I remember now! Didn't we go on one, but Jomi kicked us out?" said Ikari, as the group stared at Mijo.

"Uhh guys! Calm down, um. Yeah like she said, we got sucked into one, and Jomi had to.. rescue us, yeah." said Mijo, as Ikari visibly doubts Mijo.

"Mijo, didn't you stab the ground..? Like sure we got sucked in, but you started it." said Ikari, as the group collectively questioned Mijo, a bunch of voices started piling up until...

"Hold on, hold! One at a time please! Yes, i did do it, I regretted it ok? Jomi explained why.. Anywho, as for the deal, yes I also forgot about that so SORRY!" said Mijo, before he walked away, visibly shaken and almost crying.

"Um.. Huh. So, what do we do then?" said Ikari, as the group is silent.

"We.. should discuss other things, I know him, he uh.. he tends to calm down after a while.. So. this dark world, I think I know what this one is based off, it's..." said Urda, trying to keep the group together.

Meanwhile at Mijo and his thoughts; near the group but far away so that the group's voices are unintelligible.

"I.. don't know why I burst out like that.. Is my development wasted? or I just.. forgot? I don't know anymore... I have to recollect my thoughts and feelings, right now. Before... this world, it seems good on the outside but it looks like the type that would easily manipulate vulnerabilities sneakily. So—" 

"Hey, uh you good? Because we are going now." said Ikari, as Mijo turns around and sees Urda waving hello.

"Y-yeah.. Sure. Um, sorry about that. I am sure the group has filled you in the details right?" said Mijo as Ikari and him walked to the group.

"Yeah, so uh what you missed is... that the world seems nice but is actually bad on the inside, that was the conclusion of Urda and the others, I mean I don't know, I've only been in one and well... you know.." said Ikari, as they walked with the group to the city ahead.

"Yeah, that makes sense. Anyways, we should see what's happening, they have stopped walking.." said Mijo as the group was staring at somebody.

"Hello, lightners! I see that you have come bearing your arms and are on the way to the dark fountain, hmm? Well just so you know, I, the queen will stop you!" said the person that called themselves 'queen'.

"Uh, what's your actual name though? I want to know for archive purposes.." said Mijo as the group stared at disbelief.

"Oh? So you want my full name?? Well my full name is 81LK00HDUS, as I am a computer.. obviously." said the queen, as the group collectively lost their minds.

"Ya know what, this sounds familiar, but I will decide to call you... Lukara, yep. That's the one, I'm just going to write that down..." said Mijo, as the group calmed down.

"Uh, so are you gonna fight us... or?" said Urda as Lukara now looks at Urda.

"Noope! Why would I waste time here, come on trailblazers, there is much of the city, enjoy while it lasts! Oh and have fun with my minions, see ya!" said Lukara before she left and left her minions,  to deal with the lightners.

"Did she just call us trail—" said Ikari, before the battle started with the minions.

"What are they called anyway?? If It's a stupid name, like prammes or progs, I am going to stab the nearest darkner here.." said Lauvielle as JR shields them from incoming damage.

"Hehe, Ikari! You're up. Kill those for us!" said Urda as Ikari gets pushed to the front of the group.

"Ah! What— Hey! Um, I have a gun. That might work—" said Ikari, before shooting it accidentally on a minion damaging it slightly.

"Girl, you are not used to wielding a gun, here imma help you!" said Urda as Reeb decided to intervene in place of Ikari, shooting her crossbows towards the minions, killing them.

"Oh, I thought this was my kill, but whatever, I still need to figure out how this thing works.." said Ikari before Urda started teaching her how to wield a gun as the group moved.

Summary: Broken hearts and feelings, make way for the new era. Things change, and these adventurers have to now face it.

Author's Note: As you can probably tell, I moved the current c2s2 arc to c1s2 because one, i thought that the first one was too short, and two, I've always wanted a bigger story between c2 and c3, seeing as I made them in-story about half a year long so a lot of things should had happened and this chapter is for that, and so this is also a w.i.p. so watch out and see you when i see you, bye!

An alarm is ringing as Mijo awakes to another distressing day...

"Ah shi— Ugh, I swear every time I wake up.. I— hold on, I should probably rush." said Mijo as he goes and prepares his stuff then goes to school.

"Bye-bye dad!" said Mijo to his dad, named June. His dad silently waves as both of them separate for the day. He got his bag down, then went straight for the dark world, now situated at the ever always empty computer lab.

"I.. do not know how to express it, but ever since our 'separation'.. I just felt empty..? Look I know that I have Ikari, I know I still have the others, it's just that.. fun with her." said Mijo, as he talked to Jomi, now his part-time therapist for some reason.

"Mhm, are you still.. not over with.. _Rhida?"_ questioned Jomi, now looking over the training field.

"He— Hu— Uh.. I do not know... My feelings remain conflicted as it did the last time we met.. I honestly do not know, I've been thinking about it.." said Mijo as they sat in a royal hangout place.

"This isn't your usual place, Mijo. I thought you would be.. playing outside?" said Jomi, now looking at Mijo.

"Uh, I just don't feel good today, after the last one yesterday, things have calmed down, and they have been focusing on the domains you made, I said to them that I'll be resting for today, and find me at Jomi's if needed. Also, choice of words, there Jomi." explained Mijo, as he looked at the training field, where JR and Lauvielle are seen talking about something, Ikari about to enter another domain, and Urda and Rhida talking near a domain entrance.

"Don't feel good..? Hmm, that's weird, don't you usually rest after dark worlds, like the other ones, even if it's for.. example, like a PT, because you would and could do them, since you said yourself after that massive battle, it caused you to have to take a break from normal activity and rest for 3 days, like a sick person." said Jomi, now thinking over some books.

"Yeah, I guess, it's about this, and that dreaded coming of the mass demo where there are 3 potential things we have to practice over a month." said Mijo as he lays down on the couch.

"Good luck, I heard that it was hard before, I guess yearly pains?" said Jomi, now picking up a RoyalCo Drink.

"Yes, they haven't even started yet, and they're probably gonna rush through two weeks again. I honestly do not know what to do about that too, ugh everything is tiring..." ranted Mijo, as Jomi looks at Mijo.

"Your life is.. very hard no? You always have to expect the unexpected in the dark worlds as well as deal with the usual stress that comes in being a high schooler.. Huh, I guess that does make life interesting but—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupts.

"—it sure is better than any other option, like imagine if I was so done with my life that I made like a novel that is just this?" said Mijo, unintentionally breaking the fourth wall.

"Well, if you did, are you sure it'll be as unexpected and sudden as this is?" said Jomi, continuing the topic.

"Yeah! Well, I am writing a.. like a diary of this world so—" said Mijo before realizing something.

"Well, you're looking at her. Let's go back to the topic, since you're clearly distracting yourself with novels to cope with the current events. Let's start at Rhida, because.. that's the first one you came to me about." said Jomi, as she pours more RoyalCo.

"Uh, yeah sure... I just... *exasperated sigh* I.. don't.. know?! Ok, like there's this weird dynamic where like every time we look at each other, one of us quickly looks away.. It's weird! And I don't know what to make of it! Like, just like a couple of months after and.. we can't even look at each other?!" said Mijo, feeling lost and confused.

"I.. see. Hmm, well I know this sounds _cliché_ but, like go to her? Seriously.. there's no possible way to get this off your mind, especially here, since she and I collaborated on the domains, so take your chances while it's hot!" said Jomi, as she takes a sip of RoyalCo.

"Mmm... About that. See, there's this feeling, that I can't brush off, what will be her reaction? Will she avoid me? I also have been friends with Ikari, for a while now. And I can't just— ugh... You're supposed to be the more caring, logical side.. Yet, as powerful or even as smart as I can be, I still suck at these parts..." said Mijo, as he takes a cup and pours one RoyalCo for himself.

"Well, there's no better way. I mean, at least you have a conclusion if you gauge what she feels..." said Jomi, as she finished her cup.

"I.. ok, um.. As for the others, I have.. to think about it, but I am energized again. Thanks, Jomi." said Mijo, as he finished his cup, and got up from his chair.

"You're welcome. Go now. I still have a bit more time to myself." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and left.

" *big sigh* All of them.. They have so many problems.. Not even a magical place can take away the problems of their lives.. In fact, it just adds more, but.. *turns to Urda and Mijo talking, with Lauvielle and JR joining in* at least, they're having fun." said Jomi to herself, as she drank a lot of RoyalCo. Then as she pours herself another one, someone knocks at the door.

"Hey..? This is Rhida, can I come in?" said Rhida from outside the door, before Jomi noticed and opened. "Hey~" said Jomi, as they went into the room, and she closed the door.

"So.. what brings you here..? The domains..? or just to talk?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida sits down on the same chair that Mijo was on.

"Haha.. The domains are actually going fine.. But, real talk, sis. You know who." answered Rhida, as Jomi pours a RoyalCo into her cup. "You want?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida politely asked for water instead.

"So.. Mmm.. What, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as she poured Rhida a cup of water. "Um.. I already spoke to some of my friends, but since you're so close to him, and well, you're a friend too, I just wanted to ask.. Is.. he avoiding me?" questioned Rhida, as she drinks the cup of water.

Jomi makes a big sigh at this question and Rhida quickly adds, "Um.. I know how bad it sounds, but you can understand me, right? As you said.. *stops* *exasperated sigh*  to talk to you if I have any problems, and.. I think this is important."

She stops, stares at Mijo and Urda then turns to Rhida, staring seriously, before she says, "He.. is.. mm... not avoiding you.", after carefully saying these words, she stares out again, drinking a shot of RoyalCo.

"R—really? But.. mmm.. it's weird, after the big battle and our moving up, he just seems to avoid me.. Every time I look vaguely in his direction, even when he was with JR earlier..." said Rhida, as Jomi sits down in front of her. Rhida continues, "Although, it's not like he's actively walking away, but.. he'll coincidentally be looking at something else or doing something just as I look at him, I find that.. disappointing."

"I'm sure he feels the same way too.. It's just, none of you express it well." said Jomi, as she sits down. "Oh.." Rhida trails off, her mind swirling with thoughts. "It's just something I've observed, don't take it like it's an.. insult or anything, I just.. want to help you with him." adds Jomi, drinking another shot of RoyalCo.

Rhida stays silent, the room tensing up a bit. "I.. understand.. You're supposed to be the third party that is observing from a distance, so any.. biases and emotions are off." Rhida sighs as she poured and drank more water. "Well.. can't say that I am not biased, nor do I not have emotions at play.. But, I am just giving what I think, as a good companion to both of you." Jomi gets another bigger glass and pours more RoyalCo. "This.. softdrink, it's calming." Jomi drank it all. "Sometimes, that can mean **I can** be conflicted even though there's a clear wrong or right."

"I.. understand. I am just happy that you're here for us, and the rest of the group. Even with all your past trauma." said Rhida, as she drank more water. "Thank you for understanding." Jomi drinks more RoyalCo.

<p id="C3"><md-block># C3 DeltaRambles: The New Intramurals</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Summary: After the school announced the second intramurals in a year, Mijo came up with a new way of using sports through the dark world's magic but unexpected events happen and he and his friends fall to another dark world...

Author's Note: Not sure yet, where to put this but it's definitely late game. Also just a little bit inspired by real life events, just a little.

An alarm is ringing as Mijo realizes that he's almost definitely gonna be late...

"Shi- not again..." said Mijo as he quickly tried to rush his morning school routine.

He tried to, but in the end, he was late by a couple of minutes, as he heard the flag raising ceremony happen, he knew he was late but had to go somewhere. After moving through the hallway and towards the stairway leading up to his classroom, he puts his bags at his seat then quickly dashes to the computer laboratory next to his classroom. As it was unused, this had been where they set up the dark world.

"Ok, I'm here, let's see if it's open." said Mijo as he looked inside the glass door.

"Yep, ok let's go." said Mijo as he jumped in and  landed in a cyber city, full of computers and there he met Jomi.

"Hi! Jomi, i was a little bit late, sorry!" said Mijo.

"I.. expected that, but still.. you _should_ have gone here a bit earlier like 6:30?" said Jomi.

"Right, sorry again, you know.. parents, and me not sleeping-" said Mijo.

"-at the right time, yes, you should have known to not sleep at 3, isn't that right?" said Jomi.

"Ye- Yeah... Look, i want to discuss with you, the plan i was saying last week.." said Mijo.

"Oh? Ok. What is it, you also said you were bringing your friends..." said Jomi.

"Oh! They must be finishing up, i might need them, i will come back very soon, wait here, ok?" said Mijo.

"Fine. But seriously plan everything, if you keep getting overwhelmed like this..." said Jomi.

"Yeah.. yeah.." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"Ah ok, so it should be- ah crap, I am probably absent because of the whole protection of the dark thing, so uh.. Hmm what are they doing there anyway..." said Mijo.

"So any more announcements? No? Well you all can go back to your classrooms now!" said the person at the stage with a mic.

"Oh no, if they see me... They would have known I didn't attend.. shit! Uh uh, aha! I just have to.. message them at the gc... Right, how could i forget about that, anyways.." said Mijo as he opens his phone and types:

Mijo: @everyone, so uh i am not absent, i just didn't attend the FRC, but the reason is we have a group meeting in the dark world. Anyone available can join, thank you all!!!

"Ok that should, be good. Now it's time to explain to Jomi why they aren't here yet." said Mijo.

Mijo jumps in again then meets Jomi.

"Hey..." said Mijo.

"And where's your friends, hmm?" said Jomi.

"Uhh, they're on their way... Hopefully." said Mijo.

"Hopefully? Sure. But have you actually formulated anything about any plan regarding.. whatever you're thinking about, or you came here to ask me..?" said Jomi.

"Ehe~ yep. I.. I have a plan, just an incomplete one..." said Mijo.

"Oh? Then what is it?" said Jomi.

"Ok, so i got the idea when, they announced the intramurals for this week, and I wanted to replicate that but in the dark world, but I don't know where to start, as there are a lot of factors that i think you can only answer." said Mijo.

"Interesting. What about your friends, besides being the competitors, i assume..?" said Jomi.

"Oh yeah, exactly what you're thinking. Some of them competitors, some facilitators, they choose." said Mijo.

"Hmm, how many? You know i have to make room, food, utilities, and other materials for the sports and.. that takes time." said Jomi.

"Hmm, right now, about only 60 people know of a dark world and have been in one, and most of them are my friends. So that? Though, i want more." said Mijo.

"Well, how many? I think we can still fit those.. 'guaranteed' people, even with extra stuff." said Jomi.

"Hehe, now that's a problem because... I don't know how many, because i want to ask-" said Mijo.

Then suddenly behind them, a bunch of people appeared; JR, Lauvielle, and Ikari.

"He- Hey, Mijo! I.. just came here and.. what is it you wanted to meet about.." said JR, exhausted.

"Yeah, i had to catch up, as _JR_ was running..." said Lauvielle.

"Oh yeah, don't forget about me! I had to run as well!" said Ikari.

"I.. probably shouldn't have rushed you guys, but-" said Mijo.

"It's about the intramurals, i take it you all would have heard about it?" said Jomi

"Yeah, but why? What did you want to ask that relates here?" questioned Ikari.

"So, I want to make the intramurals but here, in the dark world." said Mijo.

"Huh? Now, uh you got a plan for that, Mijo?" said Ikari.

"Hehe, now... That's why y'all are here..." said Mijo.

"Now, that idea looks fun! Mijo, but uh we need a break... Some of them also should arrive like... Leviente... Or Rhida? I don't know dude..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh can we go to your CPU castle, Jomi?" said JR.

"Sure. We'll continue it there, I have some tables and chairs set up already. You all go ahead without us, I have a word to speak to Mijo..." said Jomi.

"Ok!" said Lauvielle, Ikari, and RJ as they head to the castle, walking.

"Ok now you, Mijo, 'Plan'?" said Jomi.

"Uh what do-" said Mijo.

"I said a word to you, now i will speak words instead." said Jomi.

"Jomi!? Let's get serious, please?" said Mijo.

"Yeah yeah, so about that participants thing, how?" said Jomi.

"I.. will find a way." said Mijo.

"Don't tell me you are making a dark world in the gymnasium!" said Jomi.

"Well, that was one, but-" said Mijo.

"But? You know there's a reason why you made it a whole secret and there's magic involved-" said Jomi as they pass the castle's gates.

 "Yeah, yeah, that's stupid. But, what room can i even use, it's not like i can keep making it here, in cyber city. I have to find a perfect spot, somewhere around the school..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, now I don't know, but you'll have to see for yourself. Anyways, we're here." said Jomi.

"Wow, you- you changed a lot in the castle ever since making this my main dark world...." said Mijo.

"Yeah, yeah. Though i have noticed the amount of darkners that are 'visitors' from another land have increased..." said Jomi.

"Hmm, is it anything to do with the increase of students in the computer lab?" said Mijo.

"Probably, I don't mind it, they're usually fine people. I was just curious. Anyways we should head inside." said Jomi.

"A'ight.." said Mijo.

They headed inside to see the others talking at the table.

"I always wondered why it was so fast to go from there to here..." said Mijo.

"Magic, well- more like my castle is just really close to the destination." said Jomi.

"Wait, then like, how do you respond to the visitors?" said Mijo.

"Oh, well.. notice how we passed by the gate while we're talking?" said Jomi.

"There was a gate..? Sorry, Jomi, i just tend to miss some things..." said Mijo.

"I noticed. Anyway, that's closed when I order it to be closed so the visitors would have to go around to the city first." said Jomi.

"Oh ok.. uh hey let's greet them!" said Mijo.

"Hi! Mijo! We were just talking about random stuff." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, like how Lauvielle keeps yapping about Leviente's neck pillow..." said Ikari.

"Hey! I- It's important!" said Lauvielle, a bit flustered.

"So what did you want to talk about Mijo?" said JR.

"Uh, so about here, it's something to do with the intramurals." said Mijo.

"Like the one announced earlier and in the gc?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, like that but here, with magic and cool shit." said Mijo.

"Ah, ok. Uhm, so how?" said JR.

"Hehe, now that's the thing, I don't know!!" said Mijo.

"Ugh..." said Jomi as she facepalms. "We have already discussed some parts, he said he wants you guys to be either facilitators or players." said Jomi again.

"Can it be both?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, Mijo! Answer the question." said Jomi.

"Uh, yeah! As long as someone else is also facilitating." said Mijo.

"So, we have two per.. game. Hmmph, we need more people." said Jomi.

"Hmm, can we ask our other classmates? From our section?" said JR.

"Yeah! I'm planning on accommodating a lot of people. Hmm how many are in the dark world gc?" said Mijo.

"Uh, I don't remember, and we can't check it here..." said Ikari.

"Oh no... Well we have to go back but we might get spotted..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, aren't the grade 7's finally using this room, Mijo?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Right. Um, wait, when do they go here?" Said Mijo.

"Uh, we should go right now, because they can arrive anytime and discover this.. and I do not trust those *children*." said JR.

"But- ugh, fine. Let's go, we can talk about this after school. Y'all have like, delayed pick up driver?" said Mijo.

"I do, but i know that JR usually goes early and it's Monday so..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh- i was gonna say in the gc, but we haven't even informed the rest of them that we have a plan now.." said JR.

"Yep, um, i guess we'll be here uh.. Mijo! You inform JR of our agreements later ok?" said Ikari.

"Got it, let's just—" said Mijo.

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of monsters from the abyss start pounding on the castle's gates. It can be heard all the way to the inside of the castle.

"Ugh, abyss monsters. I don't know why or how they're here but they have raised their activity a lot these past few weeks." said Jomi.

"Well, uh we'll see then hehe, we have to go back so let's kill those monsters!" said Mijo.

"Yeah!" said everybody else.

So all of them headed out of the castle and Jomi decided to open the gates, by saying "Open the gates! Execution Mode!" as some darkners came to fight the monsters.

"What is it, your highness?" said a darkner.

"Kill these abyss monsters, right now." said Jomi.

"Yes, your highness, we shall." said a darkner as they charged into battle.

"Damn, you got an entire army and you're a leader? You have a lot of subjects now." said Mijo.

"Yep, you better go, don't waste our manpower here." said Jomi.

"Ok guys, let's go!" said Mijo before his group attacked the monsters left and right. The group moved through waves of abyss attack, for some reason, more than they had anticipated but they arrived at the light tunnel.

"Ok, that was a bit much. Where did they all come from???" said Ikari.

"The abyss, duh." said Lauvielle.

"Hey—" said Ikari.

"Wait, yeah but more and more the monsters are increasing in their attacks... There might be a catalyst outsider. Just, watch out, all of you." said Jomi.

"Ok, well guys let's-" said Mijo as the others went up.

"Rude. Anyways, bye Jomi! See you later!" said Mijo as he went up.

"Something might happen during the next few days, but I am not sure what it is, before they arrive, I must investigate myself." said Jomi as she goes back into battle.

"Hey guys!" said Mijo as he meets his friends, waiting for him.

"You're here, let's go. It's lunch so we have our school time cut in half." said JR.

"That's nice, well let's eat," said Mijo as he looked to his back, seeing the normal computer lab.

"Yep, let's go." said JR as all of them went their separate ways of eating lunch.

"Anyways, the amount of monsters is interesting, to say the least. But I have to eat so let's think about that later." whispered Mijo to himself as he went and got his food.

"Oh nice, dry chicken with rice and cut hotdog. Hmm, you know, if i only didn't prioritize eating as fast as possible i would have disliked this and the variety too. Anyways, I am just gonna eat now." said Mijo to himself as he looks at this food as he prepares it.

He eats food and after a while, he finishes and pulls out his diary that he doesn't call a diary.

"Alright, so abyss monsters, hmm what type though... Ooh! I saw one that has scythes, what else...  Hmm, i saw one that was just a big guy with an axe... Ok, ano pa ba... Aha! I know! It looks like a two legged beast that has arms that shoot fireballs, or i think it was just rockets... Well, that should be some of the enemies i encountered there.." said Mijo again, to himself as he writes it all down on his diary / notebook / whatever he calls it.

"Hey, Mijo, whatcha doing there.." said Ikari.

"Oh just, writing. Um... why?" said Mijo.

"Oh, nothing. Just bored. Anywho, i know you didn't attend the morning classes, that's why i got us a *Reviewer*." said Ikari.

"You want us, to review? I mean, if there were quizzes we could just—" said Mijo.

Then outside the classroom, a bunch of grade 7's are approaching the computer lab in a line, and all slowly go inside.

"—go into the dark world..." said Mijo as he realized something.

"Yeah, no, it's not an option anymore... Well, you said you could make dark worlds, soo why not here..?" said Ikari.

"Hmm, that's a last resort, also, I.. just don't want more people knowing about it..." said Mijo.

"Ok, well we better review or you might have to forego your secret haha.." said Ikari.

"Hehe, yeah. Let's do it." said Mijo as he put away his 'notebook'.

As they reviewed, eventually time passes and it's time for class. First they had a quiz, and then another quiz. After that, the class was dismissed.

"Goodbye, mam Sant!" said everyone as the teacher left the classroom.

"Ok, Mijo this is our opportunity, see ya on the flip side!" said Ikari as she quickly rushed through the barely functioning classroom door and to the computer lab.

"Wait!" shouted Mijo then said to himself; "Hmm, when i went out, the dark world was gone so if she—"

"Hey, Mijo! Come here!" shouted Ikari as she stands near the door looking at him.

"Yeah! Coming!" shouted Mijo back as he also went out of the barely functioning door to Ikari.

"When are we gonna fix that... Anywho, let me guess—" said Mijo.

"The dark world's gone!" said Ikari, with a worried expression.

"That, um, so— like, the dark world's not gone, but we have to do something to make it appear again." said Mijo.

"Really? But, it's closed... It's locked." said Ikari.

"Wha— oh that makes sense. But, we could just break inside?" said Mijo.

"Sure... But how..?" said Ikari.

*Lauvielle joined the conversation*

"Hey guys, I thought we were going to the dark world, what are you guys still here for?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Um, the dark world's gone..." said Mijo.

"WHAT?! How are we supposed to go in then?" said Lauvielle.

"I don't know!! That's why I'm asking him!" said Ikari.

"Hey, I got this, ok? Just, we need to gain access to the room..." said Mijo.

"How..? That's why we're tryna have a discussion, because—" said Ikari.

"—we don't have any way. Yeah. I know." said Mijo as he looks and sees Sir Joriec and his key to the computer lab. "I think we have an opportunity though..." said Mijo.

"Si sir Joriec?!" said Lauvielle, surprised about seeing Sir Joriec.

"Hi, Lauvielle, Cala, nice to meet you again. We're here just to clean up the computer lab." said Sir Joriec as he goes to the computer lab and unlocks it.

"Hey, Mijo, this is our chance... Let's go right now!!" said Ikari to Mijo secretly.

"Hold on, do we include them? Because, you know..." said Mijo back.

"Hey!! What are you guys talking about, i got... distracted..." said Lauvielle, clearly still shocked by the appearance of the teacher.

"Oh, umm, let's go to the dark world now, Mijo! Use your 'magic method', hehe." said Ikari, with  a sarcastic tone.

"Alright, hold on, they should be—" Mijo said, before getting interrupted by a voice nearby.

"Hey! Is sir Joriec there? Mam Sant is asking me to call him..." said Isatac.

"Yeah," said Lauvielle as she looked into the computer lab and said to Sir Joriec, "Hello po, you are being called by Mam Sant..."

"Ay, Sure. I'll go outside right away!" expressed Sir as he went outside and went with the student to go talk to Mam Sant.

"Good, that's our opportunity! Let's go inside then, Mijo, you will create the dark world." said Ikari before she went inside the room.

"Hey! Wait up!" shouted Mijo, as he tried to grab Ikari by the shoulder making her stop by the door. "I don't think creating a dark world with this many people, is a great idea." he continued.

"Oh, now _you_ don't want more people finding out, how are we supposed to invite people then?!" argued Ikari, as she angrily got in.

"Guys, Sir Joriec is coming back here! We need to go there right now. I can talk our way out of this, just make the world already!" said Lauvielle to both of them as she went outside and looked for potential witnesses.

But then suddenly a huge explosion was heard, and a bunch of other smaller ones as well, it was heard around the school.

"What is happening?!" said Ikari, panicking over the supposed destruction going on.

"Uh oh, we need to go in right now! Jomi might need our help!" said Jomi, reassuring Ikari, as he prepared to stab the ground.

"Mijo!! The world's collapsing, again! So many fountains..." shouted Lauvielle from the door as  she looked towards the balcony.

"Alright, let's beat some abyss monsters." said Mijo as he stabbed the ground and recreated the dark world. 

Suddenly, a blinding white light started to blind the three of them and since the door wasn't closed, it connected with the other worlds which were made with connecting them all in mind. Mijo woke up near the place where Jomi usually meets him, but he saw a battlefield instead.

"Ay putakte, there's so many monsters... I thought Jomi got it..." said Mijo as he looked upon the razed grounds of Jomi's Castle.

Then Jomi appeared, knocking back abyss monsters with her signature pink lightning cut, then slashing a big monster through the middle, then quickly dashing to Mijo.

"Hey, you have come at the worst time! The abyss just started a massive attack and I have been trying to suppress them here, what's the situation at the light?" said Jomi as she attacked a bunch of abyss monsters going towards her and Mijo.

"It's bad!! Its super duper bad!!" said Ikari, only just waking up.

"Woah! didn't notice you there. Yeah, I think a bunch of dark worlds also opened..." answered Mijo, shocked at Ikari as he didn't notice her waking up.

"What?! Hold on, really?" said Jomi, shocked at Mijo's answer.

"Yeah, we got here because of that, and uh we were supposed to be here for the—" said Mijo before being interrupted by Jomi. "Yeah, yeah, the intramurals... Let's deal with these monsters first, ok? Also, i thought Lauvielle was supposed to be here..."

"She technically didn't enter, and since the outside was also being filled..." Mijo thinks, then says, "She must be around here, since she wasn't where we were, oh yeah, my entire school probably is here..."

"Oh no, I fear that they have executed their plan very well, we need to stop them." said Jomi, thinking about her investigation earlier.

"Well, then let's goo!! We have to find other people anyway..." said Ikari, worried about her friend's wellbeing.

"I.. have to go stop them, you all look for your lightner friends, me and my army will march straight to their base at the heart of the abyss." said Jomi before she left them to go to the abyss base.

"Whaa— Really? Now how do we do that??" panicked Mijo, as once again, the world is in his hands.

"We're fucked duuude.." said Ikari as she sits down again.

"Now again, we can't give up. Ugh, we can't save everyone, but we can *try* to. Are you following me?" said Mijo, resolute, yet tired.

"Mmmm ok, I.. have nothing to do here anyway, if the world's ending, i _gotta_ enjoy it with my friends..." said Ikari, as she stands up, then says, "Ok, I'm following you now." 

"Alright, we have a deal. Let's go look for Lauvielle, she should be here, on the way, let's kill some monsters, then." said Mijo, then he unsheathed his sword.

"Uh, sure. Lemme just get my gun out." then she pulls out an unknown bolt-action rifle. "Hey, wait why does my weapon always change when I go here, meanwhile that's the same sword I saw back then??" 

"Well, I don't know, I guess you just haven't figured out what you truly want as a weapon.. But that's fine. I'm sure you'll learn quickly, we should go save Lauvielle as soon as possible." reassured Mijo, looking at the gun very intently before looking at Ikari.

"Yeah, hmm let me try it out on these enemies," as she guns down 3 enemies in 3 seconds behind Mijo. "Woah! You're right!"

"Hmmph, they are interrupting this rescue mission, hold on." Mijo then sheathes his sword again then suddenly starts slashing all around the monsters around like a bubble around the field. Then suddenly glass shatters around him as he appears again, with his sword unsheathed again.

"WHAT?! Why do you have that and i have.. this?! Stop, please stop flexing on me already!!" Ikari, surprised about the events that just transpired.

"Eh? I mean, you could try yours, let's see it!" said Mijo, again reassuring her.

"Uh sure," as she focuses, a bunch of monsters appear again, Mijo moves behind Ikari to see what she does then she says, "Guns away!" as she perfectly executes an execution of all the monsters in 5 seconds, decimating all of them.

"That.. was a bit exhilarating, but I.. feel fine, except for the fact that I am a bit tired right now." said Ikari, feeling exhausted but she can still stand up.

"Now, that's what we call a magic burst! Damn you did that first try— I mean second try so that's good!" said Mijo, complimenting Ikari's skills again.

"Second try? Heh, you got defeated that first time so you would definitely remember, haha."
answered Ikari, as she sits down on the ground.

"Guys! Over there! Some survivors!" a voice rang out from the left of them, they seem to be lightners as well, likely about the same grade level as them.

"Huh?! Sino kayo?!" questioned Mijo, as he was surprised about the lightners.

"Ah! I— It's you!" said the person in front of them as they called into their group, "Urda!"

"Huh, Urda..?" said Mijo as he looks into the group as a figure is going to the front

"Yep! It's me!" shouted Urda excitedly as everybody lowered their guard.

"Hey~ Its been a long time, speaking like this... I wish it wasn't these days that we do..." said Mijo.

"Yeah, I agree. Honestly, I have been getting to know my section a lot and... it was thanks to you that i got here in the first place.." replied Urda.

"Ah don't worry about it, anywho... We still need to find out what's happening and how to stop this whole mess, I figured you know something about this?" said Mijo, getting back to the point of their meeting.

"I mean... last chance to talk before apocalypse is nice... But yeah, I am wondering where's your section cause' as soon as the sky was turning dark and an explosion happened, I immediately rushed and gathered all of 'em before getting fully dropped in.." said Urda, with a bit of questions for Mijo as well.

"I.. wasn't prepared for that—"

"No shit sherlock, yeah, how do you have a plan for this?! I mean, a catastrophe like this has never happened before, right?!" said Ikari, cutting off Mijo and being a bit loud at the same time.

"Well, actually—"

"Are you about to tell me that you have gone through _this_ before and haven't had a backup plan?" questioned Ikari.

"Alright, calm down. Yeah— Mine was an on the field decision either... So, it isn't his fault, since we did win last time, but— well looks like we have to go searching for the answers again..." explained Urda.

"By the way, have your friends have been fighting the abyss monsters the entire time?" questioned Mijo as he saw the background of a mix of people battling some abyss monsters.

"Uh yeah, why did you think I had the time to talk to you two? Well we better go, we might find some clues along the way so.. lets go!" said Urda as she helps Ikari get up.

"Oh well, I wonder what's happening with Jomi..." said Mijo as all of them walked over to the group.

*To the Depths of the Abyss*

"Show yourself, before I go ahead and find you instead!" taunted Jomi as she goes with her army around the abyss base.

"Well well, It has been a long time, Dark Princess..." said a figure in the dark.

"Wait, I know you! You're the _Abyss Doctor!_ You only hid in the abyss instead of being defeated..." said Jomi as she realizes who she's dealing with.

"Hehe.. Smart as ever, hmm? Ah well, I'm afraid this is just a test, an experiment to see a possibility, now—" 

Jomi tried to surprise the _Abyss Doctor_ with her lightning slash but he was protected by a shield and so she was knocked back.

"You think I wouldn't have a shield on? Or you just don't want to know what you came here for... answers..?" said the _Abyss Doctor_, in a mocking tone.

"Alright, fine. I am here for answers, but that doesn't mean you can hide there forever!" shouted Jomi but still negotiating with the abyss.

"Oh yes certainly, you only cut off the most important piece.. my data is complete. But, judging by you.. I think you know when we'll meet again... Goodbye, and have at 'em!" said the _Abyss Doctor_ in a sassy and mocking tone before leaving, as a horde of monsters spawn from everywhere, the floors, his former place, everything in the room.

"Men! Fall back! We can't risk dying here without good gains..." ordered Jomi as she and her army retreated from the abyss.

*To the Darkness*

"So what did you get in the AP quiz? I messed up... quite badly in some of the questions..." said Mijo.

"Wait, no— was it because of the graph? You told me that earlier!" said Ikari.

"Damn, I feel bad for you.. I mess up sometimes, it just happens haha.." responded Urda.

After chatting for a bit they saw a human figure, throwing out bombs and stabbing anyone that came close to them, she looked like a witch in form.

"Uh hey! Who are you?" called Ikari to the unknown person.

"Woah— Ah! It's only you... You scared me there Ikari..." said Lauvielle as she stopped due to them arriving.

"Hey, might wanna—"

Mijo got cut off before Urda ran near Lauvielle then killed the abyss monsters for her.

"—kill those guys first..." 

"Ugh, Mijo, stop yapping and start attacking!" said Ikari before also joining in on the action.

"Ok, Fine!" said Mijo as he also joins in.

Afterwards, the amount of abyss monsters dwindled then they stopped after the last one died.

"Gu— Guys..." said Ikari as she is breathing very heavily.

"What..?" questioned Mijo as he also breathes heavily.

"Let's... lie down.." said Urda as she faceplants on the floor. Everyone lays down on the floor.

"I.. think you guys exhausted yourselves a bit much.." said Lauvielle, concerned about her friends.

"Yeah.. Its fine... We got you, Lauvielle." said Urda, picking herself back up.

"I have never done _this_ much fighting in a while..." said Ikari, breathing heavily and laying on the floor as others were sitting instead.

"Anyways, it seems that there are barely any monsters left..." said Mijo, looking around the group.

"Urda! Urda! Someone is calling you, their name was like Jomi or something..." called out Reeb, as she was running towards them.

"Oh! Jomi has returned and is probably looking for us, come everyone." said Mijo, getting up on his feet.

"Yeah, we're going.." said Urda as she does the same.

So slowly, they all got up and started walking back to where the Oxir group was along with Jomi and some of her army. They arrive and this is the conversation that followed:

"Oh finally, you arrive. Anywho, I need a huge favor and.. I need to speak with Mijo. Privately."
said Jomi, resolute yet shaken by the events earlier.

"Ah sure! Guys wait here, and uh go with Urda, Ikari." said Mijo to his group.

"Ok... Let's go Ikari." said Urda, secretly having some questions about the whole thing.

"Uh, sure..?" said Ikari too, questioning the private conversation secretly.

"Let's go guys! Let's give them space, anyways, what was..." said Lauvielle as Mijo walks with Jomi to a place without a lot of people, near the castle.

"Ok, so here's the thing, I don't want to have them worry and... I don't think I can hide anything from you, so let me just tell you this right now..." explained Jomi, so tired and yet still wants to talk.

"Hmm ok. I understand. Ok, I won't reveal anything unless you tell me to." assured Mijo, curious about what Jomi is about to say.

"Ok, so... no sugarcoating, the _Abyss Doctor_ is back." said Jomi, straight to the point.

"What?! Now?! Uh... Do you know what he is doing back?" questioned Mijo, remembering past events.

"He seems to be preparing for something, a plan of his i don't like. He said that his data collecting is done..." said Jomi, summarizing what the doctor has said.

"Oh no, do you know when he is coming back? Because he is definitely coming back for something.." questioned Mijo, as he began formulating plans in his mind.

"Hmm, he didn't tell me. But I know it already. It's the day of your year end party." answered Jomi, also thinking about plans.

"What?! That's like 3 days from now, why did he suddenly appear now, instead of later in the week??" said Mijo, worrying about the intramurals.

"I don't know. But I have to keep the patrol and scouts up if he comes back. You should be wary of him when you plan your intramurals." said Jomi, as she makes a smile that only tired people make.

"Ah, that. Well I guess I should have a plan tomorrow, no ambitious stuff though, we got delayed by the abyss..." said Mijo, already thinking of some board games that can work.

"Ok. Let's head back. We should close the dark worlds by this point." said Jomi, as both of them started walking back to the group.

"Hmm, I wonder why this hasn't affected the whole 'worlds colliding if too much darkness' stuff that you were saying about..." questioned Mijo as they walked.

"Well, after the cataclysmic event that happened during grade 8, i made _sure_ to make it so that isn't a problem. I used _some_ abyss powers to do that however, which I can't say I regret doing, but I could have done better purifying..." said Jomi, as they finally finished and met with the others.

"Hii! Your back!!! Finally, we were about to go to you, because we were getting bored here.." said Lauvielle, getting bored standing around and talking.

"Yeah, let's just close the other dark worlds, then we can go home..." said Mijo, exhausted but determined to see it through.

Then JR and Rhida arrive at Jomi's Castle with a bunch of remaining grade 9 alive.

"Hey, so this is the last one, right Rhida?" said JR, counting the fountains written on his paper.

"Yep! and this looks like the most important one." said Rhida, looking at the castle and the fountain beside it.

"Hey! What's up!! JR and.. Rhida!" said Mijo with a smile, noticeably at JR.

"Hey. We are done here, and this is the last one, so. let's close this one?" answered JR back.

"Yeah, sure. This was all unexpected anyway. See you, soon?" said MIjo, now turning to Rhida.

"Uh, yeah... C- Can you do it, Mijo?" questioned Rhida, surprised about Mijo looking at her but still managed to blurt out something.

"Y- yeah.. Hold on." answered Mijo, surprised about Rhida too.

Then Mijo went and closed the fountain by offering his heart, then light covered all of their eyes and then, they were back in Honrato. Mijo was laying down on the floor of the computer lab.

"Ugh, man, I hate these types of transitions... Anyway..." said Mijo, as he got up and surveyed the room to find Ikari getting up and Lauvielle near the door, also getting up.

"What, does this happen every time? Man..." responded Ikari, looking around her.

"Yeah, well... when there's no reasonable way for us to have fallen asleep... At least according to our research." said Lauvielle, also looking around.

"We should go out, it is almost night, and we should go home." said Mijo, as he looked outside to see a blue sky almost getting dark.

"Oh... It's 5:30 PM.." said Ikari, as she looked at her phone. "Well— I better go, this meeting has gone longer than I wanted, so imma go— byeeee!"

"Bye, Ikari!" said Lauvielle and Mijo as she went out of the room.

"Uh, how about you? I still have to wait a couple of minutes..." questioned Mijo to Lauvielle, as he started writing down something.

"Hmm, right now! I bet all of my compadres in the service are ready to go, so.. I'm going too, stay safe!" answered Lauvielle before she also went out of the room.

"Ok, I should go as well, hmm," said Mijo as he looked for the lock... "Ah! There it is. Now let's just—" said Mijo as he goes out of the room then says, "—lock it. Ok then, i am getting out of here." as he locks the room.

"Hey... Mijo." said Rhida as she looked nervous and worried about something.

"Oh, uh— Hi! there..." said Mijo back, as he was surprised, then he started to feel nervous too.

"Let's keep this convo short and secret. Do you... still have feelings for me?" questioned Rhida as she looked down.

"Huh? Well, in truth, i don't know myself. I had this on and off thing with you and I don't know how to express it... I feel like whenever I get close to you, I mess it up, someway... How.. about you?" answered Mijo, as he cried a bit and kept looking at her.

Long silence, then he heard cries from her, as she said, "I.. didn't know you felt that way. I thought that I only had this thing for you and you didn't reciprocate... and I was fine with that. But now... I see. Um.. Well— you probably know that I have started seeing other people right?" also answered Rhida, with a question too.

"Hmm, i had suspicions, but since I thought that you moved on and I respected that, I just put it on the back of my mind. I have another question, do you think I have been seeing other people as well?" said Mijo to Rhida, now looking at her eyes.

"Y— Yeah... At first, it was Urda, then when the next grade came along, it was Ikari.. Is it all true? I still have no 'boyfriend' by the way, if that's what you were wondering..." said Rhida back, now staring back at Mijo.

"Well, I have suspicions, but I think both are truly just my friends, one is an unconfirmed asexual and one is a confirmed lesbian, so I don't know really... As for me, I also think of them as friends. Truly." said Mijo, now posing like he's thinking pretty hard.

"That's.. fine! Ok, this convo is over, as my parents are waiting for me... Bye! Uh, see you soon!" said Rhida, saying goodbye to Mijo and going downstairs to go home.

"You too!" said Mijo, bidding farewell too,he also went down, making sure to not look like they are together.

As he went home, he thought to himself, what caused this sudden conversation with Rhida and how this would change the dynamics between them. But as he got home and changed to house wear, he decided to focus on the intramural plan he was working on, tomorrow will be a blast.

He woke up the next day, feeling tired but as soon as he looked at the date, he exclaimed; "It's Intramurals Season!", so off he went to get ready and after that, go to school.

Soon after arriving, he quickly ran to his room to set up the stuff but he opened the classroom door to see darkness...

"Oh, damn. Well that makes sense, I am kinda late, and I doubt they waited for me... But who opened it?" said Mijo to himself before he jumped down into the darkness, seeing him transform to his usual dark self then after landing, seeing the huge castle ahead of him.

He went to the castle and to the Great Hall in which he found 9-Lit chilling in the Dining Area and Jomi and Ikari, speaking to each other.

"So this is how you open it? Coool!" exclaimed Ikari, reading a book.

"Yeah, be careful though, we don't want to break the balance ok?" said Jomi, looking at Ikari.

"Hey guys! So, who opened this one?" greeted Mijo, looking at Jomi.

"Oh, uh it was... Urda? She said to 'not worry' and that she 'got it' So i let her go into the room and when i looked at her, she already stabbed the ground and the dark world was opening... then i met her." said Ikari, pointing to Jomi.

"Ah nice... Any new games there, or do I have to bring mine?" said Mijo, as he checked his bag for his games again.

"Ah! Now for that, I have an answer, your games are already in!" exclaimed Jomi excitedly, grinning to Mijo.

"Whe— Oh.. well i am going to check inside the dining area, see ya!" said Mijo, before he took off.

After he went in, he saw his creations, such as the _'Mijo's Monster Battle V.2.4'_, the _'Dance of CHAOS V1.6'_, the _'Extreme Ball Drive V.1.1'_ and the _'Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4'_. He also saw Jomi's creations such as the _'Test of Resolute Will V3.0'_, the _'Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta'_ and the _'Jomi's Magical Sports V1.0'_

"Damn, she really did? Ok, hmm, oh hey! The dining wall board! It looks like the advertisements for the games are here... Let me see..." said Mijo, as he looked and found the advertisement poster of Jomi.

    ## Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4
    A game where you shoot enemies far away by using an AWP-styled gun to score points, with limited ammo and time. There's two game modes, level and endless. Endless is self-explanatory, you get given a map where you constantly reposition and shoot enemies before the timer runs out, and there's escort and normal. Escort is where you kill enemies because there's a transport you have to protect from damage. Level is two parts, escort and normal. This time enemies are limited but there is still a timer.

There are three types of domains, the endless (The Dance of Fate)  where you try to kill as much of the waves of enemies possible before you run out of health or you run out of time. Next is the Daily Domains (Daily Battles(, in which, everyday, a rotation of domains are set and you can go battle them to get day-specific rewards. Lastly is the 'Memories of Adventures' in which you go through levels made by Jomi and others that recreate their adventures such as the _Abyss Doctor_ fight, the Shley fight, and the all-favorite Jomi fight. 
    All of these modes give you lots of rewards which allow you more space and energy to train and fight. Enjoy the domains, and see you when I see you!
    
    ## Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta
    A game where you experience the turn-based combat with more immersion! Right now, there are only the test domains, which are copied from the levels of TRW, so the combat can be tested.

"Oh wow, she put the details of my games too? She's gotta be one of those fast learners I suppose, hmm, although there's barely a tutorial.. Whatever, I am sure it's accurate, I've checked already!" said Mijo to himself as he looks around and checks out the games.

"Hey there Mijo..." said JR, surprising Mijo as he looked at the games.

"Oh! JR! Hi there, so uh what game you wanna play, i wanna do the TRW thing, it's basically shingen impact!" said Mijo, who's now looking at JR.

"Ok. Hmmm, what mode and what weapons?" said JR as he walks with Mijo to where the game is.

"I want my normal swordsman and electro type.  How about you? Default as well?" said Mijo, who kept walking to the game with JR.

"Yep, mage and electro. Shouldn't we get someone else to get good elemental reactions?" said JR, now at the game selecting difficulty and mode.

"Yeah, i know the two, Jomi and Ikari." said Mijo, now done at the selection screen and is now waiting for other players.

"Ok, I'll stay here and wait for you, go get them!" said JR, now swiping to the enemies screen.

"Ok." said Mijo before quickly going to where Jomi and Ikari were.

"Here's how to beat it, trust me, you can do it. I have tested the games and they're quite fun and challenging!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari reading the tutorial of TRW level 10.

"Bro it is literally impossible, I mean that Shley is pretty dangerous and it's too OP! I don't even have a shield user unlike your fight!" argued Ikari as she looked mad at Jomi.

"Hey guys! Wanna play some TRW? Trust me, i have JR with me so it's gonna be a blast." said Mijo as he looked at both of them about to explode.

"Sure! I would love to, I have a lot of testing to do anyway, like Ikari here saying that the Shley 1v1 is too hard." said Jomi, looking at Mijo.

"Wha— Are you trying to imply something? Anyway, yeah. As long as I don't have to do those fights by myself with Jomi watching from the sidelines..." said Ikari, now calming down and looking at Mijo.

"Hey! I was making sure that I recognie the errors in my code, ok?" said Jomi, now looking at the ground.

"Good, now uh I guess you can all make up and don't have to almost kill each other..." said Mijo as the three of them shared a small awkward laugh and after, move to JR's position.

"Hmm, this is easy, this one, I have been there... and this one, looks challenging.. Oh hey guys!" said JR as he looked at the enemies at the level enemies screen.

"Hey! JR! So let's start the game now?" said Ikari as she very quickly got to the screen and started picking her character.

"Hmm, I'll pick my normal fire and sword type, how about you, Ikari?" said Jomi as she picked her character.

"I'll go with this heart thingy, looks like my element color which is green." said Ikari as she picked her character.

"Oh that's dendro, nice! Hmm your dendro gun and our reactions will make this easy... Quick, JR start it since you're the first one to put your character in!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari then to JR.

"Uh thanks?" thanked Ikari, confused to what Jomi said.

"Yep, I agree. Anyways lets start the game." said JR as he pressed play and all of them get transported to a familiar domain to the two of them.

"Woah, coool— this is what you've been working on, I was wondering..." said Mijo as they went towards a red key in the middle of the arena.

"Yeah, yeah.. All of you are familiar with this so let's start it." said Jomi as she touched the key and suddenly a bunch of enemies started appearing.

"Ok. *Let's dance!!* " said Mijo as they charged head-on towards the monsters.

Author's Note: DONE! Let's gooo! WE HAVE FINISHED a special chapter since this one even though not even complete has a lot of lore stuff that I will take in mind when writing the first ones. This is so cool! I was planning to do a students night chapter but I might continue Chapter 3, anyway, stay tuned here if I ever make that chapter. Also, I get it, some of these are 'inspirations' but you'll see how I improved upon it. Anyway.. Peace out, and see you!

<!--Chapter 4 draft, subject to change due to likely revision of earlier plot points-->
<p id="C4"><md-block># C4 DeltaRambles: The Student's Night</md-block></p>
<md-block>
## Summary: 

Mijo is surprised when there's a huge week, full of events in both of the worlds. At first, it starts full of fun as the quarter wraps up, a student's night along with a food fest. Unfortunately for Mijo and his fellow lightners, the abyss order has planned for an extraordinary event to coincide with the week.

## Author's Note: 

Oh, so originally this was a spinoff, but I realized it would be better as a chapter, so it is now! Though, the lore... Oh well, you'll see what I wrote soon enough.

The food fest is an excuse to refine some of Mijo's parts that I want to pay off in S1, and also, since this is a spinoff, I don't have to think much, which is great, since I don't have a lot of time to think too, hehe.. Anyways, enjoy!

Edit 1: So.. I have combined two drafts of c4 into one so hopefully that works out. That means that currently, we are going with thia draft, but trust me, you'll see the fruits of this soon.

Edit 2: If you have read the spinoff: It's Magic Time, they have similar scenes and downright the exact same in some aspects, although this is written way after the spinoff, this is the original base I was thinking of as I wrote the spinoff, my goal is for this and the spinoff to follow a similar trajectory while being completely different.

---

On a random school day, as Mijo is practicing his fighting, using a variety of weapons: 

His main sword, his katana; for quick slashes and quick parries more on deflecting, it can summon slashes and is the best sword when he is in the air, as he can summon slashes and when he goes down, knocking back enemies using the force from his sword. He also uses this as his main ultimate as he uses it to dash through reality to cut through the veil of time and space. 

His odachi, for slower and stronger slashes, used for piercing and more aggressive plays. It usually involves more aggressive parries that you initiate and win, or you battle and win. He also uses it to pierce enemies and is better against shielded enemies. His ultimate here, involves slowing time to hit more precise slashes to decimate enemies.

He also wielded other weapons that he returned to the owner, before replicating it on his training ground, such as scythe from Sasha, and snake sword from JR.

"Every single day I become more like Dante... Well.. Eh, nothing could be done about it. I like my katana, but so many weapon variety to have fun with is fun too sometimes.. But my greatest would of course, always be my katana.." said Mijo to himself, as he practiced and practiced on a group of enemies.

"Hey there.. You bored yet, Mijo?" said Jomi, as she comes into his training ground. "Maybe? Why..? Anything interesting happening outside here?" said Mijo, as he slashes through a training monster.

"Yeah, a lot actually. That's why Urda isn't here, or even Rhida, they're both buying.. i don't know, but they seem to be enjoying the event in town." said Jomi, as Mijo looks at her. "Oh, ok. What's the event then? Combat related?  Hopefully, but I don't mind if it's not.. i guess." said Mijo, as he stopped the fight and looked at Jomi in anticipation.

"Well, it's not combat—" "Awwww", interrupted Mijo as Jomi continued, "—But! It has food! Good food! All affordable, trust me."

"Uh, sure.. I don't have anything else to do anyway, especially during these times. Well, let's go. You coming with?" said Mijo, as Jomi said, "Well, that's why I am here... Let's go!"

_As they head off to the fountain, Mijo is thinking about something._

"Hey, wait a minute.. We're going to the light world? Aren't you a darkner?", said Mijo, as Jomi nodded, but responded, "Well, yeah. You'll see." 

"Wait.. You'll.. But why... Ok. Fine." said Mijo as he went back to the light world. He then looks to the school, from the second floor railings, until he realizes something.

"Gosh, it's been a year! We probably should celebrate one year of the dark world. But.. I need to.. organize first. Which.. I don't want to do. Too tiring." said Mijo to himself, as Ikari notices him again, staring off into the distance. "Hey! So..! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you still be training in the dark world?" questioned Ikari, as Mijo looks at her.

"Uh.." Mijo looked at the gym and saw no notable event happening, then he continued, "Hey, uh is there like a food fest or anything gonna happen in the gym?" questioned Mijo, as Ikari thought for one second, then said, "Nah.. In fact, I was just about to go to the dark world.. Soo... Can you accompany me there?" 

"What? Really..?! You.. are a grown woman, well.. somewhat. You can go there by yourself! Don't worry, Jomi is there if you need anything, and.. I think Lauvielle's there, not sure." said Mijo, as Ikari reiterated, "Ehh, come on, it's just when going in, I trust you're busy, so no more than that! Ok?"

Mijo looks at the gym, again. Then looks at Ikari and says, "Suure.. You know what, let's go to Jomi's town. I wanna see what Jomi was talking about some food fest stuff.", Ikari smiled then she said, "Yeah! Then we can check out what Jomi is cooking! Her cooking is fire!!"

_Then they go to the dark world, where they fall to where they see Jomi going out of her castle and looking at them._

"Hey! I just came back from some.. important stuff and I was about to go here to wait for Mijo, then you lot dropped in!" exclaimed Jomi, as the two notice her and are happy. "Hey!!! Jomi!!!" said Ikari, as they both hugged as Mijo smiled and said, "Ikari, you just missed 1 week, you miss her that much? Oh, and.. thank you, Jomi."

"What?!; Can't hug a friend?!" responded Ikari, as Jomi smiled and said, "Y— Yeah. Sure. Um, let's go!" said Jomi, as they stopped hugging and started to go to the actual town. 

"Soo.. uh.. what do you do here, anyway? I've never actually questioned what you and Jomi do in the dark world, except for what you always tell me, Um.... 'training' is what you always say.", Mijo thinks about what to say, but Jomi responds for him, "He.. says training but he's usually there to reflect and fighting is therapeutic for him, as for me, I manage the town here, and I research new magic stuff sometimes."

"Woah! That sounds cool! Can you make a custom gun? Cause' this one—", Ikari brings her gun out, "—is kinda.. boring? Look, I've *never* fought a lot but, this one.. It's like— it isn't the best! So.. can you make me one, please? I'll even give you... ummm.. what do mayors want..?", Jomi smiled and looked at Mijo, as Mijo nodded at Jomi, and said, "Well, you should ask her? But, since I have known her since.. well, for a year or so, I know that.. she would like a pendant."

Ikari turned to Jomi and said, "Is this true? This guy—", she pointed to Mijo, then turned back to Jomi, "He's smart.. But he can often misremember things.. So, since he just said, 'ask you', I am asking you, so what ya want?", Jomi laughed and responded, "Well, this is one he remembers.. A pendant with.. a flower! Oh heck, even a witch hat, just having pendants to wear looks nice!"

"Noted. Anyways, you got something to say, Mijo?", as Ikari noticed Mijo about to say something before closing his mouth. "Uh, nothing. Just.. thinking about something.", said Mijo, as Jomi speaks up, "Yeah.. don't bother. If he wants to say something. He will probably have already said it."

"True. But.. it's still worth trying. Anyways, I am sure it's nothing. Let's continue!" said Ikari, as Mijo and Jomi smiled, as Jomi notices. "Yeah, I agree. Let's make this last.", said Jomi, as they continue heading to the town.

They go into Jomi's Town, and see Urda at first, checking out some new games that were included with the food fest, such as the old classics, Test of Resolute Will and Mijo's Monster Battle and the all-new Trailblazer's Traveling Bus, formerly known as Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta.

"So.. As you can see, Mijo, I have been working with Rhida, JR and Urda to update these games, and it's been fun!" said Jomi, as they walked to Urda, before she heard them and said, "Yeah, I didn't have much input on the game though, my job was visuals and sound effects, which.. look for yourself!", then she pointed them to the new game.

"Woah... This is.. interesting. At the same time as the light counterpart too.." said Mijo, before Ikari commented, "Hmm, I wonder, does anyone even play 'games' here when we have magic?"

"Well, as you can see... It's still appealing! Since, however you change it, danger, risk and potential harm is still at play when it comes to these parts, so these games exist! It has also been.. a long passion of ours to make an actual game people enjoy.." said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Mhmm.. Well, you wanna join us, Urda?" questioned Mijo to Urda, as she thinks for a second then says, "Another time, dude."

"I understand, let's go, Ikari." said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other and headed deeper into the streets of the town, where Rhida's group can be found eating near a huge food stall.

"Hi! Rhida!!" said Jomi, as they both hugged each other, and Rhida said, "It's been a while, Jomi! Like, actually.. Ever since we finished wor last week, I have never seen you! Even in your castle! At least, when I went there.."

"I am *sooo* sorry, Rhida..! Like, I was busy these past few days, I couldn't even talk to Mijo! Oh, um... yeah! Here's Mijo, and that's Ikari...!" said Jomi, as they look at the two, with the others, like Mack, who was smiling and Rhida, who was pretty awkward seeing Mijo, but she still had a smile, but it was obvious as to what she was currently feeling.

"Hi, Rhida. Long time no see too! We haven't, well at least not... well, um.. talked, since the last world ending disaster..." said Mijo, as Ikari commented, "Jeez, you two have so much tension...", forgetting that everyone heard her.

"Haha— Wh— What do you mean— Ikari? It's nothing! Just.. mmm..." said Mijo, before Jomi got them out of the awkward situation by saying, "Yeah, but.. you know how it is.. No one's willing to say anything, so why bother?"

"Yeah! Why bother.. *ahem* Let's change the topic! Something a bit more light hearted! Like, like.." said Rhida, as she struggled to come up with words to say, until Fexili said, "How about the good food! I just _loove_ the churros around here, it's great!"

"Oh yeah! That, and the fruit drinks, especially the one that sparkles!!! Oooh just thinking about it, hey! Let's go there!" said Rhida, as Mijo said, "I would, but we won't be following just yet. See you around, Rhida."

"Oh, um.. Ok.. Guys, let's go!" said Rhida as Rhida's group headed off to some other stall, as Mijo's group explored the area, finding more stalls and more food, until it was time to head home.

_Hours later.._

"Wow! I did not expect that burger, the cheese, and the meat! I mean, it's a homemade burger, but it still tastes amazing..!" said Mijo, as Ikari laughs and nods, agreeing with his statement.

"Awww.. It looks like it's time to head home.. It's 17:00, Mijo.." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked and Ikari's a bit confused but then after a while gets it.

"Ohhh! Shit, it's 5! I better go back now, see you two tomorrow, bye!!!" said Ikari, before running, to go back to the light and towards home. "Haha.. Well, you still got an hour, what do *you* wanna do?" said Jomi, as Mijo looks at Ikari slowly disappears out of view.

"Ughh... I guess it's time to say something about.. what exactly were you busy for those days, hmm?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi has a big exasperated sigh, knowing it was inevitable. "Just.. the usual... Abyssal problems, as always. It's not going out of control, yet. But.. I suspect that.. we aren't out of the danger yet."

"What?! I thought the *Abyss Doctor's* threats were null when he didn't show up at the year end party?!" said Mijo, as he looked increasingly more worried, but Jomi has more to say, "Yeah, and that is because of me. Sorry. _He_ is always vague so I can't exactly predict him, and.. you understand me right?! I was exhausted and was already swirling with hundreds of information, there's a mistake that happened there..."

 "I.. never confronted you directly, since I was just thankful that there weren't any abyss monsters, but how can I trust you, if you can make mistakes as important as this, how can I know if I should be scared?!" said Mijo, as Jomi stares off, not looking at Mijo, feeling guilty and pressured. "I.. can't say anything else, other than sorry, I'll be better. But, you have to trust me on this one, ok, this time it will also be just you, so if anything happens it's between *you* and *me.* Got it...?"

"Ok, got it... It was just a week ago, when the world was in darkness, again..." said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. Jomi added, "Yeah, and you know what's the worst part, _he_ knew exactly where I was at during that time, tired and exhausted, it's probably what he wanted me to be when meeting him..."

"I see.. So, you have any non half asleep thoughts on when *he* is coming back?" questioed Mijo, as Jomi laughed and said, "Ah.. That is exactly why I didn't initiate, I have no answer. Let's meet back up tomorrow, during the student's night." 

"Ah! And— and, where exactly? I can't just show up in full suit and tie and go into the dark world, you know how these things play out..!" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed again and said, "Well, let's just say.. I made a little spell that makes this easier...", then Jomi casts something that affects Mijo's mind, Mijo feels this.

"Ugh.. You can do this?!" said Mijo, as Jomi turns to her serious face and says, "Of course. We are connected, and this magic is only powerful since we are so related.", then she smiles, "That means this is special for us!"

"I... trust you, but what will you do with this? Does it affect the mind..?" said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and said, "It allows me to exist in your mind, simple."

"WHAT?!" said Mijo, as he checks the time, and realized it's time for him to go. "Ok, ok.. Mhmm... I'll see you I guess.", as he left the dark world.

_He went home, and he and his mother prepared for the student's night tomorrow._

"Alright, so me and your sis agreed on this, it's reusing your year end party clothes, but with a bit more specialty in the night. Look here." said May, his mother, as he looks and sees, blue polo, with long sleeves, a black coat, long dark blue pants, and a grey tie.

"Oh nice. Well, it looks good to me." said Mijo, before May looks at him, she laughs a bit. "Everything looks good to you, nak, even the pajamas."

"Haha.. That's just how I roll. Anyways Imma go to my computer, it seems everything's prepared.." said Mijo, before May nods, indicating acknowledgement.

As he goes to his computer, in his room, he sees Jomi, dressed in a black gown, with her hair stylized longer, going over her shoulders, and she has no glasses, she is sitting on the small sofa in his room.

"Hi there!" greeted Jomi, as Mijo is surprised by this and says, "H— huh?! Oh— it's you. So.. um, how are you here, again?"

"Oh nothing much, just in my empty room connecting to you using magic, hey, I picked out _my_ best clothes! Uh, where are we... anyway?" explained Jomi, as she looks around the room. "This is my room in the light world, as you can see, it looks eerily similar to the dark one.", said Mijo, as he showed Jomi around, holding her hand.

"Oh wow, this house... Mmm.. Well, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo sits on his revolving chair, "Programming, my light hobby. I write the scripts here for the dark games as well as my journey in the dark world, hey, it's genuinely a good fantasy story for other people, I just changed the names around for the lightners, like here!"

"Mmm? The characters... Oh, Mihe and Rica? The first sounds like you just changed the ending of your name to the 'eh' sound, and the other one, you just switched D to a C, and called it a day!" said Jomi, as she looked at the character list. "Yeah! I know right, creative naming on my part, but.. are you not going to tell me what the *abyss doctor* is doing?" said Mijo, as Jomi pulled away from him and said, "Mmm.. Like I said, tomorrow. I just tested the system to see if it is working."

"I see. Well.. Oooh! Wait I have a question! How do other people see me, like when I hold you?" said Mijo, as Jomi sits down and says, "Haha... Well, it's like when you interact with me, like let's say you try to float by stepping on me, you think you are.. But the moment that someone sees where I am supposed to be, you fall." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked by this, "I see, so I'm basically delusional. What if I don't notice the person, what happens?"

"Well, it's obvious. You're just moving normally, like if you're floating, you're just on the ground. The sensation of falling only happens to you, you just return to your senses." explained Jomi, as Mijo processes what Jomi said, and says, "Aight, cool. That's all I have to say, you can get out of my head now."

"Sure. I only have one more thing to say, what I am doing is best in the light world, as this type is hard in the dark world since your magic can unintentionally prevent my projection, which already is causing a lot of my energy." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and looked at his computer, "Aight, that's good to know, but.. now that I know it's possible...", before Mijo looks concerned thinking about the multiple ways of using it.

"Everything's possible, Mijo. Anyways, Imma go, see you!" said Jomi, as she left Mijo's mind, letting him procrastinate on school work alone. 

*Alarm starts, it's loud, and it's singing "When I look in the mirror, can't believe what I see—"*

He turned off the alarm, and woke up the next day, tired but excited as today was the anticipated student's night, so he excitedly did his morning routine and headed off to school, as there was still the morning and afternoon preparations to do.

"Alright, few things to do, I guess. Well, Jomi, follow me if you want." said Mijo to himself in the mirror as he went and did his morning routine. Then as he got his clothes, his mom called him, "Hey! Your night clothes are on the right and the day clothes are on the left!", Mijo responded, "Got it!", as he started dressing using the day clothes.

He went to school, dressed up like a 'writer' from the 1890s because that's what the clothes insinuated from his style of choice. Then he went to the dark world to visit Jomi, before the event. His wear in the dark world is a bit different, changing to a more dark blue and dark yellow coloring on his coat and jacket, respectively.

"Huh, she isn't here.. Weird, she always met me here.. Maybe busy? But.. she said... hmm.." said Mijo, as he looked around, he decided to head inside Jomi's castle, but as he went closer, some of Jomi's guards noticed him and approached him.

"Sir Mijo, unfortunately, your Majesty has gone out on an expedition into the abyss for 'important business'. This is what the princess told me." said the guard, before Mijo looked shocked and worried. "I.. see. Have you come across any lightners other than me?" questioned Mijo, as the other guard shook his head, indicating that he was the first one.

"Huh..? That's weird. Well, I suppose I'll go inside, then." said Mijo, before the guard stopped him and said, "Sorry, the princess has also ordered us to stop anyone from going inside the castle, including you, sir."

"Weird.. Alright, guess I'll have to see her another time. Goodbye, soldier!" said Mijo, as he waved goodbye to the guards before going back to the light world.

_To the light, between the room of the section of Lithium (Lit) Room and the Computer Lab II, where the dark world is._

"Are you sure, he's gonna dance with you?" questioned Urda, before Lauvielle answered, "Nah, I don't have faith in him now, especially considering before."

"Hey gals! Um, you uh seen the dark world?" questioned Mijo, as he sees the clothes of the two, both having casual attire. "No, actually, we were just about to jump in after talking, what? Another problem?" responded Urda, having mixed feelings about the question.

"Yeah... Jomi is apparently not allowing anyone to her castle and the town, she's on some.. quest." said Mijo, as the other two looked at him with confusion. "What **quest?**" asked Urda, as Mijo shrugged his shoulders and shook his head. "I don't know, she didn't tell the guard at the castle." answered Mijo, as the other two looked at each other with concern.

"Yeah, uh.. It must be important fighting she has to do, We probably can't do much about it." reassured Mijo, as the other two hesitantly nodded. "Welp, let's trust the princess and hope she stays safe. Anyways, I'm going into the party, in the room." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as Urda watched them. "Oh? Um.. go ahead, uh.. I'll be staying out here. I don't.. participate in the early games." responded Mijo, as Lauvielle looked directly at Mijo's eyes, and nodded. "Finee.. But, stay safe okay? Just.. if you need help in the dark world, you can message the group chat." responded Lauvielle, before she left to go inside their classroom.

"Mijo, you're going into the dark world? Without us? You might face a threat you can't face on your own, you know. There's also a chance you might get corrupted by the abyss, and.. I'm just worried you won't survive." said Urda, looking very worried. "I know, I know. If you're that worried, why don't you come with me?" questioned Mijo, as Urda looked away. "I.. don't want to leave my other friends, Mijo. I.. also can't leave without you guaranteeing you're still going to be here afterwards." answered Urda, looking at Mijo seriously.

"I see. I'll.. stay safe, but.. I can't just.. stay put in any party and also not figure out what's happening in the dark world. If Jomi was needed somewhere else so much that she couldn't stay to at least inform me, then it must be serious. Don't worry, my friend. I'll be fine, I'll call for help at the GC if I need to do so." responded Mijo, as Urda sighed and put her hand on his shoulder. "You better be." said Urda with a faint smile, before hesitantly leaving.

Mijo stands there silent, while the audio of rowdy school parties and pop music is blasting in the background. He looks to the dark world that's behind him, inside a familiar room. "I should go then. While the castle is locked down, I can explore other areas and gather info." said Mijo to himself before he went to the door and tried to open it. "Wait, locked?" exclaimed Mijo, as he saw the normal room that was there before he opened the dark world.

"H—huh? What..?" asked Mijo, as he looked around him and saw a faint area of darkness at the demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it. "Am I seeing things or is that a dark fountain about to burst?" questioned Mijo, before he ran there, making sure to look out for anyone, but luckily most of the people were busy and didn't notice him. As he ran, the spot slowly grew darker and darker. Eventually, as he arrived close to the spot, a dark abyss figure materialized in front of him.

"You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "God, I'm so fudged." exclaimed Mijo, as he tried to summon his sword but to no avail. Mijo hummed and got his phone as the figure stayed defensive, as it gained more and more power. 

Mijo: @everyone abyss threat pls help thank u

Mijo then looked at the abyss figure approaching him intimidatingly. "Welp.. Technically, I put myself in danger.." said Mijo before the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground. 

"**MIJO!!!**" screamed Rhida, as JR, Lauvielle and Ikari from the section of Lithium room, Urda from the Oxygen (Oxir) room ran to Mijo's position, with her.

_Unknown dark space, Mijo wakes up with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center._

 "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and dropped it to the ground, then he fell. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword  and summoned the hilt while fighting through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up…" said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two helped Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "We saw your message and quickly headed out, saw _that_ thing and you.." trailed off Lauvielle, before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others tried to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summoned his sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and killed the dark figure, making it disappear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others looked at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?' said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they wave goodbye to Mijo. As he rested and reflected, Urda, Rhida and Ikari were coincidentally right next to each other as the others left.

"Hey, you two.. You uh.. worried about Mijo? He seems to be.. well, going through a lot. I am not sure what he went through as he was.. in my arms but.. seeing his.. face and the fact that he hasn't even tried to get his stuff yet, I am.. concerned." said Rhida to the other two as they look at Mijo still staring off into the distance. "Yeah.. But, if you're thinking that we can help him, you should probably exclude me. I am the worst at.. comforting people, and he even comforts me a lot of the time… anyways, my dad's calling. See you two later!" responded Ikari as she left waving goodbye at the other two. "Is.. she saying the truth?" asked Rhida to Urda, as Urda shrugs and answers, "I don't know honestly.. I don't know much about her besides being her research partner, after she switched with her old one.. Mijo told me it was for complicated reasons but.. Lauvielle left early so I can't ask anyone else besides him."

"Uhuh.. Well, someone has to give him his stuff, and the rice container he brought.. Apparently his contribution to the party of his section..?" said Rhida, finding a way to smile amidst her troubled emotions. "Haha, well. I could do it, I guess.. But.. considering previous events.. You should do it." responded Urda, as Rhida blushed and said, "Huh? What? No no way..! Haha, even considering that.. You should do it, you were friends with him longer!'

"Hah? Really, are you missing this opportunity? Come on, sis its like a chance to dance with somebody, like the song they played at the mass demo for some reason.. I got this, you know.. like, I won't be jealous, ok?" retorts Urda, trying to hide her confusing feelings. "I—is that— No way, I am.. not that confident, well no I am confident, just.. that we have a lot of baggage ok? You get it, and his parents might be calling him!" responds Rhida, as she looks over to Mijo then back to Urda. "Right, and that's why you should get this stuff and give it to him, and as he checks his belongings, you can ask him about—" said Urda, before being interrupted by Rhida, "W—what? You have experience? Like you've been trying to see if he likes you back by doing only subtle things to not ruin your relationship?"

"N—no… You're projecting your own actions, I.. uhh don't have any feelings, ok? Just, platonic pure gamer buddies.. always have.. been… Yep…" responds Urda, as she sits down on a nearby seat, now more troubled. "Um.. I.. think we have our own unresolved issues.. I.. didn't know you.. I'll go now." said Rhida, as she gives more space to her and Urda. Then as soon as Rhida was far enough, Mijo finally stood up and saw the two far away from each other, and his things at a table near the two girl's things.

"You two, are you still waiting for your parents?" asked Mijo, as he grabbed his things and checked his phone. The two girls tried to say something, but they fell short on what to say. "I see. Well, here's my glasses.. and oh look, perfect timing, my parents are on the way, judging by the time, they should be near.." continued Mijo, as he wore his glasses, and continued to look at his phone. "I.. guess I'll be the first one. My parents are here, so.. Um.. hey, uh Mijo. Once the party happens, come meet me at the spot near the CR's, you'll know when.. I.. think. I'll go now, see you two later!" proposed Rhida as she left, and waved goodbye as Mijo turned his attention to Urda.

"Oh, my turn.. again. Well, I am.. embarassed to say it, but to just confirm, you heard the entire convo earlier, right?" questioned Urda, as Mijo chuckles and answers, "Yeah, unwittingly.. I was going to grab my stuff but, I noticed you three talking so I stayed until done.."

"Oh. Oh. I am.. uh.. it took this long to reveal it huh.. Even after I thought you moved on.. Well, thanks for staying true to me all those times.. I—it's my fault, i guess.. I had.. romantic feelings for you, I should've just told you directly. But, you got her, Rhida.. And, we're just best friends." continued Urda, as she teared up a little. "I.. should go.. My parents are calling me and.." said Urda, before Mijo hugged her for a while before she broke away and said, "Thanks. Even though I know what your feelings are, you're still willing to give this.. girl something to hold onto. Goodbye, see ya." said Urda as she waved goodbye before Mijo also went home making sure to not bother her before she turned a corner. Then started walking because his parents were there way earlier than he expected.

He went home and rested on his bed as he stared at the ceiling, processing the events. He checked the GC to see the messages, there's only from Urda;

Urda: @everyone the current crisis has been temporarily fixed by the Mijo and the gang so enjoy your students night until another one appears lol

"Huh, ok.. Guess I don't need to message them then." said Mijo, as he closed his phone and drifted to sleep, as he was still exhausted from the battle. In his dreams, the day was replaying in his head.

Mijo walked straight, as the events of the day played out, the food fest, the many emotions that had been revealed, and how he was going to face the others later. He saw many many possibilities of rejection, regret and loss, while other possibilities of joy, fun and contentment. These events played out until he saw a female form of himself, different from Jomi, but close enough that it seemed to be a possible insight into his inner desires. As he reached out, the body, wearing a simple yellow dress suddenly merged with him, and as he looked around looking dazed, he saw his body become the woman he was looking at.

"Crazy.. crazy.." said Mijo, as he looked around, seeing the student's night he was imagining. Lights all around, music blasting, people in dresses and suits walking around, all the while he was now carrying a yellow purse, and was also wearing yellow heels. He walked and glanced upon the surroundings, with fluttering eyes before he felt hands grabbing at him, pulling him away, he couldn't turn around to see who or what, he was just pulled away until everything went dark and he woke up.

"What was that?! I.. what.. Who.. was that..? And.. I.. can't.. it's just a dream.. right? Haha, yeah.. It's nothing, it.. doesn't represent anything, haha..? I.. uh.. don't.. have anything to talk about, I don't think that dream's real, it's just weird hehe.. I.. yeah sure.. Huh? My phone.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he checked his phone to see a message from Urda and Rhida. "Oh, it's them. I better go check their messages." said Mijo as he checked Urda's first.

Urda: Bro I just got a dream where I was like walking around and shit like alone in the school, then like out of nowhere a huge explosion occurred and I ran to see you just laying there but the weirdest part is that you were in a girl form instead, I thought you were Jomi but then Jomi came up and picked up your body, then told me that was you. Like????

"Oh. Lemme look at Rhida's then." said Mijo as he checked Rhida's message.

Rhida: Idk who to share this with but it includes you so i just had a dream where Jomi guided me to the school, there was a party apparently. Then she disappeared as then you appear in front of me, I tried to talk to you but you didn't answer and I was so confused before Urda talked to you and then you seemed to start talking with her and ignored me. I tried to talk to you, but then someone was dragging me down, until I saw you leave with her. I think you might wanna know haha

"Huh. Really? Interesting. They had the same location in the dream but.. looks like different.. issues. Ugh.. I really need to talk to Jomi.." said Mijo, as May calls him to prepare for the students night.

After dressing up for students night, wearing a dark blue polo, dark blue pants and a black coat he decided to keep in his sling bag as it was still a bit hot outside.

"Alright, you look good. Enjoy your night, 'nak!" said May, as he checked his belongings one more time, a ticket that he found while he was going through his stuff, it was the ticket to the students night area. Then his phone, handkerchief, water bottle, and coat. He then went to school as he was brought there by his dad.

"Goodbye anak enjoy your night!" said June, as Mijo entered the school grounds, waving goodbye back as his father left. Then he went inside as a teacher checked his bag for illegal stuff before letting him in, then he went to a student government panel where he saw a line for his grade.

"Huh, I guess that's what this is for.. I wonder who put it in here.." said Mijo, as he pulled out his ticket from his wallet and headed to a line, after waiting and being allowed in after signing in into a document, he sat where his fellow classmates are in the left side of the gymnasium as there were thousands of chairs organized. He picked a seat near some people he was acquainted with and sat down then he saw JR returning from the CR. He sat down soon after.

"Hey, uh who put the ticket to students night on my bag? I wasn't there for the entire party, so I couldn't have received it myself.." asked Mijo, as JR smirked and answered, "It was me.. I knew you wouldn't come back anyway, so I grabbed yours and put it in your bag."

"I see.. Thanks dude. Anyways, what do you think about the 'crisis'?" asked Mijo, still using codewords about the dark world related event they experienced earlier. "Hmm, well I think that the main problem likely isn't solved yet, and that's why I am staying here. I was going to leave and not even come here, but due to the issue, as well as the student government oath, I am here." responded JR, as he thought about being elected as a workshop manager in their local school robotics club.

"Cool, cool.. Is she here?" asked Mijo, as JR smiled and answered, "Duh. I was actually talking to her earlier, she's right there." as he pointed to a somewhat far away seat where Rhida was talking with some of her friends. "Oh then.. Ok, I'm just going to sit here.." said Mijo, as JR nodded and spoke to other people as he looked at his phone. He saw Ikari and Lauvielle separately panicking to him about being almost late since the time is getting closer to the start of the party. He looked back to his surroundings and saw Urda come in, speaking to her friends. He quickly looked away and took a picture of the general area as he saved it.

He decided to observe the people coming in while keeping himself busy by looking at the messages of his friends. He saw Leviente come in then Fexili, as the afternoon darkens. After a while, it was pretty much late now but a few people were still coming in. Ikari came in as she walked nearby him and sat behind a couple of chairs that were free.

"Hi! I didn't notice you enter actually, I was looking at Lauvielle's messages, It's a good thing that you arrived, before the gates closed haha." remarked Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and responded, "Yeah, I arrived before I saw your last message, anyway.., Hold on, I'm going to talk to someone else, see you later..!" as Ikari talked to someone nearby.

He then looked at his phone then back to the people, as he was observing and waiting for the event to start. He eventually saw Lauvielle come in, but he didn't talk to her, he just saw her go and sit at a nearby free chair. He got bored and started to play videogames on his phone before the event started and he put his phone in his bag.

"Hello, hello welcome to the night of your lives! As we celebrate another step of the school year, I would like to inaugurate our new school government, and associated clubs!" said the announcer on the stage. "Oh, it looks like the student government is on their way.." said Mijo to himself, as a bunch of random people, likely officers started to stand and walk near the stage.

"Ugh.. This is boring. I might as well go to the CR now.." said Mijo to himself, as he got out of his seat and went to the CR. Then as he went to the CR he bumped into Urda before going inside. "Oh, hi." said Urda, as Mijo waved and said, "Hi.. I'm going to the CR, so.. we'll talk later!" as he excused himself to continue inside the CR as he doesn't notice Urda's saddened expression.

After finishing, he went out of the CR and decided to head back, going through the same place he bumped into Urda before sitting down and seeing the inauguration happen and sighed. "You know what, Imma start drinking, this sucks." said Mijo, as he drank the rest of his water bottle. "Oh that's it.." said Mijo, as the inauguration finishes and the other students head back to their seat. Then their school principal starts a speech that Mijo quickly tunes out, "Man, can we just start the party, or will I have to play Plants versus Robots, on my phone.." said Mijo to himself, as he stared at the stage.

"Or—or.. Maybe some abyss monsters appear and.. wait, no… we're not even sure if we get our powers anymore. And with so many people outside.. Haha, I am kinda wondering.. when's.. the.. dance. Huh, I.. uh.. should.. where is she..?" said Mijo to himself, as he looks around and doesn't see Rhida. "Oh, no. Well, I better get going." said Mijo, as he stood up and rushed to the spot near the CR's Rhida was talking about.

"Uh.. is she here? Oh, that's definitely _her_." muttered Mijo to himself as he approached Rhida standing at the spot, waiting for him. "H—hey! So, what did you want to talk about..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was silent for a while before answering, "H—honestly.. I don't know.. And, I feel like I should say this now rather than any other time. Mijo, I've always considered my feelings, but.. throughout all of this, you've been.. silent.. You're not the type to not say anything about you, and who you are. So, as.. much as I don't want to hear it… Mijo.. do you still _love_ me?"

Mijo was silent, he was taken aback, but he knew this was coming. But he understood what she was meaning by this, and answered, "I.. I.. guess I should've known you would say this, haha.. I always wondered.. why.. why can't I love you, or why can't I just turn on the switch and **I'll be all lovey-dovey** and we'll already be _dancing_ on the dance floor… I thought this par would change something, if I experience something different I would feel it, but.. nothing. But it's not like I **don't care** about it, no.. even worse.. I obsess over it, without the love part. I've always been thinking, am I _attached_ to you, because _you_ said so, and so I shall.. or did I decide to 'try' because I got my opportunity..? I don't know, I don't know.. These _complicated_ emotions, especially with the dark world problems.. I just feel that if I say yes, would I be staying true to myself? You would want me to be me, right? But I don't know **who is me**, anyway. I've been struggling to think about it over school and dark world matters.. So, do I _love_ you? I… I.. guess _not_, then.." answered Mijo, before looking at a wall, trying to avoid Rhida's gaze, as he is filled with dread, sadness and confusion.

"I—is that so..? You didn't… But.. why.. and.. sigh I.. have to.. excuse myself. Sorry, Mijo." said Rhida, as she rushed away to another private spot in the school. "I knew it.. This day would come. Just.. I wish.. ugh.. It's all gone now, I.. should've just said it to her straight, I.. sigh it's all gone. Haha.. I guess, even when your dreams come true, there's still conflict." muttered Mijo to himself, as he was seen by Urda, looking for him.

"Oh? You're here? Uh.. Guess here goes **nothing**." said Urda to herself as she went over to Mijo. "Oh, w—what.. Are you here to bring me the _second_ breakup..? Just.. _speak_." said Mijo, as he also avoids Urda's gaze. "H—huh? What happened..? I.. uh.. guess this is a bad time.." responded Urda, as Mijo continued, ""Yes, it's always a bad time.. Now, if you don't have anything to say.. leave me alone."

"Hey? What's with the.. **attitude**..? Oh no, I see. I'll.. uh.. l—leave.. then." said Urda, realizing the implication, seeing Rhida leave earlier, with tears in her eyes. "**Stay**. You look like you have some important things to say, so say it now. Don't delay it." said Mijo, now gaining some semblance of toughness to Urda. "Oh, y—you know what, bro.. I think my statement is—" responded Urda, before Mijo, now turning to face Urda, trying to hold his emotions together, and interrupts, "Do it. Any semblance of my emotional stability is gone, so carry on."

"Uh.. ok.. umm… Now.. I completely forgot what I was going to say.. Shit.. Uh.. Hmm… I am sorry that whatever my mess is, you're dealing with it now.. But, uh.. Honestly dude.. I don't know what you two have been through but.. me? I have only realized one thing, I am just.. afraid of losing you. N—not in a romantic way! I think.. But, even with new people in new sections.. I've always gravitated to you, no matter how different we are. Is that why we're best friends? I don't know.. But, I've only realized this after two instances of us almost being separated forever, at least at the time.. Is that, I just don't wanna lose everyone again, not like my life before.. You, my bro.. Symbolize how I liked having true bonds with my friends, and no care for that lovey-dovey stuff, to others.. Especially when we first met, we may seem like a couple but.. we're just best friends, united in.. gaming.. haha.. Um, I get ya.. Having alone time is precious, so.. I'm going to leave. Oh and the speeches are about to end.. I think. Goodbye!" said Urda, as she left with a more happy expression than when she first saw Mijo.

"Haha.. Ok.. ok.. Just.. a lot… Ok, so.. Urda.. Urda.. Ok, I see.. My thoughts have been swirling around her but I realize.. yes.. Ok, we are good friends. That's good. She.. understands I guess. And for Rhida.. I don't know.. It's not done yet. If it was, she would've said so. She needs her private space, and so do I. I.. ok.. So, ok.. I can return to my seat." said Mijo as he starts walking back, hiding his emotions as he looks around the school.

He finally makes it to his seat, as the rest of his classmates clap at the end of the speech. He looks around to see Urda half-asleep, Rhida still gone, Ikari using her phone and Lauvielle talking to someone else. He feels a sense of relief but stays vigilant, wary of the situation unfolding.

Meanwhile at Rhida's spot at some benches that were near a school store. Rhida is seen crying to herself as she tries to keep herself composed to not draw attention to her. "Why.. why.. is he..? ugh… I.. can't believe it.. Is.. everything a lie? Was he just manipulating me? But.. why? I've never actually seen him laugh, and barely a smile or two.. He was always so.. numb? Like, he was a mixture of seriousness, coldness, or always on the verge of bursting tears or anger.. D—did I do anything wrong? I don't know.. We never properly solved our issues during the fallout between the months.. Always giving excuses to Jomi.. I was.. so distraught of myself to lie to Jomi, just so I don't see him. That.. deal? A way of me maneuvering so that I don't have to face him, but no matter what.. Ugh.. But.. even then.. I.. just wish that I got over it, one slip up and now I am trying to pursue someone that.." said Rhida, as she realized something and gasped, before sighing.

 "I.. is that.. forceful? I don't think so.. But, even then.. He's likely back to his seat, drinking away his sorrows.. He always told me that if he ever had a student night he would spend the night eating and drinking.. But, would he want a dance? Does he like to? I don't get it. He says he doesn't love me, but.. why do I always feel like he's looking at me while I am not.. I've talked to my friends, it seems that he doesn't divulge much to them too.. So, does he think it's one-sided? Does he want to reciprocate it? I.. don't understand how.. someone that you love and that they apparently love you, just.. doesn't? He doesn't hate me.. But, rather.. he's scared of me, because he's compassionate, and a selfless guy but.. he can often devolve himself and put too much to his back. I.. didn't know that this is how you break something up. But.. then again.. I can't just cry here… I have to talk to him. It was a shock to him, so he quickly defended and rationalized his attitude but.. it'd be better if dialogue happened. After all, it's a night of fun.." continued Rhida, before she sighed again brushing her hair.

"But.. clearly the two of us aren't having fun, so.. one more talk. Then.. I can finally stop this tension and distance between us." said Rhida to herself as a lot of students pass by her. Then she decides to go back to her seat. She intentionally didn't look at Mijo's direction as she sat down.

"Good job with the exams, may your test scores be high and honor before excellence! God is good, all the time!" said the principal before he exited the stage. "That was a great speech by our great and honorable principal! Anywho, let the night start! The dance floor is now, officially open!" announced the announcer on the stage as the rest of the students start going to the dance floor, while pop music plays in the background.

"Oh it's starting. Well, time to go to the foods and drinks section. Hopefully they have the.. IntelC++ drinks, the orange and lemon ones.. specifically." said Mijo, as he stood up, got his bag and went to the school cafeteria, where they were selling a bunch of hotdog sticks and juice drinks. "Thank you." said Mijo as he paid ₱75 for a big hotdog stick and a bottle of IntelC++ lemon version.

He sat down near a couple of chairs and tables, and coincidentally Ikari was there, checking her phone. "Oh hey, what you doing here? I thought you had like.. someone to.." said Mijo, as he looked at Ikari with a sad expression. "Oh, nothing.. Just.. some broken friendships.. That's all.." sarcastically said Ikari, as Mijo became concerned. 'O—oh? Uh.. That's.. really unfortunate.." said Mijo, now reflecting on the previous events. "Yeah, you don't know her though. We were best friends before, but.. well, I wanted to dance with her.. But, she.. had a different.. plan of her own." explained Ikari with a stern tone. "I see.. What are you doing now?" said Mijo, as he stood up and finished his food.

"I don't know.. You said to be vigilant so, I am staying here for at least a while.. But, whenever that happens, I guess I'll be ready." responded Ikari, as Mijo began drinking, then saying "Well, this could just be a.. normal day. Aside from the monster earlier. I am sure that, nothing will—" said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida coming to his position. "Will what? Look dude, every time you say that something bad happens.." remarked Urda, as Mijo stayed silent looking at Rhida.

"Oh hey guys! Ikari, Mijo! How's it been?" asked Lauvielle, as Mijo continued to ignore the others. "Terrible, how about you? You seem to have succeeded in your dance with Leviente." responded Ikari, as she pointed to Leviente speaking to his friends. "It's going well.. Not sure, what he's up to. 'One final time' he says. I am always not sure what his riddles and cryptic jokes always mean." answered Lauvielle, as she noticed Mijo's silence. "Hey Mijo, how about you? You won our bet. I 'danced' with him. Your 5₱.. next week? Hopefully before the end of the year.." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as he snapped out of his trance and Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah.. Haha.. That's what I call, 'motivation'."

"Well, how about that dark world danger that is constantly looming over us..? Any updates? Sorry, my phone's at like 16% so I don't want to open it.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari quickly responded, "If the others aren't stupid, there shouldn't be anything happening yet." as she checked her phone.

"Good, cause.. I have to talk to someone." said Mijo, as he points to Rhida approaching the group as Ikari and Lauvielle notice. "Ohh ok. Yeah imma go to the others, see you!" said Lauvielle as she left and Ikari responded, "Oh ok. I'll be alone here then." said Ikari, as she put on her earbuds to avoid eavesdropping.

"Hi, there.. What do you want..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked at him with a neutral expression, trying to hide her crying from earlier. "I.. want to talk about the.. love thing. Do you feel a—anything when you talk to me? Just, I need to know.." asked Rhida, as Mijo is trying to form his words properly. "I know you don't want me to go, but please.. this is the only way we can reconcile.." explained Rhida again, as Mijo is still thinking about what to say.

"Oh no.. Ah! Sorry.. But, Urda just sent an urgent message, there's a dark world opening at the place. You know what it is, come on. She said that magic is mixing into our world so we can use our weapons!" said Ikari, as she ran quickly to the ruins of the demolished area. "Of course.. Well.. let's go." remarked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they ran to follow Ikari.

"Hey! What are these guys doing here?! Isn't Jomi supposed to be like.. attacking the abyss monsters?! What are they doing here?!" shouted Urda, as the three arrived around the same time seeing monsters with blades and saws slowly rising from the ground. " don't know?! I was honestly surprised by earlier! But now.." responded Mijo, as they all summoned their weapons to fight the monsters. "We have a chance." said Mijo, as he charged straight at the enemy as the rest followed and supported him with ranged attacks.

He sliced through the monsters with ferocious intent and the outpour of his emotions in his battle form is clearly shown as he battles a big abyss monster with two big shields in its hands. "Ice Shock!"  shouted Rhida, as ice flew from her hands protecting Mijo from the rest of the abyss monsters. "My power is absolute!" said Mijo, as he dashed through space and slowed down time, striking the enemy with carefully placed slashes as he sheathed his blade, causing glass to shatter around him. "Mijo! You know that our ultimates—" shouted Urda as she shot her two pistols as fast as possible, while dodging around with the wind. "Yeah— I know.. But we don't need to last a long time, just enough for others to get here." responded Mijo, as he tried to focus on his movement. "Have you guys ever fought someone outside of the dark worlds?! It's.. rough!" said Ikari, as she tries to not die, as she shoots her rifle at the enemy while running away against the other enemies.

"Once or twice.." answered Mijo, as he parried an attack from the big shield guy then he counterattacked with a jump to a mid-air plunge attack, knocking the big guy. "I am surprised that my—" said Mijo, before he was cut by the right part of his abdomen, knocking him back and his glasses to the ground. "Winter.. Storm!" shouted Rhida, freezing all available enemies as the others cleaned up. "Don't worry.. I am still here.. Just, a bit knocked up!" said Mijo, with a chuckle as he regained his footing and put his glasses in his pockets. "They might break, but.. I got no choice… My power.. shall be absolute!" said Mijo, as he does his ultimate again, taking out all abyss monsters in the area including the big guy as he fell on his knees almost falling down, but managing to barely hold on.

"Mijo are you fine?!" shouted Rhida, as she went closer to Mijo. "Where are the others?!" questioned Ikari, as she also went to Mijo. "Watch out! Second wave!" shouted Urda, as monsters spawn around them and the abyss monsters managed to stab the other two, Rhida and Ikari. "Agh! What?!" screamed Ikari, as she was dragged by the blades of an abyss monster. "Ah! I—is this what pain.. feels like..?" said Rhida, as she was also dragged away by an abyss monster. "Mijo! Rhida! Ikari! Shit, shit.. I am trying to help! Hold on!" shouted Urda as she maneuvered around trying to get to the other three. "I.. need to help.. Agh! But.. why.." said Mijo, as he was wrapped around by random tentacles.

"I got you! Shit— Agh! Oof…" said Urda, as she was knocked by an abyss monster to the ground as she was near Mijo. "To live.. Ugh.. I must.. agh!?! What is this? I.. remember this.. abyss power.." said Mijo, as his energy was being corrupted by abyss magic. "I can't think straight.. My vision.. It knows.. it can't kill me, but.. ugh.. Ah..!" said Mijo as he tried to break out with little change. "Euphoria..? What.. is it doing..?" muttered Mijo, as his mind is swirling around, barely holding on to keep his sanity alive. "Ugh.. Just.. I guess.. this is worse.. than death…" said Mijo, as a mix of happiness and dizziness took over his mind fully and he was dropped down by the tentacle abyss monster.

"Mijo? Mijo?!" said Urda, as Mijo is holding a sword that is not his, and with ripped clothes, almost like he was forcefully dragged by the monster to inject its magic. "Mijo? For the love of god.. Rhida and Ikari are here.. Don't.. kill us.." bargained Urda, as she prepared her blade for a potential fight. "What?! He really gonna turn on us now?!" said Ikari, as she was healed by Rhida. "N—no.. That's not him. He's.." responded Rhida, before sighing as the other two stood off. "That.. tentacle monster.. It's worse than trying to kill us, it's trying to corrupt us.. But.. How.. with him.." muttered Urda to herself, as she prepared her wind blades.

"Damn.. where the fuck are the others?! We've been fighting for the past hour..! And now, fuckin Mijo is about to kill us!!" shouted Ikari as she tried to get up and run away. "Fuck this, I better get help. As I have already seen, he's gonna fuckin' kill us if he tries." said Ikari, as she runs from the place but then she gets stopped by an unknown barrier as she is knocked to the ground. "What? Fuck, we're dead.." said Ikari, as Rhida also notices that she hit a barrier that traps them in the area.

"N—no.. Then, what's happening with the others? If we're trapped since earlier, then we wouldn't have been able to notice anything else happening outside.." remarked Rhida, as Mijo jumps to pluge on the group. "Watch out!" shouted Urda as she teleported near the others to deflect his plunge as he was knocked back on his feet. "These monsters, and Mijo.. We might have to defeat them.." said Urda, as she stood guard to protect Rhida, as Ikari quickly moved behind Urda, panicking internally. "Imma be real, we are not winning.." said Ikari, as she pointed her guns to the other monsters surrounding them. "But.. I am not dying like a bitch." said Ikari, as the other two also attacked the monsters, with Urda focusing at Mijo.

Urda clashed with Mijo, mirroring their spars. Mijo is the first one to strike by using dark magic to blast her back as a large strike, as she deflected it however she was pushed back by a bit. Then Mijo followed up with multiple slashes as Urda dodges easily and manages to get close to Mijo to attack him, but he blasted her away with dark magic, this time knocking her back from him by a lot. She got up and realized that the blast had damaged her clothes and was noticeably hurting more than normal. But she had to quickly focus at Mijo walking at her menacingly, as she ran to face him again.

As she was about to clash blades with him, he suddenly dodges away from her and to Rhida. "What?! Hey!" shouted Urda, as she looks at Mijo surprise Rhida with an attack shattering her ice wall and knocking her back as Urda managed to get a hit on Mijo on his arm. He was unfazed then he knocked her back. "Don't worry! I got this!! **FUUCK YOU!!!**" screamed Ikari, as her gun overloads to launch a large flame projectile towards Mijo. As the flame engulfs it's surroundings, Ikari is slowly walking back from the destruction before being surprised by a seemingly fire-immune Mijo striking her, blowing her back to a wall knocking her down.

"Ugh.. Fuck.. Damn.. why did he had to be turned to the dark side.. I swear.. if any one of us were turned, it would've been quite easy.." muttered Ikari, as the flame dissipates, revealing the damage to the others due to their location near the explosive range. "Oh... They're also damaged.. Huh.. can never.. seem to get it right.." remarked Ikari, as she looks at the other two on the ground. Mijo approaches her with a determined look as she looks over to him. "Hey.. is this the part where you kill me?! Just.. get it over with.. I am tired." said Ikari, as she looks at him, completely determined but clearly not in control, as his eyes now glow with purple. As he was about to raise his blade, Rhida managed to blast ice to Mijo, getting his attention. "H—hey! You'll not ruin a single life anymore!" shouted Rhida as she was floating with ice all around her. "I might have been holding back, but Mijo wouldn't want us to, so.. this is.. WINTER STORM!" shouted Rhida as a blizzard from out of nowhere is summoned as Mijo focused at Rhida launching multiple slashes all being blocked by a huge ice wall.

"Ugh.. well.. fuck me.." muttered Ikari, as she layed down on the ground, seeing the impending doom. "Oh no.. This.. is not good.. She'll.. agh..!" said Urda as she tries to stumble her way to Rhida, but falling to the ground head first. "Ugh.. This.. is suicide. Hah, guess that's why they're a couple haha.. ugh.. Goodbye world.." said Urda as she stared at Rhida preparing her ultimate. "ETERNAL STORM!" shouted Rhida as she launched the blizzard freezing all living beings, as she drops down to the floor. "I.. can't believe it.. he's still.. there." said Rhida, as she sees a Mijo covered in ice but moving towards her, walking slowly. "My.. power.. I.. ugh.. there's nothing else we can do.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with his blade pointed at her. As Mijo walks up to her, his blade maintained pointed at her, as she closes her eyes for the inevitability of death. But as she waited, she could feel no blade touch her, so she opened her eyes a bit to see his blade shaking. "What.. Is he.. hesitating..? Is he.. breaking out..?" remarked Rhida as she looks at his blade then to his eyes, noticeably the left eye was being turned blue from purple, but it was being turned back to purple, like his body and power is being fought by two parties, the corruption and Mijo.

Mijo walks back, as the blade is being turned towards himself. He struggles as he turned his blade towards his heart before stabbing himself. He falls to the ground, as Rhida calls out, "Mijo! NO! Please, please.. live..", while struggling to get to him. He's clearly in pain as he looks at the ground, trying to fight for his body back. "My Mijo.. come back.. Please.. I.. love you.. Ugh.." said Rhida to Mijo, as she succumbed to her injuries and fainted. As he witnesses her close her eyes, he reaches out before being forced back, holding the sword in his heart. He finally broke out as he stood up, but was knocked to the right of his position. He looks and sees a figure that looks similar to him but with the sword that is not his. "Who are you?!" said Mijo, as he manifests his sword out of nowhere with its scabbard. The figure then attacks him, but he dodges and slices the right abdomen of the figure. The figure stumbles as she retaliates with summoning slashes, as the figure reflects it to him, forcing him to dodge. "Like I said, who the fudge are you?! " questioned Mijo, as he summons small blades to attack the figure as he focuses on the figure before the figure gets behind him and manages to get a small cut before Mijo deflects and manages to get a huge wound on the figure's chest. The figure retreats from him and tries to heal herself. The blizzard stops as the area becomes clearer as the other three remain unconscious, now being obvious to Mijo.

"**Explain yourself.** Who are you, and.. why do you exist?" said Mijo with spite, as the figure finally looks at him, revealing her face. "Oho.. A *doppelganger* huh? A corrupted version, well.. of course.." remarked Mijo, as he stares down at his doppelganger. "Oho? Yeah, and might be your.. **darkest, deepest desires..** Mijo~" said the gender-bent doppelganger with a smile and a wink. "What should I call you.. Jomi? No.. you don't deserve a name." said Mijo, mocking the doppelganger, as the doppelganger smiles and says, "No need. I have my own name, I'm sure you have met me before, *Mijo Cala.* I'm *Cara.* **Cara, the Abyss Queen**. **Cara Loreimur.**"

"Nonsense. Cara has died a long time ago. You're probably a remnant, a weakened reverberation of the original. So, I'll finish off this legacy of *Cara.* Let's dance." said Mijo, as the two faced off, waiting for the other to attack first. "You are *inherently weaker now*, I've took some of your.. power, and I'm planning on taking **all.**"said Cara, as she mocked Mijo, noticing his magic is less powerful than she expected.  "I'll still beat you, by myself. I only need my perseverance and will. You are nothing but an abyss remnant stealing from me." responded Mijo, as the two glared at each other intently. "*Weakling. Pathetic. Scum.*" said Cara, as she attacked first, crossing blades with Mijo.

Mijo retreats and keeps a defensive stance as Mijo says to himself, "Damn it.. she's right.. This split is affecting me a lot, I can't use my magic properly.. While she seems to be unaffected.." as Cara smiles menacingly and attacks him, making him deflect but forcing him to lose further ground to the wall. "Damn. My offense is limited, I wonder if.. **they** can still fight?" said Mijo, as he intentionally starts hurling a bunch of slashes as he moves to the left to get to Urda. "What? Trying to revive your friends? Haha.. Even if you got all three, you would still *lose* to me." said Cara, as she kept parrying his slashes.

"It doesn't hurt to try!" said Mijo, as he got to Urda, covered in snow and unconscious. "Oh it will.. Such is the way of the light." said Cara, as she stops attacking to see Mijo attempt to wake Urda up. "Stardust Crusader.. May you stand again and fight for yourself.." said Mijo, as he heals Urda, noticeably hurting himself in the process. "What is this.." questioned Mijo, as he continued healing Urda, persevering through the pain. "You'll see very soon.. Haha.." responded Cara, as Mijo finished and he walked back a bit as Urda woke up. "What.. Mijo? and.. Jomi?! Shit.. which one of you isn't corrupted?!" questioned Urda, as she sees Mijo from the right and Cara to the left.

"No need to scrutinize." said Cara, as she quickly attacks her, forcing Mijo to defend her position, pushing Cara back, but weakening Mijo a bit. "Mijo?! Who the heck is that Jomi clone?!" questioned Urda, as she stood up and summoned her weapons. "No clue. Just.. ugh.." said Mijo, before he fell to his knees, succumbing to the pain a bit. "Mijo?! Damn you.. whoever you are, so.. you've been the one hurting my friends?!" questioned Urda to Cara, as she laughs maniacally and says sardonically, "Haha!! Here I am once again.. Got a problem?" said Cara, as Urda jumps to attack her but Cara manages to reflect her, forcing her back on her feet. 

She ran to Mijo and said, "Mijo?! Are you fine?! Hold on, I have some—". before Mijo quickly rejects her potions of healing and says, "No.. go to the others.. And revive them instead. I'll handle her." said Mijo, as he stood up and was still shaking as he ran to attack Cara. "Got it." said Urda, as she ran to a nearby Rhida. He attacks Cara, as Cara easily defends and manages to push him back using a dark blast. "I'll fight.. my own path! You.. whoever you are.. shall *die!*" shouted Mijo, as he relentlessly attacked Cara, while Cara smiled all the way, not even trying sometimes. Meanwhile Urda is healing Rhida, and Rhida wakes up and asks, "Huh..? What.. happened?"

"Mijo is fighting a Jomi clone while I am trying to heal us back, you got any consumables with you?" answered Urda, as Rhida smiles and responds, "I—I think so.. Is.. Mijo going to be fine?", as she gives Urda some health snacks and drinks. "I.. uh.. to be honest.. I don't know. He's uh.. doing fine, but.. it's clear he's.. in pain, a lot. Like way too much, something that an emo person would dream of haha.." responded Urda, as she heals Rhida enough so she could stand up. "Uh.. I.. understand. Let's heal Ikari, then we'll help him." said Rhida, as they ran to Ikari's position. 

"My my.. Getting restless, are we?" mocked Cara, as Mijo maintained his battle stance, and responds, "Yeah, what about it? I am not giving up, ever." "Sure, sure.. You might not be giving up, but your magic, your ___power___ is fading.. It's only a matter of time hehe.. That is why I don't need to fight you. Then, my ***power*** is also increasing with it, like.. transfering the better authority to me." said Cara, as Mijo tries to focus at fighting but he knows that what Cara is saying is true. "Even so. My friends are here, and they hold no mercy for you. Especially when I am here." responds Mijo, as Cara maniacally laughs and says, "We shall see.. But we know the end. Your friends dead, disintegrated and you having to submit to me, **fully.**"

Rhida and Urda come up to Ikari and they heal her, "Woah! Ugh.. This.. is.. my weapon, and you two are Urda and Rhida.. Is this the afterlife?" asked Ikari, as the other two helped her get up. "No. You might even say it's still hell.." answered Urda, as she points to the duel between Mijo and Cara. "Oh! I see Mijo has broken out, but who is he fighting?" asked Ikari, as Rhida responds, "She's a... Jomi clone. Let's help Mijo." as they ran to Mijo's position.

"Agh... Fuck.. I am so.. **angry** at you, but ugh.. no matter what, I can't win.." said Mijo, after getting knocked back by Cara as she easily outpowered Mijo when they crossed blades. "Haha.. That's it.. Embrace the anger, embrace it!" responded Cara, as she continued attacking Mijo, forcing Mijo to defend until a surprise attack from Urda caused Cara to retreat back. "You will stop hurting Mijo ___now!___" said Urda, as she glared down Cara with wind around her getting stronger. "Oho? Your friends are back.. that's nice.. Then.. this will prove my new strength, you didn't need anyone, haha~" responds Cara, as she transforms his true sword into a massive broadblade that is now filled to the brim with Mijo's and abyss magic. "*Let's dance.*" said Cara, as she laughs maniacally.

"*Golden Wind!*" said Urda, as she unleashed her ultimate, moving at lightspeed making Cara parry all her slashes, but now being vulnerable to the shots by Urda and her burning rock projectiles and Rhida's ice making her movement worse forcing her back. "Combined Assault? You learn that after your defeat? How pathetic, you were only a given second chance." said Cara, as she jumped in the air and headed for Ikari, forcing Urda to stop her mid-air using her wind, so that Ikari can charge her gun to fire a large burning projectile to knock her back to the ground. Then Rhida used her ice gain to restrict his movement, this time with an intense blizzard being directed to Cara. "Haha.. Even so.. You shall die!" shouted Cara, as she unleased her sword at light speed, making the other three easily hit by Cara, damaging the three of them. "I can also use speed too now, Urda! The best part? I only need to use it **twice.**" said Cara, as she smirked and stopped to look at the three getting up. 

"Ugh.. I can't take it.. anymore.. My mind wants to continue but my body is.. fading.." said Urda, as she looks at Cara standing there, looking at her. "Ugh.. I.. if I use.. it again.. I''ll not survive another day. She's.. right, ugh." said Rhida, as she heard Urda's words. "Whew.. I guess.. uh.. I am gonna die again, soo fun." responded Ikari to the other two, as she struggles to handle her gun due to her injuries. 

"I.. can't stay.. like this. I can't give up yet, there is a light that has been buried." said Mijo, as he stood up again, with pain and suffering at every second he remains determined and motivated. "Through vacant halls, I won't surrender!" shouted Mijo, as he ran to face Cara. "Oho? Stop in your fantasies, my Mijo.. I am sure we both know what's the outcome." responded Cara, as Mijo stopped and glared at her. "Forsakened in this, I am awakened.. ***I AM HERE TO RECLAIM MY NAME!***" said Mijo before charging straight at Cara, attacking and defending as much as he can, testing Cara a bit. "If you want your power, then come try and take it!" said Cara, as she defended against Mijo's barrage of attacks. "I will." answered Mijo, as he dodged and parried all attacks of Cara, with neither of them getting hits in each other. 

"Look.. He's still fighting.. I.. can't give up yet.. I must stay determined." said Urda, as she observes the battle and uses her powers to maintain her footing and launches herself into the air to unleash a barrage of slashes at Cara. "This is fun. No distractions—" said Cara, before getting hit by Urda. Mijo instantly attacks and manages to get a lot of hits before Cara manages to stop Mijo, but the damage was already done. "Ugh.. Of course.. only when you get your so-called motivation, you get a few hits.." said Cara, before Mijo followed with a barrage of slashes forcing Cara to dodge.

"Ah? Is that.. Urda? and.. Mijo? I.. have to.. help them. No matter what happens, even if.. ugh.." said Rhida, as Ikari stood up and shouted, "Hah! You're getting beat by the power of friendship! It starts with this!" as she blasted Cara with a lot of burning projectiles like arrows, rocks and bullets, all headed to Cara. "I.. hmmm.. Let's do it." said Rhida, as she looks at Cara, struggling to maintain her composure as she dodges the attacks from the other two while trying to parry and counter attack Mijo's attacks. "Here it goes.." she says, as she looks at Mijo another time. "I am sorry.. ___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouts Rhida, as she floats and her eyes turn white as a huge blizzard starts forming.

"Oh no.." said Urda as she witnessed Rhida charging her ultimate. "Huh? Wow.. ok..?" reacted Ikari, as she looked at Rhida floating with wind and snow swirling around them. Mijo looks at Rhida and realizes what he has to do. "A storm is approaching.. There's only one thing I should do. **_I shall be the storm that is approaching._**" declared Mijo, as he used the last of his lightning magic to influence the blizzard causing it to be even more extreme and chaotic than ever before.

"What a show.. Let's see if it pays off.. Hah?" said Cara, as she claps and looks at the huge blizzard and thunderstorm mix slowly forming. "Huh?! Mijo?!  What are you—" said Rhida, as she noticed Mijo influencing the storm. "Do it, now!" shouted Mijo, as he's barely holding the storm and himself together. "Ah— Ok!" responded Rhida, as she unleashed the blizzard-storm mix, decimating everything in its path as everything is swallowed inside as everyone's vision fades to black.

Mijo wakes up in a familiar dark space, with a figure in front of him turned their back so familiar yet different. "What.. happened?" asked Jomi, as he recognizes her voice and is relieved as he stands up again. "I.. uh.. honestly.. I don't know.. I was.. too busy with my.. I mean— the party, to figure out anything happening.. I just followed my heart, and my mind.. So many things happened in the blink of an eye.. I am.. overwhelmed." answered Mijo, as he sat down on the floor, contemplating.

"You're lucky again, y'know? After hearing that, I.. am not surprised by what I saw. Did you know you were fighting in the dark world? That _abyss doctor_.. He found a way to.. disrupt our life **again**." explained Jomi as she turned to face Mijo, revealing her tattered and battered look, seeing as her clothes were cut and torn due to battle. "What.. happened..? to you, I mean." asked Mijo as she looked somewhere else, looking conflicted. "I.. think we should focus on you first. Let me set a scene, me and my guards saw three bodies and traces of abyss magic. Who were you fighting, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo tries to remember the  chaotic events earlier.

"Uhuh.. Well.. mm... They were definitely abyss monsters. They seem organized and controlled by someone, likely a subordinate of the _doctor_.." answered Mijo, as he remembers the previous events and is intentionally choosing his words. "I see.. It's as expected.. So, tell me.. Mijo, why do the most concentration of abyss magic trace back to **you?**" questioned Jomi, with her eyes narrowed to Mijo's trying to not look at her. "Uh haha... Uh.. I.. don't uh.. understand.." responded Mijo, nefore Jomi unsheathed her sword to point it at Mijo, as Mijo walks back a bit and looks at a Jomi, who now has a more tense facial expression. "Explain yourself, or else." said Jomi, as Mijo held back his magic to not provoke Jomi and answered, "I.. ugh.. It.. starts with right after I went home." as Jomi sheathes her sword and says, "Go on."

"Well.. All I can say is, uh.. well there's this dream, and I was.. like walking around, then I saw.. well, you know how we're kinda familiar? Well, I saw myself as a girl. I know you're also like the gender-bent clone of me, but this one's different, she has more of my modern characteristics. Uh.. this is related because.."  explained Mijo, before struggling to say the words that won't make him look bad. "What? I don't understand, I know you have certain fantasies about me, what does that have to do with the *abyss magic*? I **need** to know, you're **barely alive,** kept alive by me to figure out the details." interrupted Jomi, as Mijo was shocked at these words and remarked, "Huh..? Am I gonna die? Like.. for real? Is this my dying consciousness or something?"

"Not exactly." Jomi sighs as she looks around and sits down next to her. "To be honest, yeah, you were about to die when I saw you three. Your body has been beaten so many times, more than the others actually. It doesn't help that the sword you were holding broke, likely in the battle. I am.. keeping you alive, as always. I knew that you were most likely the biggest catalyst of any potential surge of intense magic, at least.. not *abyss ones.*" answered Jomi, as Mijo was relieved and responds, "Whew.. I.. survive another day. Uh.. want me to continue?" as Jomi nods and Mijo continues, "Well, she looked like the woman that called herself, *'Cara.'*" before Jomi gasped and responded, "What?! Cara?! I.. thought we killed her?"

"Ugh.. I don't know anymore. She seemed to be at least a part of her." explained Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "I guess.. she.. uh.. she seemed too powerful.. and the abyss doctor exists, there's a possibility that she might have been awakened by him due to her.. capabilities." Mijo nodded and sighed as he slumped over the dark wall behind him. "Well.. now we know that the abyss doctor has plans with using her now."

Jomi brushed her hair, stretched her arms and remarked, "Yeah.. That's not good, without a pawn that can betray him, like me before with Cara.. Who knows what that doc' will do?"  Mijo quickly responded, "Wait! I.. you questioned me about how I got the *abyss powers,* yes?"
before Jomi raised one of her eyebrows, and looked away, blushing a bit. "Oh. Yeah, you should also know that we found an abyss sword nearby, is that.. what Cara held?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo expressed disappointment at himself.

"I.. Yes. She did. I.. basically got influenced by whatever they did to me when they trapped me, I broke out of it and fought Cara, however she held my true sword, while I held an inferior backup sword that managed to last." answered Mijo, as Jomi thought about it for a while, perusing her mind for a resoponse. "I've always wondered how you lasted, but.. I assumed whatever magic that sword was being held up by finally disipated when you got knocked out. The abyss sword had traces I had to.. look over, and.. uh.. well yeah you need a new katana, Mijo. That one is now a full-fledged abyss magic-infused sword. I might use it, or you, depends." 

"Yeah, I guess I might, but my recovering magic might not be able to take it.. I'll pass for now, I'll figure out a way to defend myself." responded Mijo, as Jomi quickly adds, "Well, okay then Mijo, I'll just give you it, if you would like to use it, I don't mind, I just want to see how it works."

"Okay, I will make sure then. L—let's move on." said Mijo, as he stops for a moment to recollect his thoughts before continuing, "Then to defeat Cara again, we had to launch a powerful blizzard—thunderstorm attack, and amplified by **my** use of my friend's magic, I didn't realize it but then I saw that I was also grabbing aero and fire magic to mix in, resulting in the most chaotic, destructive and powerful storm I've ever seen.." explained Mijo, as Jomi stayed silent for quite a while, before responding, "Hmm.. I think I get the plan of the **_abyss doctor_**. To make sure he succeeded, he distracted me. Then he attacked your party, using Cara.. Surprising you at your weakest, and by doing this he can try to gain control of a powerful enemy, as well as weaken a strong one. He's likely planning something bigger, again. All we can do is to prepare for the worst."

"Uh.. when will he do something again?" asked Mijo as Jomi quickly responded, "I don't know. I saw signs of his presence but he wasn't present for the battles. Just.. enjoy the rest of your night." Mijo stood up and questioned, "Cool, how do I revive again?" before Jomi answered, "Stay here. I'll leave and revive you fully, you're going to wake up in the dark world though, you need to close the fountain first."

"Oh yeah, well.. see you, Jomi." responds Mijo, as Jomi nodded and opened a portal as she looked at him one more time before heading out. Then as he looked around, suddenly he couldn't stop himself from dropping to the floor, as he woke up and saw the dark fountain. He looked around to see Jomi healing the other lightners, as he looked back at the dark fountain.

"I guess, I should close it then." muttered Mijo to himself as he went near the dark fountain and closed it as light took over his vision. He woke up at the light world laying down at the ruins of the building they went to. He stands up, noticing that his body was more weak when he entered and he quickly wore his glasses, before looking at his friends, all slowly waking up. 

"Hey.. So.. the abyss threat has been neutralized for now, the **real**  Jomi arrived to support us and we can finally rest for today." said Mijo, as the other three acknowledge Mijo's words in various nods and hums. "Oh, finally.. Damn that girl took a while, how about the others, Lauvielle.. JR?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle, Leviente, Jamise and JR arrived at their location. "We're here! Uh.. where's the enemy?" said Lauvielle, as Mijo, Rhida, Ikari and Urda look at her.

"You guys arrived late, we.. dealt with it." responded Urda, as the newly arrived lightners all express forms of disappointment. "Woah no way.. We fought through hundreds of monsters, and.. huh? Our weapons, they just disappeared?!" said Jamise, as she realizes her wooden staff is gone as all the others notice their weapons couldn't be summoned anymore.

"Oh, right. We were flashed by a huge light before getting our footing and going here. That's probably the closure of the dark world we fell on." explained JR. "Mhmm.. All we saw and heard was a huge explosion, we assumed that was the dark world and started heading but then we saw a bunch of abyss monsters appear around us, we couldn't leave the unconscious people be potentially threatened so we stayed to fight them." added Leviente, as the others processed the statement, "Although, they seem that they were targeting us.. It's weird, why didn't the others get dark world magic?" commented Jamise, as she narrowed her eyes a bit.

"This was a bit different than normal dark world explosions, but it hasn't been the same since the intramurals.. Maybe the ***abyss order*** are trying something different?" responded Mijo. "There's nothing we **can** do anyway." said Rhida, before Mijo whispered to her something. "Oh..? Mijo mentioned to me that as of right now, the ***abyss*** can't and likely won't do anything, at least.. according to Jomi." remarked Rhida, as the various ligthners agree at Rhida's statement, some more happy than the others. "Well, at least we got to fight. I see that as a win!" exclaimed Jamise, her enthusiastic energy being recieved by others differently, ranging from that same excitedness to a slight amusement at her statement. 

"Well, I guess that's that.. I am sure y'all have your own things to do, so the world is *saved!* again.. see you. " said Mijo, before everyone separates from the group, with only Rhida staying behind. "So.." said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida looking at some rocks, averting his gaze. "Uh.." continued Mijo, trying to come up with a word to say to Rhida as she stays silent. After a while, Rhida sighs and says, "Answer the question, Mijo." She finally gets the courage to look at Mijo again trying to keep a neutral face. "I.. I know. *sigh* Look, I.. I am sorry, ok? I just.. can't express love the same way you do. But, to answer.." he stops for a moment, then continues, "Yes. I do. Very much. But.. I can't help myself, I've never really experienced those types of relationships, nor do I have a natural affinity with them. I uh.. have been considering why I have these problems, but.. hmm.. It might be because I haven't experienced it myself, or genetics.. Either way, what I am trying to say is.. I am.. trying, as much as I can."

They are both silent for a minute or two, before Rhida responds, "Ah.. I see..  *sigh* I'd kinda wish that everytime we saw each other we had a fun time.. However, before the dark world.. We'd **never** interact much, I— I don't know why, I just wanted to both connect but at the same time I didn't really know you much, besides your reputation as a computer expert... I just knew that I had something for you; I'd first hide it.. But often, love can't be hidden, so they get.. **revealed**. Soon enough, they'd push me to you, trying to help me overcome my fears and talk to you.. But, nothing really came of it.. I had a few **scares** actually. But it seemed that everytime we talked it was always small and.. like we were just.. classmates. The other times, it seems like you were intentionally trying to get my attention or were standing next to me but then leaving. But.. I'm not the one to pry into anyone's secrets.. I don't know if you remember this, but before the dark world, we had a.. few interactions, that.. genuinely **scared** me that you didn't **reciprocate**.. I am not sure.. what you thought since you were always casual with these things. Since.. school was ending, I was ready to move on but, soon after.. the dark world happened. And, in the following days of that whole starting point, I quickly became attached, especially that first time in that snowy world. Then the feats we did, the accomplishments you boasted, it was.. a **rekindling**. But, after that fateful last day.. I.." she stops herself as she held back tears. Mijo went to her side to comfort her, before he went back after she calmed down a bit.

"I.. couldn't bear you **dying**, and even if you didn't, we would've likely been separated in the future. I.. just.. had to confess right there, before the major battle. But, you looked conflicted, I was.. **horrified** that you were going to reject me but, you just left.. without saying anything. Afterwards, we didn't meet and I didn't see you for quite a while. Even during the next school year, you intentionally avoided me and my presence, it wasn't until the intramurals where we got our first proper conversation, even then.. It was so **short**, it didn't do **anything**. So, now we're here.." continued Rhida, as Mijo listened intently hiding his reactions for now. 

"I see. It wasn't the **best** way to say goodbye, but it made sense at the time.." Mijo sighs, and shakes his head. "I can't **justify** that. After that I couldn't look at you the same way again.. It was embarassing, if I looked at you.. even for a second.. If I did, there was a chance you would look at me, and I.. was.. a coward.. I'd wish that all those times, I just.. manned up and all of it will be solved.. But, like you said we're here. And we might as well enjoy this night." responded Mijo, then he went up to her and hugged her as she did the same, both of them holding each other tightly for quite a while before they pulled back.

"Ok.. ok.. Now uh.. we're done with the emotional stuff.. Let's.." said Mijo, now smiling and relieved.  "Dance? Hehe, as much as I wanted to, I.. don't actually know how to.." responded Rhida, as Mijo chuckled and said, "Me too.. I was planning to drink tons of IntelC++ drinks, if you want to join me, that would be nice."

"I.. would love to, I personally love the pomelo and calamansi flavors." answered Rhida, before they walked out of the area and to the foods and drinks section of the party. They silently marveled the aesthetics of the party, as they silently enjoyed each other's company, getting looks from some of their classmates. They finally got to the place and begin ordering, Mijo and Rhida paying ₱75 and ₱50 respectively. Mijo got a hotdog stick and the orange flavor while Rhida got the pomelo flavor.

They sat down nearby, where Ikari was still checking her phone, where Mijo placed his bag near a bunch of tables. "So.. anything to talk about?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was drinking the juice quietly. "Uh.. no not really.. next exams are far away.. and, research too.. so.. I just.. want to forget about those for a while." responded Rhida, with a sad expression.

"How.. about the results of the current ones, I mean there's two quarters left, but.. eh.. I don't really know what to talk about either." asked Mijo, as he drank more juice. "Uh.. I did good, around 91 average for most of my subjects.. I know uh.. you tend to place lower.. so I didn't want to brag about it." answered Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her statement. "Eh.. You know I don't care much about grades, but I do admit, I do ask other's grades for.. I have no idea, envy? jealousy? motivation?" responded Mijo, as Rhida looked at Mijo. "It's.. natural curiosity.. I guess..." remarked Rhida, before looking away as the two fell silent eating and drinking respectively. 

For a moment, they were listening to the music playing while gazing at the crowd of dancers at the dance floor. They each were thinking of something but they didn't want to share it to the other one. "Ahem.. What's the time.. hehe..?" asked Mijo as he checked himself the time to see it was 21:00 (9:00 PM), an indication of time that is running out. "It's.. 9:00 PM, why do you ask?" questioned Rhida, anticipating something. "Uh.. ok.. so.. why don't we **try** dancing, at least during this night..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and stumbles her words a bit before answering, "Uh.. haha.. uh.. sure..?" as they finished up their meal and decided to go to the dance floor.

They went to the dance floor, holding hands as they looked at the others. Mijo placed his left hand at her right shoulder as he placed his right on her hip, as she does the opposite, right on left and right on his hip. They awkwardly started to sway from side to side as they figured what to do. 

"Uh.. so.. is this how it's done?" asked Mijo, as Rhida shakes her head, not knowing if they are right. "Um.. Well, I don't think.. we.. fit this.." continued Mijo, as they continued their dance. Rhida nods, but they remain swaying left and right. "Y—yeah.. Um.. do you want to continue..?" asked Mijo as they slowly stopped.

"W—why did we.. stop..?" asked Mijo, as he pulled his hand away from Rhida as she does the same. "Hmmm.. I just, have doubts.. about this whole thing.." answered Rhida, as Mijo sadly nodded in agreement, not surprised by her answer. They silently went off the dance floor and went back to their drinks as they sat down together.

Mijo sighs and says, "Well, I was.. thinking about it. I just.. didn't want to push it, we might as well enjoy this night right?" Rhida nodded her head, silently agreeing with his statement. "But.. yeah.. it's only a couple of hours before we go home. And.. afterwards? I am not sure. This is.. one of the only few times we get to meet each other. Even in the dark world, we don't meet.. Eventually, after grade 10.. we might never meet each other again.." continued Mijo, making Rhida start to tear up.

"I.. uh.. ugh.. you don't know how much I wanted you, nor have I ever tried to express it.. I love you, however.. life likes to separate us.  And.. it... agh.. hurts me to say this.. But.." He sighs heavily and begins to stumble on his words. "B—but.. I—I t—think.. w—we.." he fails to make a word as he instead tries to comfort Rhida's emotional turmoil.

"Mmm... I.. eh..  I.. guess I shouldn't— It's ok.. Rhida, please.." said Mijo, as Rhida starts to cry harder. "No.. I am.. sorry.. I am just.. going.. to shut up now." continued Mijo as he tears up a bit but not letting much show, focusing on Rhida instead.

They were comforting each other for a while, focusing on each other while everything around them moves. Ikari is awkwardly shuffling away from them, trying not to disturb the broken couple, while the others were focused on their own nightly escapades. Eventually Mijo decided to speak up.

"Ok.. ok.. so.. mmm.. I.. think we should still.. be together, but understand that.. we might not get a lot of opportunities to be together. Let's make it last until then, you.. good with that?" asked Mijo, as Rhida calmed down a bit and answered, "Mmm.. Yes, yes I am good with that. Haha.."

"Haha, now... Let's.. oh.." said Mijo, before Mijo noticed Ikari go to their spot, with a shy grin. "So.. Hopefully, I wasn't interrupting anything.. But, new dark world just dropped, oxygen room." said Ikari as Mijo and Rhida checked their phones and saw Urda's message at the group chat.

Urda: yooo @everyone I am just about to make another dark world so hopefully you can join me in fighting some abyss monsters!!!! Don't worry this one is made by me so no confusing transitions justtt enter the room!

"Oh. well, ok then. Come on, let's go." said Mijo as the other two followed him to Urda's section classroom. "Well, here goes nothing." muttered Mijo before jumping in with the others, transforming their night wear with a more elegant and battle look, as they landed in a classroom.

"Oh, this is a.. classroom, interesting." remarked Mijo before noticing their new look. "Oh right. Mmm.." says Mijo, as the three of them checked each other's new looks. "Oh wow... I have.. a cool ice queen aesthetic. I even have a diamond tiara!" commented Rhida, as Ikari adds, "Hmm.. I have a.. you know what, it just looks cool to me, ok?"

"We should go outside, Urda's probably waiting for us.." said Mijo before he went outside, the other two following him. Then they notice Urda leaning on the wall beside the door with a gray kimono, a black haori coat and red hakama pants, with maple leaf designs all around.

"Oh? You're finally here. Because.. I've been waiting! I can't just let my friends have no fun in killing some abyss monsters!" exclaimed Urda, point to some abyss monsters nearby as Lauvielle and Leviente appear behind Urda and Rhida. Mijo turns around and notices the two before looking back at Rhida and responding, "Yeah. Let's go." as they headed off to where the monsters are, with Jamise and JR joining.

Mijo summons another random sword he stashed and said, "Hold on, let me make a videogame reference.. *ahem*" He looks at the monsters with his sword positioned to slash through them. "Devils cry, huh? Well, let's hear what that sounds like!" continued Mijo, before stabbing the nearby monsters, alerting the horde.

As the others summon their weapons and begin killing the abyss monsters, Mijo goes near Rhida and says, "Well.. I guess our fate was to stay/night?" as Rhida is unamused by his reference and responds, "Hmm.." then Rhida looks at the monsters, she smirks and continues, "Well, I guess we should have unlimited blade works then." as Mijo smiles and nods as they continue the fight.

## Author's Note: 

WE ARE FUDGING DONE WOOOOO IT'S BEEN WHAT.. 9 MONTHS?! SINCE I STARTED THIS DRAFT AND 5 MONTHS SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THAT OTHER SPINOFF!

I started them both at the same darn time, around the same time, at least. And I finished the spinoff around August, but I floundered with finishing this one until today! At 2025!!! (WHAT THE ACTUAL—) Yeah, I am not letting this one **especially** just not have a story when I wrote it already on a spinoff!! I mean, aside from the transformation (which after much deliberation I have decided to write out, I am going to explain this in a future dev commentary but in '**short**'..);

The reason is, I don't think I developed the transformation thing with the oversight that it will heavily impact the future chapters, and leads to stories that personally, I would rather explore and deviate from the season 2 plotline, like with how I plan to make a spinoff after that **'It's Magic Time!'** spinoff to continue the story, to explore the transformation dynamic more than the wider aspects of the plot that I had previously set up. Basically, I think that the transformation aspect could be better as an alternate storyline or at least something that doesn't affect the main storyline.

I think I set up and developed around how Cara, which by C6S2 references this chapter as the other meet up for them (which was based on IMT) and eventually, C7S2 to C8S2. Anyways, that's all I have to say for now, I know, this is long because this was a long chapter I worked on (Just so you wait, C3S1 will have an entire essay lol) See you soon, goodbye and good day to you, dear reader! 

(Yes I didn't sleep for this)

## Summary: 

Mijo and his friends once again go back to school, this time with a good ol' fashion dark world, with weird rules on language.

————————————————————————————

Mijo goes to school, moving up once again. He goes to school with a more determined and persevering attitude as he faces another randomized section, with people he doesn't know, however some friends remained, specifically Ikari and Lauvielle. With the huge loss of JR, he has to try again to survive school, hopefully take care of the huge plan of the abyss doctor, if he ever reveals himself.

"Ugh.. it's another day.. Tuesday." muttered Mijo to himself as he looked over the balcony, during his lunch time. "I wonder.. is anyone going to open the dark world again?" muttered Mijo as his thoughts wander to the dark world. "Well, we'll just wait and see. I see no reason to dwell on this. Hopefully, if anyone does so.. it better be tomorrow." muttered Mijo, before he left to go recollect his thoughts and walked around the school.

The next day, at a break right around before the last period, Mijo is seen walking around the construction of a new building, the one that was demolished and is now being rebuilt with a second floor.

"A lot has changed.. ever since.. that night. I don't know how to feel about it. So far, I haven't had any.. major stress, for now." said Mijo, before he checked the time. "Oh, I should go back. After MAPEH, it should be.. ugh. CAT." continued Mijo, as he walked to his classroom.

He took in the view of the school one more time, before he went up the stairs and towards his classroom on the second floor. "Oh boy, I wonder.. what's sir going to teach us..?" muttered Mijo, before he opened the door in his classroom, but it was dark. "Uhuh.. another dark world? Who opened this one?" said Mijo, as he stepped back from shock a bit. "Well, my time.. has come. Let's jump in." said Mijo, before he jumped in, landing at an unknown ruined building with his sword sheathed.

"Oh, I am here." said Mijo, as he looked around the destroyed landscape, reminiscent of old worlds. "Huh, ok..." remarked Mijo, before two unknown darkners showed up with their blades. "Quién es? Ah, hmm..." said one of the darkners, checking Mijo out. "Hah? You speak spanish?" questioned Mijo as both of them answered, "Si."

"Um, so you understand English.. so bilingual?" asked Mijo, before the other darkner responded, "Tatlong wika po, Mijo." as Mijo raised his eyebrows and responded, "Wow.. you know my name? Whew... Hmm, tell me. You know where.. the fountain is?" the two men looked at each other before one of them said, "Si, pero primero, permítanos presentarle a nuestro líder." 

"Uh.. first, permit us to.. present our leader? Oh, sure. Vamos, entonces." said Mijo, translating then moving with the darkners to a makeshift building. "Señorito Mijo, nuestro líder está aquí. Nosotros esperaremos afuera." said the darkner as Mijo enters waving goodbye. "Hii!! Who are.. you.." said Mijo, as he realizes he's looking at a Jomi. "Hmph, Mijo? Let's cut the spanish here, or Filipino. Who exactly are you, Mijo from the prophecy?" said Jomi, as Mijo was completely stunned. "Don't you.. no no.. no.. I.. knew you before this. I am a lightner, been with you since a year ago.." responded Mijo with a hint of worry, as Jomi became concerned. "Huh? This is the first time, lightner. Your first descent into this world." responded Jomi with a hint of worry.

"**This** world, yes. But.. not the dark worlds!" exclaimed Mijo, as Jomi took a closer look at Mijo. "Hmm, I see.. Then, this must mean.." said Jomi, as she got a book from behind her and swiped through it until she found a page she was keeping bookmarked. "There are other versions of me.. other dark worlds.." said Jomi, as she slumped on her chair, looking more exhausted. "H—huh? There can be different versions of Jomi? T—then where's my Jomi?" asked Mijo, as the other Jomi was staring off. "I.. understand.. but.. Jomi..? Where can I start in this world? Maybe I can go and find my Jomi, and help you in the process." said Mijo, as Jomi finally paid attention to him and responded, "Go. You're dismissed. Just follow the forest nearby. Come back tomorrow if you want, because it's almost night." as Jomi continued to stare off into the distance. "Oh, night? Don't worry.. Jomi, I'll be fine. I'll come back if I don't find anything, good.. ni— no, um.. bye." said Mijo before he left the tent.

He greeted the guards goodbye before leaving, "¡¡Adios!!" says Mijo as he goes to the forest, the sky being pitch black with only the singular moon to reflect light. "I wonder what I'll find in the forest..?" asked Mijo to himself as he walked to the forest, sheath in hand for any dangers. He walks around until he hears some fighting happening nearby. "Oh? Time for me to save the day! Hopefully it's not that queen immediately haha.." said Mijo to himself as he ran to the noise. He saw Rhida and a Jomi fight side-by-side against some armed guards with halberds. "Oh..? JOMI!! and, Rhida..?" exclaimed Mijo as he intervened and fought the guards one-by-one. "Mijo? Mijo! Quick, let's finish up here." responded Jomi, as their combined strength finally pushed the guards out, forcing them to retreat.

"Finally! Me and Rhida were fighting them for a while now... Whew.. Mijo, you found any place where we can stay for the night?" asked Jomi, as Rhida is close behind Jomi, not saying anything. "Oh, uh yeah. But you're going to be pretty surprised when we enter the place, come on, follow me, I know where to go this time, haha.." said Mijo, before the other two followed. "So.. what do you get out of this dark world? Now usually I would do it, but I was ambushed before I could find my way.. It seems that they were targeting me though.." said Jomi, as Mijo and Rhida remained silent due to one another. "Mmm? Mijo?" questioned Jomi, as she looked at both of them. "Oh right.. Well, either way.. Mijo, you gotta tell us what's been happening here.."

"Mmm.. Well, go see for yourself." said Mijo, as they are back in the base with a bunch of the people there now looking at Jomi and Rhida weirdly. "Huh? Do these people know me or something?"

"Well.. not exactly.. come with me." Mijo directs the two to a tent. "Hmm.. Rhida, do you want to go inside too?" asked Mijo, as Rhida stopped and shook her head. "Huh? Why?" asked Jomi, as she was confused why Rhida didn't want to go inside. "Don't worry, Jomi. I.. think it's reasonable." said Mijo, as he dragged a confused Jomi inside.

Jomi saw Jomi, and they were both shocked. "Ok, so we're both clear, you're Jomi 1," Mijo points at the Jomi he just dragged inside. "and you're Jomi 2. Got it?" Mijo points to the Jomi sitting on a chair. "W—who are you?!" said both Jomi's at the same time. "T—this.. is.. impossible! If there are versions of me, then.. then.." Jomi 1 said, trailing off. "Mijo.. ¡¿¿Por qué la trajiste aquí??!" asked Jomi 2, as she stood up.

"Ah.. well.. I just.. you know.. If I.. put the two of you together here, you'll merge? Look, I.. just.. don't know what to do with two Jomis.." said Mijo, as he scratched his head. "Um, other Jomi, ¿Has leído sobre algún acontecimiento como éste?" asked Jomi 1, with concern all over her face.

"Sí, literalmente ahora mismo. O vivimos los dos una doble vida o... uno de los dos tiene que.. _morir._" said Jomi 2, as she was avoiding looking at Jomi 1 or Mijo. "¡¿Morir?! Wait.. Uh, I mean, you guys can coexist right? No one has to die— um.. yeah." commented Mijo, as the eerie silence took over the tent.

"Hmm.. No sé.. Porque.. This hasn't happened before— anything after this, it's unknown territory." explained Jomi 2, as she slumped over her chair, a bit weary. "It's weird.. if.. we're.. you know, versions of Mijo, then how can there be two versions of an already equivalent..?" asked Jomi 1, as she sat on the floor nearby.

"Ah.. well, have I told you about the second notebook I have?" said Mijo, with a bit of a smirk. "¡¡¿Que?!!" said the two Jomi's. "H—hold on.. So.. if you have the pink notebook.. what's the other one? Purple?" asked Jomi 1. "Blue.. But it has.. a.. cover. Like; 'Everything starts with an idea, be creative!' "

The two Jomi's look at each other, unamused. Jomi 1 turns to Mijo. "Really.." Jomi stares down Mijo as Jomi 2 spoke up again. "Well, what's done is done. Either way, we need to continue this, without one of us dying." 

"Yeah, estoy de acuerdo." Jomi 1 turns to Jomi 2. "I have an idea, double life. We both attend both of our duties, same name, but to people that know.. uh.. I am.. Jomba, and your Jombi."

"Good idea. But, what if someone overhears?" Jombi asks, with a thoughtful look. "Then we acknowledge it, it's just a simple mod, and it's not like there's going to be a difference.. well, noticeable difference." answered Jomba, as she stood up.

"But.. how can we tell you two apart? Like it's if you took Jomi and cloned her! So for example, if I met Jomi in the rebel camp, how do I know if it's actually Jombi or Jomba?" asked Rhida, as Mijo nodded in agreement. Mijo looked at Rhida again, as she just recently entered without him noticing. "Hey, Jomba.. I have an idea, but.. it's important that only **you** hear this." said Jombi, as she whispered something incomprehensible to the other two.

"Ah.. si.. ¿Es eso posible? Hmm.. Lo pensaré... Pero tendré una respuesta.. **mañana.**" said Jomba, as she heard Jombi's whisper. "Hmm.. Ah. Well, I guess it's up to you two Jomis' to take care of whatever happened.. Can we rest now or something?" asked Mijo, as Jombi pulled back from Jomba's ear. "Yeah. Uh.. Jomba, do you have any extra or free tents we can use?" asks Jombi as Jomba nodded and whispered to her. 

"Oh. Ok, got it." said Jombi before she pulled back. "Alright, see you. Jomi." said Jombi to Jomba as she directed the lightners out of the tent. "Hey.. why do you two keep whispering to each other..? Hmph. I thought we were done with secrets, hmm?" teased Mijo, as Rhida nodded in agreement. "It's something important. It's between Jomis'.. it'll make sense soon, just wait."  answered Jomi, as they arrived at a free tent and nearby an abandoned building.

"Hmm.. wait how are we getting out of here?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nodded in agreement. "Oh right. Hmm.. Hey, let's go to that building right there." said Jomi before she walked to the abandoned building as the other two followed. Once they arrived they saw more clearly what the abandoned building looked like it used to be a classroom, but it has now been devastated by war. "Oh wow. It's another classroom, go figures." commented Mijo, before Jomi stopped at the middle of the building.

## Summary:

Something has been taken inside Mijo, and yet he doesn't know what or why, he feels a lot of mixed emotions of guilt, anger, sadness but most of the time faint numbness.

CAT - Citizen's Army Training

## Author's Note:

Combining some scenes that are too episodic to combine properly, also a test of my strength. This is in line with this release.

Also, as you can see, I've been going through it, as seen with my current writing, so apologies, if you want C3S1 or C5S2 to be done, It's getting there, but it's true release is in the indefinite future.

Edit 1: By the way, this spinoff is assuming that you read C5S2, before and during it. Yeah, it's that expansive. 
Anyways, it's a culmination of drafts for C5S2 as well as some scenes from not-finished spinoffs. 
I do know that some of the chapters I have mentioned aren't done yet, but once it's done, you'll see why. — jmb~ | Oct 4, 12:26

Edit 2: C6S2 baby. Anyways, above makes more sense again. — jmb~ | Oct 5, 16:26

_Friday, outside the classroom, near the hallway balcony_

Mijo is listening to somber melancholic music, as he looks out to the intense rain happening right in front of him.

"I am a failure..." Mijo says, as he looks out, alone with his thoughts. "I can't keep up. I can't. The pressure.. it.. broke me." Mijo continues, as he continues to be alone in his own thoughts.

"I am no longer fit to be any position of power." Mijo says again, repeating his own thoughts. "I should.. listen, and stay dead. The willpower? Gone. That fire? Gone." Mijo continued, tears almost flowing out before he stopped himself.

"No one's here to comfort me. Rhida's busy with research, Kai (Ikari) and Lauv (Lauvielle), they've both gone home. Urda's on some, random stuff.. But, she's still busy. I know that perfectly well." Mijo looks to his right, seeing Urda with some of her other friends. Mijo looks back to the rain, he felt the rain getting more intense, he's not sure if it's his imagination anymore.

"It's lucky.. that we even got a half day today. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do." Mijo looked to his left, he sees JR walking out. But then, Lauvielle appeared and he looked away. "That's probably for research, forget about it. I don't think they need more of.. this." said Mijo, before he picked up his bag and left his spot. 

He went down the stairs, noticing the flooding on his feet. Then he walked slowly through the corridors of the school, passing by people worried for their research. Afterwards, he walked past his old classrooms. "Oh.. these.."  murmured Mijo to himself, as he continued walking. Soon after, he arrived at a waiting area. He noticed Ikari there.

"Kai..?" said Mijo, as he went closer to her. "Yeah, it's me! You're stuck here too? Are you commuting? The rain's really heavy right now..!" said Ikari, as he put down his bags nearby. "Yeah, I am commuting.. I just have to wait for this to end." said Mijo as he watched the rain fall. Ikari noticed his unusual attitude, he was nonchalant, but he's... too calm. But, she didn't push it, she had her own problems anyway.

"Yeah, I am waiting for my dad, which by the way, was supposed to be arriving.. thirty minutes ago!" ranted Ikari, as she also watched the rain. "Oh, that's.. funny.. haha." remarked Mijo, his laugh being a bit more fake than she expected. "Hmph. You're lucky. My dad's arriving after that online quiz is done, plus my bilao painting." joked Ikari, as she waited impatiently for her dad.

"Oh, cool." said Mijo, a bit nonchalant. "Mijo! The water.. it's.. overflowing the drainage, quick! Let's go!" said Ikari, noticing the flooding and another nearby elevated waiting area. Mijo nods and they head there, making their shoes wet but the clothes not so much. They arrive at the other waiting area, catching their breath. "Whew.. it's a good thing this piece of shit plastic envelope didn't fail and my laptop died from one drop of rainwater." commented Ikari, as she washed off the droplets of rain on her envelope.

"Haha.. yeah.." responded Mijo, trying to keep up with the conversation. "Anyways.. This mfer.. is going to take as long as if I walked home, twice!" continued Ikari, as she frantically looked at her phone. "True.." Mijo stops himself, he was going to joke about how he could've also walked home, but he didn't know what Ikari would think. "Well.. I don't fucking know what to do now.." Ikari crossed her arms and was looking at the vehicles on the road as the rain continued to pour.

Mijo looks at their surroundings, he doesn't want to disturb Ikari about his problems, since he knows of her family and school problems, he doesn't want to add on to that. "It's 2:30.." remarked Mijo, before Ikari screamed in frustration. "There he is! Fucking god.." said Ikari, as she points to a tricycle that looked like Ikari's dad. "Well.. see you, Mijo. Bye~~~" said Ikari, as she rushed to the tricycle, leaving Mijo in the waiting area. "I should go. The rain is weakening." said Mijo as he walked in the rain, eventually commuting and going home, not before noticing the argument between Ikari and her father.

_Next week, Monday, at the Dark World_

"Hey..! Mijo." said Jomi, as she greets him with a hand wave. "Mhm." Mijo dismissed her and continued walking. "Huh? Mijo.." Jomi walks up to him but he pushes her back. "No. Stay away." Mijo says to Jomi firmly as he continues on his way, his destination unclear. "Mijo..? I.. can't let you be alone, y'know. I gotta at least know." said Jomi, before Mijo glared at her with his lightning magic flaring. He stares at her, his lightning magic all around him before he looks away, turning his back and says, "I'm going to Nuevo León." said Mijo before walking to the portal that took them there.

"Wait! Why..!" shouted Jomi as she ran to Mijo, he already entered the portal so she stopped on the edge of the portal doorway. "What is he doing.." muttered Jomi to herself, as Rhida arrived at the dark world and saw Jomi. "Hey, Jomi? Were you about to go to Nuevo León?" asked Rhida, as Jomi stepped back, a bit surprised but nodded. "Oh, ok. Did you see Mi-mi around here?" asked Jomi, referring to Mijo. "Yeah, he went in. Let's find him, I don't think he's in a good headspace." said Jomi, as they went inside and saw the familiar walls.

"Ok, so.. where could he have gone.. hold on, let me detect his energy." said Jomi, as she does some magical spell. "Wait? You can do that?" asked Rhida, as Jomi awkwardly smiled as she finished the spell. "Uh.. yeah.. I had to.. ahem. Don't worry, I'll teach it later. It involves.. a lot more intimacy that you probably don't want to hear about, don't worry, just follow me, and you'll find your boyfriend, ok?" said Jomi, with a smile as Rhida chuckled and responded, "Alright. You know me. Let's go." Rhida and Jomi walked, Jomi following something invisible to everybody else.

Eventually they arrive at a random part of a huge forest, as they hear fighting. "Hm, I think that's him. Keep your weapons ready, just in case." Jomi summons her ōdachi, while Rhida summons her ice sword. "Ready, Jomi." said Rhida, before they approached the noise. As soon as they arrive, they see Mijo letting loose on some grunts and monsters around the forest, decimating them one-by-one. He's wearing headphones that seem to not go off of him as he slashes and dices the monsters with anger that he seemed to be letting out.

He noticed them, but he doesn't care, he continues his onslaught against the grunts and monsters, as the two looked on, very concerned. "Jomi.. you know how to deal with this..?" whispered Rhida to Jomi. "I.. uh.. I guess you haven't seen much of his darker side, no?" whispered back Jomi. "What.. um.. explain." responded Rhida, before Mijo finished and looked at the two. "You found me, huh? Well, whatever. Let me make it clear," said Mijo, before he pointed his ōdachi and sheath at the two. "don't come for me. Else you'll get my wrath."

The two freeze on the spot, Rhida is frozen, she'd truly never seen him like this before, and she'd not even talked to him for a month or two, so she doesn't know what to make of her boyfriend's new attitude. "Mijo..? I understand needing to be alone, but.. you know this is just inflicting endless pain on others, even if we're their enemies." said Jomi, as Mijo stumbled back a bit before raising his sword again. He falters a bit in his words, "I.. stop. SHUT UP!" Mijo teleports to Jomi, their swords clashing.

Rhida takes a step back, now shaking, as she doesn't know what to do with the two people she considers to be close friends, fighting. "Please, Mijo. You know we can.. alleviate this at least. Please, put the sword down. Let us talk. Rhida's here right? She's your love, and I am your other side, I don't know if we can fix your problems, but.. lashing out like this, isn't the solution." said Jomi, as Mijo's magic falters a bit, the words getting to him. 

"I.. can't take it anymore! Jomi! You know how much I feel every fucking day! I am stuck, in a seat for 7 hours, far away from my friends, my loved ones, you! Just so school can give me a grade I feel hollow for. I feel alone, no matter how much you say, I can't say I am happy for most of the times I live on this fuckin world. Even here, I can't feel anything when I am not angry or crying at the edge of a cliff. So! If you're the true therapist and mature one between the two of us, tell me. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG. WITH ME?!!" responded Mijo to Jomi, as Rhida teared up, seeing herself in him as well as empathy for her lover.

Jomi went silent. Mijo quickly pulled back before summoning slashes against Jomi, forcing her to parry. "I.. want to help you, Mijo.." said Jomi as she kept deflecting and dodging Mijo's continuous attacks. "But.. you're forcing my hand.." said Jomi, as she began to attack as well. "Stop! Please! Mijo, calm down!! Jomi, please find a way to calm him down!" shouted Rhida, as both of the two stopped. "I.. know." said Jomi, as she saw Mijo's lightning flicker a bit. Mijo looked at Rhida, then Jomi, before stabbing himself in the heart. "MIJO!!!" shouted the other two, as the two ran to his body. "I.. don't think he can die. But, he's.. escaping us. I'll try to heal it, but.. I don't think I am welcome in Mijo's mind." said Jomi, as she healed him after pulling the sword out.

"I.. I can try." said Rhida as she looked at Mijo, concerned. "Hmm.. Good point. I'll transport you in there right now, do note that your body here will go limp due to the transfer of consciousness." explained Jomi, as Rhida looked at hands and chest before nodding. "Ok, I acknowledge." said Rhida, before Jomi did a magical spell and Rhida fainted.

"Whew.. I.. guess that's weird.. I wonder if that's how Jomi does it.." said Rhida, before she saw Mijo, in his school clothing. They're at a hallway of their school, near their current classrooms. "Oh, well.. that makes sense." Rhida walks up to Mijo. "Hey.. Mijo?" Mijo turned around, very imposing on Rhida. Mijo's eyes were narrowed before going back to normal. "Oh, Rhida. What are you doing here?" asked Mijo, as he looked behind her. "Um, uh.. I.. just wanted to speak to you. Like before, haha."

"Hm? I thought you didn't go to school today. From what I've heard at least." said Mijo, as Rhida eyes widened. "Oh, really..? Um, well.. I  am here, now." said Rhida, as she realized that in Mijo's dream, she's already gone. "I see." said Mijo as he stared off absent-mindedly behind him. "This is a dream, isn't it?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Yeah. Uh, did you know..?"

 "Well, I was doubtful if this was real. But now you're here, It's a dream." said Mijo, as he looked back at Rhida. Rhida teared up a bit, she didn't know why. "Ah.. um.. I.. I see." said Rhida, looking at a stern Mijo. "You're.. different. I don't think I ever talked to you in my dreams. You even approached me." remarked Mijo, as he looked away. "Because.." Rhida says in-between sobs. "I am Rhida.. The real one, I was brought here by Jomi. She's.. healing you right now."

Mijo doesn't even react, but he stops for a while, before turning to look at Rhida. "Hm. I guess that's expected. But, I didn't know _you_ would be here." said Mijo, as his face remained neutral. "Ah.. well, this is all so new to me anyway. I.. I.." said Rhida before she hugged him. Mijo was initially surprised, but returned the hug, patting her back. "Hey.. hey, what's the problem? I.." asked Mijo before stopping himself. "It's just.. I can't bear seeing you like this, Mijo.. Why didn't you tell me..? We promised to talk to each other without hiding anything, remember?"

Mijo remained silent, as his body stiffened. "Please.. Mijo, you can let it out. We're in a dream.. and, I promise, I won't tell anyone. Not even Jomi— if you don't want to." said Rhida, as Mijo tightened the hug. "Tell her. She deserves to know." responded Mijo, as they both pulled back. 

"Okay. Just so you know, I've.. always felt alone. I don't want to admit it, because.. it's selfish, no? I've been surrounded with people willing to help me, and yet I feel alone? What's this, just talk with them, it's not that hard.." explained Mijo, as Rhida listened intently, calming down. "Yet, I do still feel it... I admit, even with my achievements, and successes, I doubt myself. I can't figure out if I should be confident because I can't find the balance between self-criticism and self-assurance." continued Mijo, as he walked to the balcony in their second floor hallway.

"This.. pressure to stay and maintain scores, quizzes, performance tasks, and my facade of staying obedient to these.. these.. officers. I don't get it anymore, I am losing the battle, and it feels so hard to keep fighting. The teachers' don't help, I understand their comments on the class, but I.. feel like they **try** to understand us, but each individual has different problems, issues that some might help, but others make it worse." continues Mijo, as Rhida moved to his left and looked at him thoughtfully.

"I.. just feel so hopeless. I want to escape, but every time.. It makes things worse, so.. it repeats. I feel worse, so I escape, but that makes things worse, so repeat." Mijo looks at Rhida, disappointed. "The worst part is.. it's inherent in my behavior. I don't think I or Jomi have told you this before, but.. we both came to consensus that both of us have some form of either ADHD or Autism." said Mijo, as Rhida widened her eyes. "Since, you know.. we are **kinda** related—" said Mijo, with a smile and a wink. "—we both have this.. form. So, while she can manage it, due to her prowess and.. well, just being more powerful with her life, she manages it quite well. I asked her about it, some time ago."

Rhida nods, as Mijo continued. "I.. know, this is a monologue, but you came into my dream so.. haha.. Anyways, because of our differences in our situation about our own support systems and control of our lives, I have.. a more rash personality. Even though, yes.. I am better at fighting, she's generally good at magic. Basically my ideal self. I guess.. I have to admit, while I look very masculine, I have an interest in other forms, like Jomi's. Another form of escapism, I guess." Mijo takes a huge breath as he turns to Rhida, his head closer to her head. "I think Jomi's done." Mijo kissed Rhida, as she was initially surprised but quickly returned the long kiss, as Mijo woke up.

The two are in the same bed, with the two cuddling each other, as Jomi watches them, with a grin. As soon as the two returned to their life, the two felt each other and quickly pulled back. "Ah! M—Mijo..?" said Rhida, as Mijo responded, "Rhida..!" as they look at each other, both flustered. "Oh, you two are awake.. I was beginning to think that Mijo was doing more intimate stuff with you." said Jomi, talking to Rhida, the closer one to her.

"H—Hey! I swear.. there'll be a day I'll get back at you.." said Rhida, a bit flustered but smiling. "Wingwoman Jomi, as always." added Mijo, as the other two chuckled a bit. "Alright. Well, let's go. Unless you want me to leave?" asked Jomi, with a grin. "HEY! Jomi, come on girl.." Rhida is blushing more as she gets out of bed. "Well, I feel much better. Let's go, before we run out of free time." said Mijo, smiling for the first time in a while as he got out of bed. "Awww.. Mijo..! Anyways, yeah I agree. Let's go out, I got some errands we can do together, haha!" said Jomi as they both left the tent.

_Next day, Wednesday, at the classroom, it's during their free time_

Mijo looks around his classroom, seeing his friends chatting to each other. He looked at the right, seeing Ikari and Lauvielle, talking with his other classmates. Then to his left, Dani and Candi, his research group mates with some other people.

"Again.. alone." mumbled Mijo to himself, while listening to music that echoed his thoughts of a cycle he never seemed to break out of, a depressive one at that. "Self-imposed one at that. I _wish_ I can just.. talk about me, and myself.. But, then.. I would sound narcissistic." continued Mijo, while looking at Ikari and Lauvielle. 

"If I could.. retrace every wrong move, I would.. If I could  take the blame I would. But just washing it aside, pretending I don't feel misplaced, it's so much easier than change..!" mumbled Mijo, repeating the lyrics of the music he's listening to. 

He stops listening and puts his earphones into his bag, as tears flow from his face. He quickly hides it and wipes it away with his handkerchief. Then he looks at the outside of his classroom, he sees the day, but he can't help but feel weird when looking at specific people. Specifically the CAT officers and Justina.

"I.. don't know how to feel about these officers, they're what caused my.. headspace right now, but they're also acquaintances, one of them even friends." said Mijo to himself, as he looked at Cani and Dani, before looking away.

"I just.. I remember yesterday.. It's hard to keep yourself steady when you know you have to focus on their words, your thoughts and feelings. After that, I have no room for my own words, I don't need to speak, so I don't." said Mijo as he looked at his hands, trembling. "Justina. She's.. trans. I.. just. I wish I could introduce her to the dark world.. But, we're not friends. I don't trust anyone else. I also hold authority to decide who to trust with it, since me and Urda discovered it first." continued Mijo, as he turned to look at Justina on the brink of breaking mentally.

_Fast forward to after school, Mijo's walking around the school_

"I feel guilty. But I shouldn't be. I feel alone. I shouldn't. I feel sad, I shouldn't. I.. should love myself, and trust myself, but.. I don't." said Mijo, looking away, staring off into the distance. "Every time.." Mijo turned to look at the CAT officers marching with sabres and replica guns. He quickly looked away, feeling a sense of dread whenever he saw them or the uniform they wore. "They told me, I should salute them every time I meet them.. I don't remember the rest, I don't trust myself that much that any place I remember, like the hallways and the canteen are strictly forbidden." continued Mijo, as he looked at the new building that was slowly being cleaned up after the reconstruction.

"I wonder, what's going to happen there? It's weird, it's.. blue and white. Compared to the usual green and peach color of the other older buildings. It makes sense, since it was built with sponsorship from that security bank, but why do they have their own special color instead of following the Honrato one..?" commented Mijo, momentarily distracting himself before returning to face the CAT officers. "I.. don't have the courage nor the self-confidence to face the might of the organization and club adviser on the reasons I shouldn't be in, or for that matter why it shouldn't be mandatory or even just letting me live!" said Mijo to himself, as he went silent and stared at them with angst. 

"I am not even an officer. Just a cadet, like a conscript into the military." said Mijo, before he saw his parents were nearby to pick him up. "I think they'll get it, but.. when we both get home, there's a sense of exhaustion.. They're also busy with their own stuff. I am afraid, and it's very unfortunate that.. I will only speak to them if my situation's very bad." said Mijo, as he picked up his bag and went to his parents.

_Next day, Thursday, Mijo is in the dark world, on his usual training, fighting some monster holograms_

Mijo is fighting some holograms, as he usually does. He's training his fighting skills, as he uses a variety of weapons. Although, when Ikari arrived, a conversation started.

"Hey. Mijo." greeted Ikari, with a more serious tone than usual. "Oh, yeah?" asked Mijo as he turned off the holograms and they went to nearby chairs to talk. 

"Can I get very real, just like this once, dude?" asked Ikari, as Mijo nodded. "I don't like Lauvielle anymore, and I don't think she particularly does either." said Ikari, as Mijo grimaced at these words. "I don't like how they always leave me out of stuff. Remember when she went into the dark world with a lot of people? I wasn't invited and when I arrived, they were already around the city." continued Ikari, as Mijo expressed disappointment. "I see. I think that was yesterday, right?" asked Mijo, as Ikari nodded. Mijo stood up and said, "Well.. I guess it's up to you. This is between you and Lauvielle." Ikari also stood up, with a grin and said, "Yeah. Anyways, I'll be at that gaming section in the city if you need me, bye!" said Ikari, as she waved goodbye, more relieved.

"I realize.. that it's a cycle." Mijo sits down again, putting his sword down nearby. " A cycle of—" Mijo is cut off by Jomi, running to the training area. "Whew.. Was I late, Mijo?" asked Jomi, looking very rushed. "Why... oh right. I did say to you yesterday you should be here.. Actually, the time I provided was probably too early. You came here at the right time."

"Good. For a second, I thought you would chastise me for my lateness, haha!" said Jomi as she sat down. "Nah. That would be _very_ hypocritical of me." said Mijo, as Jomi chuckled. "I forget.. haha.. anyways, so what did you want to talk about? Um, continue." asked Jomi, as Mijo took a deep breath and sighed.

"Again, it's a cycle. A cycle of a little bit of happiness and the deepest darkest abyssal depression you've experienced. I.. know, it's kinda weird to talk to someone who actually experienced abuse. Because.. it's.. bad right? It feels like comparing this is also bad, but.. I can't help it. Jomi, be honest. What do you think about the 'trauma' we both went through?" asked Mijo, as Jomi was concerned but understanding.

"The trauma..? I.. don't consider yours.. necessarily easier to go through than mine. I don't think we can compare traumas, you're right. What really matters is how it affects us, because.. while we can argue what is worse, which by your implication, you think mine.. This sense of trauma and stress affects us all the same." explained Jomi, as she looked away in deep thought.

"I.. guess. I just needed to hear it from a different perspective. Still, how do you actually go through life with that past burden? Do you experience anything that you'd consider to be a trauma response, or have you healed from it..?" asked Mijo, as Jomi kept her eyes off of him, deep in thought.

"Healing..? Well, how about you first? I.. don't know if I can say anything, since I am so busy with my governmental work that I live without self reflection most of the time. I don't consider this, because.. I am.. content..? Get it? Often, hard times make me self-reflect but.. for these past few months, it's been the usual paperwork and inspections.. I don't remember much if I experienced it before this era, all I know is I don't know." responded Jomi, as she teared up a bit for unknown reasons to her.

"I.. see. I always thought that you have more.. mature problems, like I have school while you run an entire kingdom so the problems are way different, but yeah, I can see that happening if I wasn't alone most of the day, willingly. I.. just wished that I could change something.. by myself. Like here, I am powerful enough to change the course of the dark world but.. then again, it's almost always better collectively. So, instead I am paralyzed in my decisions." said Mijo, as Jomi looked back at him, very concerned.

"I.. see. Powerless? Yeah, I've been there, as you know. It.. can be damaging to your motivation, and even willpower and the only saving grace.. is everybody around you. I would assume that you truly don't have anyone to lean to, to fight your inner demons. Except, I can also assume that.. well, you have people, it's just you don't know if you can share them right? I saw this with Rhida, you were willing to keep it to yourself until it started hurting more than just you. You're self-sacrificial, right? You would rather bear the burden so others don't, seeing as how I am on a high position and you're the hero of this world.. This is your ideal, correct?" analyzed Jomi, as Mijo sadly nodded.

"Yeah. You're correct. Of course, you know me the most. Both willingly and unwillingly. It's easier to run to you, or fight random enemies instead of facing insurmountable enemies that force is simply useless against. I can physically harm myself, so what? I die, I surrender, if I don't then I am more wounded than before. It's.. like I am sick of being stuck. Rigid and still, but.. I want to move like the wind or as fast as lightning." said Mijo, as he looked at his weapon.

"So, what..? There's still.. a lot to do, to be honest. But, I am here for you. Until I can't physically go to you, I'll always be here. Other matters can wait, if it wasn't for you and her, I wouldn't be here. Anyways, looks like our time ran out. Wanna help in some matters concerning a couple of abyss monsters? It's easy, haha." said Jomi, as she looked at him with a bit of a smile.

"Of course. I would rather spend these days happy, than melancholic. Let's go, Her Majesty's Royal—" said Mijo before Jomi nudged him. "Hey! No need to say my full title.. I don't even use it, come on... Do I call you Mijo—" said Jomi before Mijo cuts her off. "I get it. I was just mocking it, seriously.. Why do you royals always have long names? It's not like having short ones will significantly affect your status.. If that's the case, I am sorry but your kingdom sucked." continued Mijo, as Jomi chuckled. "Well.. I haven't been an actual royal for a long time, so I'll get back to you on that, haha~~" added Jomi, before they headed out of the training area.

_Next day, Friday, Teacher's Day, near the classroom_

Mijo is staring absent-mindedly at the current celebration of the day, and as he does so, he is reminded that he's a part of the class and the student population.

"Hey dude!" greeted Urda as she is with Reeb. "Oh! Hi!" responded Mijo to Urda before they did a personal handshake. "Oh, you guys are close huh? Well, Urda.. You want me to leave?" asked Reeb as Urda answered, "Do whatever you want man.. You can listen or whatever." Reeb nodded and waves to Mijo, as Mijo waved back.

"Aight." said Mijo as Urda went closer, Reeb maintained her distance. "Anyways dude, any thing? I mean, it's been a while since we last talked IRL.. or even online to be honest.." said Urda, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I agree. I was just busy with my stuff.. You never got.. well, we can't be together bro, the segregation of special sections is reeeal.." responded Mijo, as Urda smiled. 

"Haha, yeah. I am still thankful for no spanish subject, but it's a shame that we can't talk much anymore. You always seem to be in another world whenever I see you, either having earphones on or staring off into the distance." observed Urda, as Mijo quickly looked away, a bit embarrassed. "True, true.. I assumed no one would talk with me, so I did that. Our schedules' in the dark world are even different now! You're the earlier one, so really after that other schedule change we haven't done sparring in a while." responded Mijo, as he looked back, a small smile forming on his lips.

"Yeah, we should probably start making time.. Oh, I still have to work on that manuscript with Ikari tomorrow.. Anyways, later, let's play that newest update in Wavey Waves 1.3, it's a new area too, so more exploration stuff.." said Urda, as Mijo nodded, forming a full smile. "Goods! You got anything else important?" asked Mijo, as Urda shook her head. "Nah bro. Oh, yeah.. The dark world later, ok? Byee!" said Urda as she went to Reeb.

"Hmm.. that reminds me, I should check up on... _her._" muttered Mijo to himself, as he put his phone into his sling bag and walked to the next-door classroom. "Hmm.. oh JR. Perfect." murmured Mijo as he sees JR. "Hey, JR.. You know where.. uhh.. _she_ is?" asked Mijo, as JR was a bit confused, then quickly figured the person out. "Oh, Rhida? She's not inside. I think she's busy with some work on the event later.. Though, a suggestion.. you should probably wait until later, like until the dark world opens. She probably told you, but she **is** really busy this time." answered JR, as Mijo nodded. 

"I see. JR, any updates? On yourself, I mean." asked Mijo, as JR looked at his phone before he directed him to the balcony wall. "Well, it's nothing much. I am also busy by the way, but I took a break for myself this time for lunch. It's parol making, and I have to do it until next week wed." JR takes a big sigh. "I just wanna graduate man.. I mean, just living the life like this? Well.. I at least have to enjoy it, unlike before. Days pass anyway." 

"Oh, I see. Oh yeah, we went to UECL. Met Sir Kulay. Got the research reviewed and consulted. That's.. it, pretty much." said Mijo, as JR nodded. "Hm. ok. Oh, I am leaving now, still buying food so.. bye, Mijo!" said JR before he left.

"Alright. That's settled. Hmm.. Oh, the others. Time to head back." said Mijo, as he went back to his classroom.

_Fast forward to the Dark World, Mijo just jumped in_

Mijo saw the amount of fighting in front of him. Jomi's Elite Guards are attacking the abyss monsters as Urda shows up behind him. "Oh, damn. Monsters. Easy, these guards have a fighting chance. That means we can safely assume they're weak." said Urda as she summoned her swords. "Finally, some **real** _fucking_ action."

"Mhm. _Agreed._" said Mijo, as he summoned his sword. "Split up. These monsters might be weak, but they're hordes. Let's go." added Mijo, as they both nodded. They went different ways, Mijo to the left, and Urda to the right. 

Mijo easily slashed through the monsters, methodical and strategic. He hadn't been expecting to fight, but he still wasn't rusty so he fought them easily. As he went through the enemies, he saw a familiar enemy in his periphery.

"Surprise~ " said Cara, an old enemy he didn't know would appear, he was quickly knocked back. "Agh! It's.. you.. Cara? How.." asked Mijo, as Cara possessed Jomi and held her sword. "Wait.. you.. how?" questioned Mijo, as he stood up, sword pointed at her. "Hello, again. Miss me? Well, here I am, with the doctor's advice~ " explained Cara, as she held up Jomi's sword. "This? Well, we share this body, why not use it again? I mean, I only repossessed her, ehe~ "

"You..? Fudge.. FUCK YOU!" said Mijo, before he teleported and started attacking her. "Mmm~" Cara surprised Mijo, and he managed to dodge but he stopped attacking. "Damn it.. There's no way I can defeat you yet. My energy is spent. Jomi is obviously compromised.. Well, The Dark Pearl." said Mijo as he ran away. "Hm? Mijo, let's have a fair one on one." said Cara as she teleported to Mijo. They clashed blades, but Mijo managed to quickly deflect and teleport away. 

"Where the fuck am I going.. where.. where is.. this.." Mijo gasps as he sees Rhida fighting some abyss monsters. "Bad timing.. or good? Whatever." Mijo ran to Rhida, and he stopped just beside her to look around. "Good. _She_ isn't here." commented Mijo, as he turned to focus on Rhida. "Who? Jomi..? Is it a good thing that the lead commander is missing?" asked Rhida as Mijo stopped for a moment then answered, "Well.. to be exact, remember the first cataclysm? Where Jomi was corrupted by this abyss being? Well, apparently she decided to try a 3rd time. After.. she tried on me, during the student's night." explained Mijo, as Rhida immediately became concerned. 

"Oh, I thought this was the typical weekly infestation.. They always seem to arrive at these important events. Maybe we should—" remarked Rhida, before a certain blade slashed Rhida's right side, knocking her back to Mijo's body. Then the intruder was clearly visible to both of them, Cara.

"Surprise!" shouted Cara as she suddenly summoned a purple firestorm that was blocked by a huge ice wall created by Rhida, still injured. Mijo quickly sustained the defense by infusing the ice wall with electricity, in the process dealing freeze damage to the three, but that is enough to stop Cara's attacks, and destroy the ice wall.

"Haha.. That's.. good. Elemental infusions? I thought you forgot about it.. but, fair enough.. It has only been a couple of months since our last meeting." said Cara, as she struggled to stand up. "It's.. uh.. yeah. So, what are you doing? What do you **really** want from us?" Mijo says as he stands up and unconsciously puts Rhida behind him.

"Testing the waters. Anyway, I am satisfied. That was a good fight. Anyways, enjoy your life or whatever you do outside here. Oh wait, lemme dig into Jomi's memories.." answered Cara as she sheathed Jomi's sword. "Oh, oh! Damn. You go through all 'at? Well, well.. I guess I'll keep this in mind. Anyways, I am leaving, see you~" said Cara waving goodbye, as Jomi faints.

"Jomi!" said Mijo as he ran to Jomi's body. "H—huh..? What happened.. how did.. shit.. Cara.. no, no.. What happened??! Mijo.." panicked Jomi, as she was helped up by Mijo. "I.. it's Cara. She's watching us with the _abyss doctor._ They're still planning something, even after the second cataclysm... Jomi, are you good though? I.. recognize your predicament." asked Mijo, as Jomi looked around her and nodded. "Yeah it's fine. Nothing I couldn't take before. She likely read my memories.. But, it doesn't matter. I also read hers. That.. needs to be compiled first.. and I am soo tired.. She used all my abyss magic.." answered Jomi as she stumbles a bit. 

"Oh, uh.. Rhida.. is **she** good?" asked Jomi, as Mijo looked at Rhida, then dragged Jomi with him to her. "Mijo.. Jomi.. Help.." trembled Rhida, as she tried to heal her own wounds. "Wait. This isn't usual magic damage. Rhida, let me deal with it.. I know how my damage works, and how to heal it." said Jomi, as she healed Rhida, a mix of green and purple energy swirling around her hand and Rhida's wounds. "Ah.. t—thanks.. this type is unknown to me.. can you teach me this?" asked Rhida as Jomi looked at her, a bit worried. "This.. requires intense use of abyss magic, which still is a very dangerous prospect for you lightners, while I still hold a lot of abyssal power." explained Jomi, as she finished and Mijo helped Rhida up.

"Wow.. this is a lot to take in to be honest. Honestly, I was just going to go on a date with my baby over here—" Rhida winks at Mijo. "But all of this, giirll.. Nakakapagod.." said Rhida as she leaned at Mijo's body, very tired. "Rhida!" said Mijo as they both fell over. "Yeah.. your Mijo here just fought a Cara so you're both tired. Anyways, we should head back to my castle, my guards are there so any stragglers should be gone." said Jomi, as the two remained on the floor. "You.. hey! I know what this is, you two are making me carry you! Hays.. whatever." continued Jomi, as she carried Rhida and Mijo, then teleported to her castle.

Jomi meets the others; JR, Urda, Lauvielle, and Ikari at the castle, chatting. Lauvielle and Urda are talking while JR and Ikari are reluctantly talking to each other.

"Hey.." greeted Jomi to the others, exhausted as she carried the two. "Oh! Jomi! What happened..?" asked Lauvielle, as Urda added, "Why are the two unconscious?"

"Um.. in short, someone attacked them. The details should be explained by them, but for now I am just going to bring them inside the castle, ok?" said Jomi, as she struggled to carry the two into the castle.

_An hour later..._

"Ugh.. What.." Mijo flutters awake as he starts to move around the bed, but he suddenly feels someone beside him. "Heh?" Mijo turned around and saw Rhida still sleeping next to him. He quickly pulled back a bit, and blushed. "O—oh.. Must've been Jomi's doing. Well.. how long did I.." said Mijo, as he grabbed his phone from the nearby table. "Oh.. it's 17:00." said Mijo, as Rhida stirred awake. "Ugh.. Mijo..? Mijo..!" said Rhida as she also pulled back, a bit flustered. "Rhida.. um.. so, it's.. 17:00.. Uh, well you can guess what caused this.. Anyways, I just awoke too." responded Mijo, as Rhida calmed down and looked at Mijo.

"Ok.. ok.. Then I should get going.. You know my sched, Mijo. Let's meet next week, hopefully in better spirits." Rhida looked away. "Or not.. There's still so much to do.. Journalism training tomorrow.. as well as that performance task.." Rhida sighs as she stands up. "Mijo, may you stay safe. Adiós, ¡hasta pronto!" said Rhida to Mijo, as she waved goodbye. "Adiós, amor." said Mijo back, as they both smiled. Rhida leaves as Mijo stands up and also gets his things.

"Things don't last.. I hate it." murmured Mijo to himself as he got his things and went outside of the room, seeing Jomi beside the door, panicking internally. "Oh, Jomi? What do you want?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked up at him. "Just something I should tell you, the abyss is still testing and preparing.. It's just, they gained this **boldness** to keep prodding us. I don't know when they will strike." explained Jomi, as Mijo switches to a concerned look. "Oh. Will you figure it out?" asked Mijo, before Jomi shook her head. "I don't know. Times are heating up again.." answered Jomi, as she looked away, sighing.

"I.. got a lot in my mind right now, Jomi. I hate going back to the light world. I hate losing my powers.. I hate being a nobody. I hate my social life there. Here, I have everything, friends, love, heck even something to be proud of, and working towards. I just.. I regret a lot of things in the past. The cycle is not easy to break, y'know? Easier to run here and face Cara and the _Abyss Doctor,_ than the school system I grew to hate. I'm sorry for dumping this on you, but.. I'll probably would've let it out anyway if I don't now." said Mijo, as he waved goodbye to Jomi.

"Let's say hello, to the imperfect tomorrow, Jomi." said Mijo, before Jomi adds, "Hopefully by then, it'll taste bittersweet." 

They wave goodbye for the last time that week, as another school week ends with a light on the horizon that was brighter last week.

## Author's Note:

Whew. That's over. I unfortunately haven't finished C5S2, to set up this one, but hopefully by next month, all shall be done. Anyway, I just realized that I write about my present so I can't seem to complete something about the past so.. there are exceptions, like if it's short like this one (notably c3s1 isn't done because it's too long).

Hopefully by now, you would've realized the context I am writing in, and at the same time, get something out of these collections of a week's worth of angst. See you, then. Whenever that is, goodbye! Stay alive, dear viewer!

<!--Chapter 7 Intramurals part 2, more buildup and potential plot related, idk what it does for now-->
<p id="C7"><md-block># C7 DeltaRambles: The Catalyst</md-block></p>

## Summary: 

The Intramurals are back again! Mijo and his friends hope that this one is relatively fun and without any cataclysmic event happening, but as fate would have it, these lightners are in for a treat.

## Author's Note:

Oh boy, C7? Isn't that the end of season 1? Hey, isn't this also just C3S2? 

Good question! Firstly, the style of the season is different anyway, and so, it doesn't end at 7, (how ironically, since that was the g8 segment) this one? IDK, maybe 12? But, I should complete the others first, haha. As for the recycling chapters one, trust me, it's something you should keep in the back of your mind, anyways!

Enjoy some sports, and angst~

—jmb~

Mijo is looking at the stage of the school gymnasium, as 'Mr. and Ms. Intramurals' is happening in front of him, he's with Ikari, right beside him, watching.

"Hmm. I guess it's good. It's a shame. Unlike last time, they restricted us to the gymnasium.. But, whatever. I can just, make a new one, maybe after the light intramurals are over." said Mijo to himself, as the contestants show themselves to the judges in front.

"Although, something feels off.. I don't know, like.." said Mijo before gasping as he felt his sword in his hand. "Huh? Wait." Mijo looks down, not seeing anything, but feeling something anyway. "What..? Must be my imagination.." Mijo looks away, as Ikari speaks, "Ugh. I swear, that candidate number 4 will win again, probably champion by this point."

"I swear, someone picked the worst partner for our classmate there, like she's so beautiful and confident, while her partner looks tall, but isn't that appealing, it's like.. he doesn't have that muscle that the judges are looking for." continued Ikari, as Mijo nodded in agreement.
"Agreed." said Mijo, now feeling a bit self-conscious about his own body. 

As they continue to watch, Mijo feels that magic again, and this time, it's getting stronger.  "Ikari, I feel like I should go to the dark world. Is that.. normal? I just told Jomi that I'll close it for two days for the intramurals.. But, I feel something's wrong." said Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and answered, "Well, I don't know. But you should probably check it out. There's nothing happening.. yet anyway." responded Ikari, before she looked at the empty stage, as the candidates were preparing their costumes for the next part.

"Ok, thanks." said Mijo before he went back to his classroom, then to the dark world. "Mijo..?" noticed Jomi, as Mijo greeted her. "Hi, Jomi. Any news I should know?" asked Mijo as Jomi looked around and shaked her head. "No, not yet. What? I know the intramurals are happening again, are you expecting **another** cataclysmic event to happen?" asked Jomi as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, I just.. had this weird feeling. I mean, it's like.. I was using magic in the light world, so I'm wondering if you detected any openings." said Mijo as Jomi shaked her head again. 

"No.. huh, that's odd. Hmm, well whatever's going on, its probably best you should go back. The break isn't over and you kinda interrupted me on some preperations when you jumped in." said Jomi, as she held some boxes of random stuff. "Oh, right.. aren't yours done?" asked Mijo as Jomi shaked her head one more time. "No.. not yet. The decorations and other finishing touches aren't done yet. Don't worry, I'll show the updates made to the 'New Intramurals' line up. Me and Rhida have been working very hard to make it interesting again.. Ooh, maybe you can talk to her? She told me she's not that busy these few days."

"Hmm.. I don't know.. I kinda have my own hangouts to do, and probably she does too. Let's just.. do it later once you're done, ok? Now, I better hope you're right and there isn't a catacylsm about to happen." said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and nodded. "Yeah yeah.." said Jomi as they bid goodbye and Mijo went back to the light world.

_Hours later, at lunch break, the Intramurals wasn't finished yet and was cancelled due to a storm and typhoon named 'Kristine!', emphasis on the '!'._

"Hey Mijo!" exclaimed Ikari as she was content in her current progress in her new game inside her handheld. "Huh? Yeah?" asked Mijo as he was putting away things after eating lunch. "Let's go to the dark world again. Before we head home.." said Ikari as Mijo nodded. "Right. We might not even meet her for a couple of days. Come on then, follow me. It should still be open in my backpack.." said Mijo as he opens it somewhere unsuspecting like a secluded area of the classroom then they jump in.

Around them, there is a lot of movement, notably from Jomi's Guards. Their marches seem hurried, like they're preparing for a huge battle that's going to happen. They see Jomi hurriedly barking orders at her guards before turning her attention to them.

"Jomi? What's going on.. Come on, not another one.. We can't even stay here for long.." said Mijo as Jomi nodded. "Yeah.. another one. It's.. just, a small.. event. Uh, the war is.. restarting again in Nuevo León." said Jomi as Mijo and Ikari looked at each other in a bit of shock. "What? No fudging way!" exclaimed Mijo, as Ikari gasped. "What! Another..? Now I get your point, Mijo.. It really happens every important event.." added Ikari, as they both turned back to Jomi.

"Yeah, I'm not sure if this has something to do with the abyss or just a continuation of the political situation.. But, I will inform you as the situation unfolds." continued Jomi, with narrowed eyes. "Um.. Jomi.. we and the others might not be back.. Oh, well I can. But, not the others." said Mijo, as Ikari continued his explanation. "Yeah, we're having suspended classes for the rest of the week most likely.. That typhoon looks big.. So, if anything happens, Mijo is the only one who can help you." finished Ikari, as Jomi sighs at this almost feeling the exhaustion that wasn't obvious before.

"Oh.. that's.. unfortunate. I.. ok. I can do it, I'll handle it. Enjoy your vacation then." responded Jomi, with a twinge of sadness. 

Before, the other two could respond, a sudden earthquake engulfed the dark world as hundreds of abyss monsters started to appear, while the rest of the Dark Pearl, who were curious and also were going to say goodbye to Jomi, arrived at the worst possible time.

"What the fudge!! Really good timing there, fudging muddlefudgers!" exclaimed Mijo as Ikari added, "Fuck! What! Yooo!! Ermm we are so cooked right now..!" as Jomi hurriedly looked around and summoned her sword as hundreds of abyss monsters started appearing. "Well.. looks like we have a problem! I have to get the rest of my army.. Good luck you two!" responded Jomi before waving goodbye then unsheathing her sword to fight through the monsters to get to her other guards.

Mijo and Ikari summoned their weapons, as the abyss monsters quickly started to make chaos in the dark world. "We.. have to... can we even go home?" said Mijo as he started to fight the monsters around them. "I don't know.. but we need to stay here. We can't leave Jomi to deal with this alone... right?" responded Ikari as Mijo nodded.

"Yeah! I wonder where's the others..." said Mijo before they start fighting the surrounding monsters.

_Meanwhile, at another corner, Urda and Rhida bump into each other_

"Oof!" said Urda as she bumped into Rhida. "Ah!" exclaimed Rhida too as she also bumped into Urda.

"Ow.. uh.. Rhida?" said Urda as she looked at Rhida, a bit dazed. "Urda.." said Rhida as she looked around her. "Sorry, I didn't see you there." said Rhida, before a massive sudden earthquake shook the dark world, scaring the other darkners around them.

(For future writing: basically.. just after the whole shebang happens, the catalyst is like.. Cara right? Because she appeared during C6, and this time she got an entire army, along with the cooperation of the Nuevo León Loyalists [idk what i should call them] to do a two pronged attack against Jomi and the lightners, and the dark pearl work together to beat them again, but Cara knows this and scares them again by corrupting Jomi and Mijo, forcing the others to rehash fights Blabla you get it, but it's not finished yet, the climax is for the December exams, so next chapter probably)

"Ugh.. it has been an exhausting two weeks.." said Mijo as he looked across Dajovy at the balcony of Jomi's Castle. "Hm? Really? That must be why my workload increased a bit. The Nuevo León stuff.. Abyss Order.. yeah, now that I think about it, I'm tired too.." responded Jomi, as she leaned near him. "Mmm.. I haven't met Rhida face-to-face in a while.. She said to me in a message that she's busy with a lot of school stuff and can't come here." said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi, disappointed.

"I've always wondered what happened to the ability to do work in the dark world and have it affect the light world too. It's.. odd, that just disappeared after Nuevo León appeared. Maybe that's the reason? But, I can't just.. leave it behind, they're still fighting.." said Jomi, as she moved closer to Mijo. "You think we can enjoy Christmas?" asked Mijo as he laid his head on her shoulder.

"Maybe.. but, I'm too tired to think of cool Christmas parties today.." said Jomi as she stroked her hair. "If you're tired... Just go to bed, I need some time for myself.." said Mijo, as he looked at her again. "I was going to.. but, you're here Mijo. Like I said, I'll always be here for you." said Jomi, hazy with sleep. "Fine.." said Mijo as he grabbed a sofa and put it where they were and sat down as he laid his head on Jomi's lap. "You should be doing this with your girlfriend.. But, you decide on your other self that is pretty much basically your twin sister?" teased Jomi, as they chuckled.

"Y—yeah.. Usually I'm the one that she lays on.. Luckily, we're both tall and.. fit. Yeah, that's what I call our.. ahem. as said by Rhida; _'Absolute Beauty'_..." said Mijo, as Jomi patted his head and smiled. "Absolutely Beautiful? She's a bit biased, considering her relationship with you. But, as the person part of being described.. I agree.. what? Want to discuss it?" asked Jomi, as Mijo put up a thumbs up and answered, "Just don't be overtly sexual about it.."

"Uhuh.. I get it. Anyways, I think she just likes tall people who are a bit nerdy but also awkward and strong. But, that's besides the point. What about the curves? Mijo, honest question, do you think I'm.. like sexy? Like, someone if they see me, would they be sexually attracted?" asked Jomi, as Mijo gasped in her bluntness. "Uh.. maybe? I mean.. you said it yourself.. we are both each other's ideal self.. It would be pretty biased to call you beautiful, considering your breast size, to the hair and.. bottom, I would've said that I liked it." responded Mijo, as Jomi chuckled and exclaimed "Oh right.. haha yeah.."

"Are you getting tired..? Because.. my eyes are barely open, hehe.." said Jomi as she laid on the sofa more comfortably. Mijo switched to a sitting position as he stretched his arms and legs. "Yeah.. I'm going to have to go back.. See you tomorrow, Jomi." said Mijo, as they looked at each other, half-asleep. "Hasta pronto, y ¡buenas noches!" said Jomi, as they waved goodbye to each other.

_Switching to Rhida's perspective_

"Mijo.. Mijo.." mumbled Rhida in her sleep, before she suddenly woke up. "Ah! Oh.. Um.. I thought.. um.. nevermind.. That.. was very intimate.. and.. weird." said Rhida as she felt something in her crotch area. "Ah.. wait.. why am I.." said Rhida, before blushing. "I'm cleaning up." said Rhida, before she got out of bed and headed to the bathroom and cleaned herself up.

She got out and headed back to her bed and thought about what happened, as she looked at her phone, it was 1:00. "Oh. Um.. okay. Guess I'm continuing to sleep then.. But.." said Rhida, before she put down her phone. "I.. need some time to think about what I just did.. Did I dream.. Um.. well, I dreamt about me and Mijo arriving at my house, we laughed, we enjoyed doing stuff, when the night suddenly fast-forwarded and we headed to the couch. Mijo was pretty horny there.. and I can see his.. bulge.. So, we.. um.. well.. we did the thing. It was quick though, just a quick undressing then insert.. then I woke up.. It felt like I was.. um. yeah. I guess I was very excited... Anyways, I should write this down then head back to sleep." explained Rhida to herself, before she typed on her phone's notes about her dream.

Afterwards she turned off her phone and laid down on the bed as she looked at the ceiling. "You know.. Today's after the exam.. Maybe I should meet with him, and the Dark Pearl.. I miss him.." said Rhida to herself as she tossed and turned. "I need to get my sleep though. I've already done so much.. Hopefully I can enjoy December with my friends.. and Mijo." continued Rhida, before grabbing a blanket and wrapping it to her entire body except her head then she slept.

_Days later.._

The whole gymnasium is almost brewing with excitement as the student council holds out the surprise, until..

"Alright.. alright! Of course, there's a Christmas party.. but it isn't just gonna be a Christmas party, y'know.. In December 20.. Are you ready for another _**STUDENT'S NIGHT?!!"**_ the announcer said, as the crowd of students erupted into screams and claps, as another fated day awaits the two lovebirds.

_Mijo's reaction_

He was staring off, not really paying attention until he heard the two key words. **_'Student's Night.'_**

He suddenly snapped out and his brain immediately went into processing mode. "No way.. No WAY?!" Mijo thought to himself, he wasn't the type to scream at joyous moments like this, but he was still ecstatic. "Then.." thought Mijo, as he unconsciously looked in Rhida's direction, their eyes meeting before quickly moving away. Mijo was blushing but he didn't want to check if Rhida did too, he was too embarrassed.

"So.." thought Mijo, as many thoughts of what he could do swirled around his head. "Hmm.. it's two weeks later though.. But, that just means more preparation! I wonder.." Mijo smirked as he already began writing ideas on his phone.

_Rhida's reaction_

Rhida was resting her head on Diminaque's shoulder as the announcements played, she was a bit tired, and couldn't care less about whatever the announcer said until the two key words were said. **_'Student's Night.'_**

Her head suddenly shot up as she heard the words, her heart started pounding as Diminaque looked at her with a knowing expression. "Stop looking at me like that.." said Rhida, as Diminaque chuckled and looked away. Rhida's eyes wandered over to Mijo, in-shock as she looked at Mijo's eyes looking at her. Rhida looked away immediately, blushing.

"Wow.. just 2 weeks.. then.. I'll prepare." Rhida looked at Mijo, hunched over his phone. "I am excited for what you'll do, Mi-mi.." whispered Rhida, before she looked away, thinking of what to do with the information.

_During Tuesday next week.. in the Dark World_

_"We passed upon the stairs.."_

"Oh? Mijo! You're here. Gosh, I thought the christmas break was here, but holyy!" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah, things still rough." responded Mijo, as he sighed heavily.

_"We spoke of was and when.."_

"Oh! Remember~ **Student's Night!** You'll be able to dance on the dance floor, sing to your heart's content, or dance, I don't care, haha. Oh, and Rhida too! Maybe you can even convince Ikari to go, after all, she's your friend right?" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "I'll.. see." responded Mijo, looking away.

_"Although I wasn't there, she said I was her friend.."_

"Don't forget, Mijo.. I'll always be here for you, even throughout all the pain and hurt you're going through, just remember me, your friends, the world you care about." said Jomi, as she held Mijo's hand. "Ah.. okay." said Mijo, as he nodded, still apprehensive and numb about the whole thing.

_"Which came as a surprise.."_

"What? Come on, we both know I accept what your mistakes and what you've done wrong, just remember to always get help and support from me, I might be busy, but I will always make time for you." said Jomi, seeing the conflict in Mijo's eyes. "It's not.. it's just.. I've been.. I'm just so thankful that someone understood.." responded  Mijo, stammering and carrying a heavy load of emotional burden.

_"I spoke into her eyes, I thought you died alone.. A long, long time ago.._

"I.. just.. I keep thinking.. ever since the dark world opened. I felt as though I lost something, and that this.. split, this conversation.. I feel as if, I lost myself at some point, and now.. I'm not so sure that I face a person that I can be comfortable helping and healing.. I.. lost that sense of caring to save others." explained Mijo, as Jomi sighed and nodded. "I.. noticed as well. But I guess, I can't attest to something that only you can remember, so.. I trust you.. told the truth and that.. I can help you, because.. that'll allow you to help me too, it's not any pressure, it's just.. friendship." responded Jomi, as Mijo and Jomi hugged.

_Meanwhile, same Tuesday night, in the Light World, Rhida's bedroom_

"Gahh.. It's beenn.. stressful week.. Even after exams, there's still research.. and.. like, the start of the quarter already? Ayoko na, girl.." said Rhida, as she was on a voice call with her friends. "Yeah, dami eh.. it is what it is.. you have high grades naman, Rhida. You can do it, sis.." said Mack, as Diminaque added with a hint of sarcasm. "Hey who knows? Siguro, if Mijo sees your grades, he won't have a reason to deny you~"

"Hey..! He's not that.. focused on the grades, okay? But.. um.. I gotta go sleep though, see ya!" said Rhida, as her friends bid goodbye to her. "G'night sis! Have a.. **wet** night, hehe.." said Diminaque before Rhida turned off her phone. Rhida blushed slightly at the farewell of Diminaque. "Eh?!" exclaimed as she realized what Diminaque just said.

"I shouldn't have.. eh.." said Rhida, as she laid down on her bed, tired and exhausted. "Maybe I can start planning next week..? Because.. research.. math.."  continued Rhida as she curled up with a warm blanket with a princess design. "Sometimes.. I wish tomorrow would come already.. Hmm.. my.. schoolwork anyway is mostly done.. just.. gotta.. take a nap.." mumbled Rhida, before drifting off to sleep.

_That same tuesday night, in the dark world, Jomi's castle balcony_

_I laughed and shook her hand and made my way back home.._

"Hey, Jomi, I'm going to need some alone time before I head back home, is that fine with you?" asked Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Sure! I'll leave you to yourself for now, then. If that is what you wish, then I shall sleep myself." responded Jomi, before Mijo held her hand and shook it, with a smile. "Thank you again, by the way." added Mijo, before Jomi returned the favor, with another hug before leaving.

_I searched for form and land, for years and years, I roamed.._

Mijo is walking at the midnight of the city of Dajovy, usually lively, the city sleeps tonight, as Mijo continues his walk, reflecting on what has happened. 

_I gazed a gazeless stare. we walked a million hills.._

Mijo looks at the places he visits often with his friends, now closed for the night. He looks at Jomi's Castle, the symbol of authority, of power but also leadership and guidance of the kingdom. He continued walking, seeing restaurants, gyms, food stalls, and a lot of currency based exchanging of goods, also known as shops.

_I must have died alone, a long, long time ago.._

"Who knows? Not me, I've always lost control.. You're face to face, with the man who sold his soul." sang Mijo, reflecting on his school and home life. "Oh no, not me. I've always lost control." continued Mijo, as he sat down on the empty road, looking outward for a while before standing up and turning to head back to his house up on the light world.

_Friday, videocall._

"Hey.. Mi-mi? Is everything alright? I mean.. you're not looking at me.." asked Rhida, as Mijo slightly raised his head as he looked at Rhida on his laptop screen. "Oh, um.. It's.. just.. school stuff you know. I don't pretend to be okay, but you get me. It's the usual.. boring asinine stuff that makes a person apathetic to their work." responded Mijo, as he leaned more back on his plastic chair, as Rhida nodded.

"Oh.. so it is really the same.." said Rhida, as she clearly looked saddened but was trying to hide it. "Rhida.. I.." Mijo cut himself off, he didn't have anything to say that he couldn't guess. "I'm guessing you still have a lot to do next week? You told me there was.. like multiple remedials on top of the actual week's tasks.. I can only guess on how it must have been.. You've never told me.. anything." responded Rhida, as Mijo looked hurt, and was bad at hiding it.

"I.. really didn't.. Didn't I? I guess.. that's just how I am.. It's.. like I never progressed. For how long? I can't tell.. so lost in schoolwork and projects.. I don't want to tell them.. Because.. words can't describe how confused and in pain I am. I'm sorry for.. **rambling** like this.. I just.. feel so powerless. I felt **obligated** to tell you this, but I'm still sorry for dumping my.. problems onto you. I.. should hang up." responded Mijo, before turning off the phone.

_Thursday, afternoon, last-minute training at Jomi's training ground, training console_

"Alright.. pick scenario.. Cara/A-Doctor Attack. Wait.. why is it..? Nevermind. Couldn't Jomi afford to just put 'Abyss Doctor? A-Doctor sounds like a new villain name.." commented Mijo, before pressing the start scenario button. Then, suddenly a hologram of a Cara with her most recently observed gear, appearance and moves appeared, behind her, an assumed appearance of the abyss doctor, with a usual male doctor appearance, holding some magical medical staff.

"Is that what the doctor looks like? Alright. Don't matter." said Mijo, before summoning his sword for the first time in a long time. "I'm getting rusty.. But, I think it's time to practice." added Mijo, before turning to the holograms, staring at him. "Oh right. Default setting is freeze if user not attacking.. I'm guessing she changed that because I'm still rusty.. whatever." commented Mijo, before charging at the holograms.

Cara, with her large pole arm and whip, easily held Mijo at a distance as the doctor behind her   easily pelted Mijo with spam projectiles that made him stay on the defensive. "What the fudge?! I didn't know this was who I was fighting.. I need to find—" said Mijo, before he got hit by a projectile, knocking him back to a nearby wall. "Damnit.." exclaimed Mijo, as he got up and dodged the projectiles, then started parrying them.

"Okay.. Should I.." thought Mijo, before the holograms suddenly disappeared. "Tsk.. Tsk.. Starting a battle scenario, without me?" said Ikari, holding her gun out. "Hey..! You started without.. us..?" said Rhida softly, panting after running to the training ground with Ikari. "Hah? You two?! Where's.. Urda? and Jomi too?" asked Mijo, as he sat down on the ground from exhaustion. "Ugh.. Rhida will explain that, lemme fiddle with this." responded Ikari, before she looked at the training console.

"Huh..? Oh. Um.. Jomi is on preparations.. you know. She's busy. She didn't manage to tell you, due to.. unforeseen circumstances." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, with a faint blush. "Urda decided to help her with that." continued Rhida, as Ikari bothered the two. "Hey hey! I'm done. Can we start now?" asked Mijo, as Rhida and Mijo nodded, with Mijo standing up. "Okay, I get it now. But.. I wonder what the other two are doing.." said Mijo, as he looked at the holograms spawning again, this time, more enhanced due to the users increasing.

"Link start!" exclaimed Mijo, as the two looked at him in confusion, for different reasons. "Huh? What do you even mean?!" questioned Ikari, as Rhida chuckled. "The reference doesn't even make sense. Mi-mi.." commented Rhida, as the holograms finished and then they started to attack.

_Friday, The Student's Year End Party*_

"Alright, so me and the other student council members agreed to.." said Rhida, as Mijo with the other fellow batchmates of students are in a huge circle. "I love Rhida, but no way I am participating in any highschool games. Imma head out." thought Mijo, before Rhida announced, "The game is.. find a group of.. 5!" enthusiastically. Mijo quickly ran off and went to the classroom upstairs.

"Alrighty.. Let me make my daring escape.. They'll never find me here.. Half of them don't even remember a dark world existed..!" said Mijo before jumping in the dark world.

_Into the darkness, on a festive day.._

"Woah.. These new clothes are.. amazing!" said  Mijo, as he looked at his new clothing, a pretty simple baggy t-shirt and pants, all grey, with a blue aura radiating from his magic. He is also wearing a blue fedora hat, with black "Well.. well.. looks like I unlocked the hat weapon huh?" commented Mijo, as he took off the blue fedora, with an intricate golden feather design.

"Wow.. it has been upgraded. Niice.." said Mijo as he looked around him, the dark world being mostly peaceful, but he hears a fight happening to the left of him. He looked at the monsters ravaging some poor guards with a sense of thrill, as he grabbed his hat and launched it to the air, causing it to drop hundreds of yellow coins. The coins while, looking like actual Philippine coins are just replicas, and it says so on the tail side of them. The coins hit the monsters and they're confused while the guards took the advantage and smashed them to pieces.

As the monsters disappeared, Mijo took the hat back and wore it as the guards went up to him, saluting then asking, "Sir Mijo, what... how did you do it?" asked one of the guards as Mijo smiled and said, "It's magic~!" the other guards look amused and nod, they don't pry because either Mijo doesn't know or is not revealing anyway. Mijo continued on his way, moving through the outskirts of Jomi's Castle and Dajovy City with relative ease, he eventually arrives at someone fighting a bunch of monsters.

"Oh, Leviente, I think?" said Mijo, before he went to help him. Mijo and Leviente then easily took care of the monsters together, managing to drive them away. "Woah. That felt way too quick, don't ya think?" commented Mijo, as he looked at Leviente with a smirk. "Way too quick? My friend, we should be quicker, to prevent more of these.. monsters from disturbing Jomi." responded Leviente, as Mijo nodded, getting amused by his friend's practicability. "Alright, alright.. I get it, you're not as.. uh.. enthralled by combat, as hat-wielding, scythe carrying, odachi user like me?" said Mijo, as Leviente replied with a nod that was a bit unsure. Afterwards, they went together to search for more monsters threatening the kingdom.

"So.. how's life?" asked Leviente as they walked around, seeing the not-so-far Dajovy City light up with lights and decorations, as there's a bit of a snow fall at their place. "It's.." Mijo looked around him, seeing the monsters fighting with the guards, then the city, where children were playfully fighting and adults were casually drinking RoyalCo wine. "Meh, fine.." Mijo gestures with his hands, the thumb being placed in the middle, neither a thumbs-up or down. "I guess that's life, huh?" commented Leviente, the atmostphere a bit awkward due to their separation.

At the corner of their eyes, they see another lightner fighting some monsters, they quickly head there and help the person. As they fight, they get a more clearer picture of the person, they were Urda, gunning down enemies with her dual pistols. Soon, the three lightners were no match for the monsters, even a big one appearing, a large humanoid carrying a scythe, only to get triple teamed to disintegration. Soon after, the monsters retreated, leaving the three, heaving from the use of force.

"Wow.. that was.. more.. well.. interesting.. Uh.. yeah.." commented Mijo, panting as the others also catched their breaths. "Uhuh.. didn't need to help me, but whatever, I was.. practicing.. no.. hard feelings." said Urda, as Leviente nodded. "Practicing, is it?" asks Mijo, as Urda shook her head. "N—no... Scratch that, it's just.. I was having fun, like you said, it's interesting.. I mean, I guess it prevents me from getting more rusty?" responded Urda, as Mijo nodded with a slight grin.

"Lady and Gentleman, we need to move." interrupted Leviente, as Mijo and Urda slightly blushed and nodded. They moved quickly, smashing through any monsters stopping them. They saw guards fighting, and so they moved closer and closer to the more concentration of monsters at the east side of Dajovy and Jomi's Castle.

As they moved into the swaths and hordes of monsters, they saw in the middle of it, Cara, watching her bretheren fight them, with a calculated look. "Hey~ You three~" said Cara, as she noticed them and went to them, with a grin, using her long polearm and katana to quickly deflect any shots from them, before using the polearm to deflect all of the attacks, while defending from Mijo's more aggressive melee attacks.

<!--Same ol' reeflective chapter but idk how to write this, this'll be a blueprint for the following weeks-->

## Summary:

Mijo, says good bye to his old life, and with it, some thoughts and events come out like repressed memories. Friends, they shall live out the days of their youth, and celebrations of victory, and loss. For the last hurrah of the old Dark Pearl is here, as time marches on.

## Author's Note:

Hello there, so as of writing this in 09:09 of April 04, 2025 I haven't finished the lore yet but I have finished an outline of sorts or the general idea. I don't think any major themes would change if I did change a few pacing and dialogue, this is sort of a send-off to the second arc/season of this series. Much less.. of an actual completed draft more of a draft that needs to be written now, so I can revise it if I want to. It was the mindset for Season 1 and 2 mostly, so I'm following it now.

As a reminder, this is basically a snapshot of my current 2025 outline if it ever changes. Everything from C1S1 to C8S2. And all the spinoffs that are going to be integrated, if needed be. It's a short quick draft and there's not much complicated battle scenes or at least.. any high effort scene building that is more than what I think is necessary, anyways.. enjoy!

RoyalCo is the orange flavored soft drink, in case you forgor :p

"March 26.. after exams.." muttered Mijo as he wrote on his blue diary. "Hey, it's been a long time that I've wrote on this notebook since I have you in conscious dark world form but.. well, Jomi? I'm.. ugh." said Mijo as he wrote but stopped after not figuring out a reason to not open the dark world. "I should just.. no one's here really. Not anymore." said Mijo as he looked around his classroom. The aircon's humming, an electric fan still running but aside from a few bags and the carefully arranged chairs, there was no one.

"I should go back." said Mijo, as he sighed and got up. He went to his backpack and got his dark world opening pencil. "Here I go." said Mijo before stabbing the ground and dark smoke emerges out. "Let's jump in." said Mijo before jumping in and landing on a platform just for him and his fellow lightners. "Jomi's not here, must've grown tired of waiting for months." mumbled Mijo as he walked to Jomi's castle, being saluted by her guards before getting fully inside.

"It's.. the afternoon. I should go and check her office." said Mijo, before going to the office room of Jomi and knocking. "This is.." said Mijo before the door immediately opened to a disheveled Jomi. "Mijo? Mijo!!" exclaimed Jomi as she hugged her and he hugged her back before separating. "Heya. It's been a while, no?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded excitedly and sat him down on a couch as Jomi grabbed some RoyalCo.

"What's.. what's the situation? I haven't been visited by any lightner, much less you after New Years and Christmas for you.. I've been doing regular goverment stuff I guess, but not much busy doing reconstruction, I'm used to it." questioned Jomi, as she poured them both the orange-flavored softdrink before drinking her wine glass almost immediately. "Oh. Nothing much. More suffering, pain.. bla bla you get lightner schools. Or my school specifically. Ugh. That's likely why they haven't visited you. But, I do wonder why no one else before me visited after exams?" wondered Mijo, expecting a door knock but nothing.

"Yeah.. I was also expecting Urda, Rhida.. maybe Ikari even to jump in, but.. no, no one.. I'm kinda sad about it. After we managed to fully depower Cara and Rasca.. there was barely any celebration.. I—I was actually planning to.. have a cool celebration by next month, and.. there were so many things you and the others missed, I cannot begin to tell you." responded Jomi, as she sighed and drank more RoyalCo.

"Cool cool.. I want to know that, but.. I have a question, do you.. miss us? And more importantly, do you miss the whole.. adventure? Even way back¸ during that Shley or Svetlana thing? I do. I hate what's happening right now. I miss it. I miss being the cool lightning fire guy that went on little adventures with his friends but now..? I feel that it slipped away as we grew older. I don't know. I don't really know." reflected Mijo, as Jomi leaned back on her sofa and nodded.

"Of course. But.." trailed off Jomi, as she sighed. "Burnout, I guess? I do miss some aspects but.. with Cara haunting me from when she controlled our body to her grand plans with Rasca after the first catacylsm... I also like now. Nowadays, where there are only trivial problems.. and.. well.. I guess less threat to my life. I have guards, the whole of Dajovy and even Shley's kingdom.. I guess.. what it comes down to why we were here." continued Jomi as she laid down fully on the couch, adjusting her purple dress.

"Hah. Reflective and observant as always. You're right. It is why we're here. You are now a princess, dedicated to the kingdom of your dreams. You can do whatever trivial and fleeting thing you did now, far from the chaotic mess of before.." said Mijo, with a smile before turning neutral. "My life? I don't know. It's been a mess since the first catacylsm. You know the whole Nirvana and Linkin Park thing? I've only started.. after school started choking me. I.. hate what I went through during those times, and even just last week... What's stopping me, a person with power to slay abyss queens to not turn that blade to myself?" reflected Mijo, as he grabbed a pillow.

"Nothing really. Even I couldn't stop you honestly. I try though. Though if you were really set on dying.. You could. And that scares me. I.. still have guilt from seeing you grow from a naive hero to a cynical and jaded one. Not that any reassurances stopped me from feeling.. bad for you. The one who saved me, whom I cannot save." said Jomi, as she took off her glasses and grabbed her handkerchief from her pockets. "But you did. At least.. not directly. If there was one thing.. keeping me here, it's this world. Of course, I had people with me, but.. I felt.. seperated still. Funny thing, the closest 'being' is myself.. which is you. Rhida, Ikari, Urda and Lauvielle came close.. But something stopped it, whether by fate or myself." responded Mijo, as Jomi shook her head and sighed, her face looking down.

"Ever since.. well.. that fated night between you and Rhida, I've been looking forward of you developing something.. special. Guess I'm the one naive now.. What about that now anyway? What happened since.. the second student's night?" asked Jomi, as Mijo smiled but then turned neutral. "Nothing.. well.. more.. how should I put this? We maintained a close connection before March of this year. Then we both agreed, after a heated.. not sexual, encounter in her house that we decided to postpone our own feelings to focus on the mess of school. After that, we were just kinda trauma dumping to the other person... My last message to her was; 'So.. after, where can we meet?'. Her response was; 'IDK, let's talk next week, maybe Monday, if.. you're available?' I reacted with a thumbs-up. That's it. No lovey-dovey stuff or even any sexual things funnily enough. Only before this year messages had that..." answered Mijo, as he looked at Jomi, she seemed curious. "I'm not saying it, even if you know about us. Down bad stuff." continued Mijo with a smile.

"Fine fine.. Welp, look at the time! My break's over. Gotta get back to work. Are you visiting tonight?" asked Jomi with a smirk and glazed over eyes. "Oh? 15:30 is your back to work time? Aight. I'm.. not sure when I'll be able to get back. Maybe next week. See if others go, okay? See  you, hopefully.. soon." responded Mijo before shaking hands with Jomi and hugging her, Jomi reciprocating before he left the office, with slight burden lifted.

_To the Princess' Bedroom.._

_A knock is heard._

"Mmmnn? Who could be at this hour? Mijo..?" mumbled Jomi, as she got out of her bed, wearing pajamas. She opened the door and Urda was there, looking at her. "Oh? Urda huh? Hey.. it's been a while huh?" asked Jomi as Urda nodded and went inside, quietly. "So.. how's life?" asked Jomi, as Urda shrugged and sat on Jomi's massive bed. ignoring her desk chair. "Cooked. Hard. I mean... after the whole.. party that was.. weird. Weird as in.. like.. dude.. what happened to the whole school, everybody just started to rush everything, PTs, quizzes.. bruh... I mean like.. I couldn't.. uh.. breathe y'know?" answered Urda as Jomi nodded, slowly processing what's happening arond her.

"I get it.. Uh.. so.. do you have anything else to say?" asked Jomi, as Urda thought about it then jumped up as she shook the very confused Jomi. "Hey hey did anyone else visit first? I didn't see anyone make a dark world..!" blurted out Urda, as Jomi nodded and answered, "Mijo. He visited first. Earlier in the afternoon." Urda was surprised, then she pulled back as she laid on Jomi's bed. "Okay... damn. I don't remember anything else.. Honestly, this was very impulsive, I didn't even pull out any reflections or whatever Mijo does.. Oh. YEAH! What about you?!" excitedly asked Urda, as Jomi stumbled. "Uh.. boring goverment stuff, y—you know stuff happens here because of you lightners right?" responded Jomi, as Urda was caught surprised and answered, "Yeah! I was just wondering if I missed anything, anything cool or something.. I guess I shouldn't have come at 2 AM?" asked Urda as Jomi nodded.

"It's just random events corresponding to your world.. valentine's day.. et cetera.. Trust me when I say it's.. boring. And.. I think... it's good to have boring sometimes, y'know?" answered Jomi, as Urda shrugged and went closer to Jomi. "Don't know bro.. I mean, yeah I can goon out my life and play lotta' games but like yeah.. maybe but my life's been like hectic this month.. Heard Mijo's not doing good at his studies since February. Couldn't talk to him about it, busy worrying about my grades heh. Guess I never expected him to fall to my levels.. Wonder what's up with him?" blurted out Urda, as Jomi leaned back to the wall behind her."He's fine.. If that's what you want to know. As fine as you are." said Jomi, as Urda raised one of her eyebrows. "Really bro? That's.. normal I guess, but like the dude always acts normal y'know? I'm not even sure what bro's emotions are anymore.. Happy? Sad? Depressed? Yeah, like.. I know who he is but I don't know who he currently is. He's like kinda detached y'know? Nakita mo diba?! Noong Second Student's Night! He has a new hat, and yet doesn't flex about it? Like what kind of BS he went through to be that.. I don't know.. man.." responded Urda as she adjusted her coat and hair, while moving more closer to Jomi.

"Hey hey.. Move back a bit.." muttered Jomi before Urda chuckled and moved back, then continuing to smirk. "I was wondering, hehe~! When you'd notice, anyway... I don't have anything else to say.. And I'm tired exploring the night city of Dajovy, so.. see ya' Mwah!" said Urda, blowing a kiss to Jomi before leaving. Jomi tilted her head in confusion before going back to sleep, a bit agitated by the situation, in more ways than one.

_Another moment, a wintery afternoon.._

"Yeah. We'd need to develop better cryo resistance to expand outside the city and the outskirts." said Jomi, as she and Sasha looked at the southern region of Kultima, completely covered in snow and ice. "Don't we have a lot of cryo resonators? Is.. there even a way? Our farms in controlled environments with pyro, dendro, geo and hydro resonators working day and night are struggling to keep up with the growth of the populace.. The Underworld has expanded beyond Pebble City and the Furnace Core. Even Weld Town is slowly filling up. We might have to mine more.. but that'll risk.." responded Sasha as Jomi nodded. 

"Abyss monsters. Potentially big ones. We've seen Nuevo Leon. There are bigger and more dangerous monsters than we thought.. It might take decades, to repair that discovered elemental robot near the former fountain that has the power to heat up and potentially beat abyss corruption, at least on this world." said Jomi, as Sasha sighed. "I.. know. I just.. nevermind. Anastasia needs me, see you later, princess." replied Sasha before waving goodbye and running away as another figure emerges from the eternal blizzard. 

"Jomi." said Rhida, as Jomi was holding the hilt of her sheathed sword on her left hand. "Rhida." responded Jomi, before turning around to face Rhida. "Hello.. I.. am here." said Rhida, as she approaches and hugs Jomi, as she reciprocates. "Come, let's go to my castle, I'm guessing you were looking for me?" asked Jomi, as they walked back to Jomi's Castle. "Yeah, Anastasia told me you went with Sasha to the southern outskirts.. I guess they're doing whatever now, right?" answered Rhida, as Jomi nodded. "Mhmm. I have.. work to do, but I'll make time for you, ice princess~" said Jomi, as Rhida looked away. 

"Oh.. Then, can I come back later? I don't want to hold you up in important work, besides.. I just thought it'd be nice to explore the city and other worlds again. I only thought of meeting you when I saw.." said Rhida, before looking at Jomi's eyes. "_him._ The guy who saved the world.. thrice at this point. Also my boyfriend. Mijo Cala. Ugh.. It's the only thing in my mind since I entered the dark world. He must be here somewhere too, but.. I don't want to meet him. Neither does he want to meet me too. Let's.. talk in your bedroom, Jomi." explainsd Rhida, as Jomi nodded before entering the castle.

"Oh? Yeah, sure." said Jomi, as she approached Sasha and Anastasia enjoying some vodka. "Hey you two, inform whoever needs me I'll be unavailable this day, and any paperwork, I'll do later this night." said Jomi, as Anastasia nodded. "Got it, princess~" replied Jomi, before the two headed to Jomi's bedroom. "See? No need to delay whatever's on your mind, Rhida. I can take care of work. Besides, I expect you lightners to visit often anyway..." trailed off Jomi, as she looks ahead to her bedroom, while Rhida looked away, in intense thought.

Jomi enters her bedroom, and sits on her comfy bed, same with Rhida, only that she suts beside Jomi, on her left. "Go, speak!" said Jomi, as she grabs a pillow and holds it to her chest. "Okay.. where do I begin..? I'm guessing he already told you his side.. He always starts something.." said Rhida, as she grabs a pillow of her own and lays on Jomi's bed, staring into the ceiling. "I.. feel like our.. relationship has been.. drifting since.. well, valentine's day I guess. That.. was probably one of the few times we actually had.. a date of sorts." explained Rhida, as she stops for a moment before continuing.

"He.. you know him.. He.. has this drift after that first cataclysm. And.. he's been.. open to me, to you likely.. About how he feels.. guilty for not reciprocating the love I give. He feels that the bond's fragile, and that whenever we have moments of long seperation, he can't really feel.. well.. he doesn't know how to describe not missing someone." said Rhida, before sighing and scooting closer to Jomi. "I.. always tried my best to be his best girlfriend. After the first Student's Night, I really did. It.. **really** sucks how fate separates us again, and again.. I'm feeling really hopeless on whatever we got going on. And the stress of school hasn't exactly helped." continued Rhida, as she starts sobbing.

"I feel this.. sense of him slipping away, from me. That if I don't.. don't.. try hard enough he'll drift and.. he never really recovered, huh?" reflected Rhida, as she wipes her tears with the pillow. "I don't know what happened.. I don't know how to think about it. Should I really.. really.. just.. break off? Devastate him even more? I.. don't want to, we both try.. I just... want to make him happy, and free. Free with me. But.. whenever I look at him, and I mean **really** look at him, it looks like he's.. just faking for me. I don't want him to suffer inside. I want to help him. But.. he.. he often pulls away. And.. even if he accepts, his face of.. intense pain says it all. I don't know him that well either, even after a year." continued Rhida, before going silent as she hugs Jomi tightly, sobbing quietly.

The two are silent as Rhida lets out her repressed emotions. After a while, Rhida pulls back as she looks to Jomi for any comment. "I.. don't really know how to.. respond. It's.. something I've suspected of him for a while now. I think, ever since Nuevo Leon especially, he has started to focus on the abyssal threat more than the journey with his friends. I.. nudge him to that direction often, but.. the only thing I can do is try to help him, I don't know if it.. works. He.. really needs someone though. I can't imagine what he'd be if it weren't for us." responded Jomi, as Rhida nodded, twirling her short hair.

"Yeah.. We.. went through a lot. In the light world, I mean. I don't think taking up the mantle of a hero is his problem. It's.. just whatever school issues he's wrestling with are constant and unchanging." said Rhida before stopping, and ruffling her hair. "Like here. But.. different." continued Rhida, as she looks at Jomi's eyes. "I think I've.. heard him talk to me about it. 'At least here, I can see who I'm fighting.. God knows what invisible monsters I fight everyday.'  It was during the start of your current school year too, after Nuevo Leon, but before the second cataclysm." commented Jomi, as Rhida holds Jomi's shoulders firmly, and shook her. 

"That stupid.. boy.. Ugh.. we just.. we just reconnected and the first person he speaks to is you.." said Rhida, before pulling back and sighing, holding her head. "He just didn't know how to speak to you after months of separation." said Jomi, as she looked at Rhida and gently held her hand. "That's.. what he said.. and I believe him. You know he's the type to be a stranger after months." continued Jomi, as Rhida sighs and nodded, before laying her head on the wall behind her.

Rhida stayed silent before getting up and sighing. "I'm going. I.. need a moment to think about.. about all of this. See you, princess.." said Rhida, turning around and mustering up a smile to Jomi before walking out and exiting her bedroom. "Damn.. these.. lightners really need therapy..." muttered Jomi, before laying on her bed fully as she tries to get some rest.

_At the training ground, where there used to be battles, now sits unusued, except for the occasion where Jomi uses it.._

Mijo walks silently to the ground and summons his sword as he goes to the training console. "Hardest Level. Cara Hologram. Type 2 Variant." said Mijo, before starting the challenge, seeing a Cara with her swords and monsters with tentacles being summoned. 

_Now playing, The Only Thing I Know For Real - MGRR by Jamie Christopherson (for Konami)_

Mijo stares down the hologram with intensity as he prepares to fight. 

"**Let's dance."**

_Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken, I've even forgotten my name..!_

Mijo expertly dodges Cara's cryo ice hail and unsheaths his sword to kill the monsters around her in one, two, three, four and five cuts. 

**"You shall die!"**

Mijo sheathes his sword then goes into light speed as he once again tears the space and time fabric around him, slicing and cutting the Cara hologram into focused and precise pieces before he sheathed his sword, turning his back on Cara, making her move to phase two.

_I don't know the season, or what is the reason I'm standing here holding my blade!_

"Phase 2." muttered Mijo, as he dashed and parried all the electrified ice shards thrown at him. He moved around her as she tried to overwhelm him, but he was too focused and even manage to send a slash to her way, forcing her to dodge and summon her sword to fight him, melee style.

_A desolate place, without any trace! It's the only cold wind I feel, it's me that I spite as I stand up and fight.._

**"The only thing I know for real, there will be.."** said Mijo, before dashing to Cara and slicing her, wounding her left arm. **"BLOOD. SHED.** shouted Mijo, as he and Cara started to clash blades and try to out maneuver each other. 

_The woman in the mirror, nods her head.. The only one.. left!_

Mijo manages to create an opening by deflecting Cara's sword away from her and then using his pyro to burn through her abyssal armor then through her chest.

_Will ride upon the dragon's back, 'cause the mountains don't give back what they take.._

Cara pushes Mijo back, as Mijo parries it but keeps his distance as Cara prepares her final phase. "You're doing yours, I'm doing mine. Phase 3." said Mijo, before charging up his own sword. "Sacrifice.. _Edge."_ said Mijo, as he counterattacked Cara's _Abyssal Reign._ "_BREAK THROUGH!"_ shouted Mijo, before unleashing a fiery slash that decimated Cara's hologram.

Mijo looked at the former place of the hologram and sighed as he sat down on the nearby chairs.

_Monday, March 31. On the training ground._

"See? Now that's easy~! Behold, Pyrostreaker 2000! A revolutionary.. thing." said Ikari as she showed off her new weapon modifications to Mijo. "It's not even done yet! You only told me the dark world was opened last Friday, at 6 PM! So, I had to design it, then quickly implement it this morning! It's a fucking mess alright?" said Ikari, with a smirk as she summoned a notebook out of nowhere and wrote something down. "This is your first strike of the day, hehe..  There'll be more if you keep this up!" exclaimed Ikari, gesturing to Mijo's whole look.

"Uhuh. Haha yeah." said Mijo with a slight grin then as Ikari stood up and walked to Jomi's outdoor magic smithing table, his smile quickly faded. "I'm going to show you! Y—you might be the all-might hero of.. **za warudo** or something, but I can still defeat your loser ahh sword. They say 'Don't bring a knoife to a gun fight' I'll prove it works here!" said Ikari, her back turned as she started work on the table while Urda and Lauvielle arrived.

Mijo sighed and put his hand on his chin as he watched the two go into the console and summon a normal difficult boss, just some random abyss general with monsters as his summons. The two then equip their weapons, pistols and swords for Urda and the book of 'Love & War' for Lauvielle. Urda showed off her versatile aero and dendro switching while Lauvielle showed her mastery of hydroelectro warfare while staying back and avoiding as much close combat as possible. Urda on the other hand was jumping and dashing through the air while shooting and slicing the many enemies that kept spawning. Then he noticed someone, someone who he was waiting for, Rhida.

Rhida, with her friends, but she is noticeably quiet and just nodding as she searches the area. "Oh, he's here." said JR, as Mijo looked at him and nodded, as Rhida turns to where he is and silently nods. "Hey, it's been a long time, huh JR?" asked Mijo, as JR nodded. "Mhm. Let's talk later, your... girlfriend needs you." said JR looking at Rhida's slight grin before leaving with Mack to join Urda and Lauvielle. Mijo nods and sighs as Rhida approaches and sits down next to him.

"So.. how's.. the last month been?" asked Mijo, as Rhida sighed again and looked away. "It's.. fine, I guess. I've managed to study and.. I think I'm gonna do fine. Even be honors. Managed to pull myself through.. everything, 'bout you?" responded Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, keeping his face neutral, even though his eyes told of a different story. "Fine. Got through. It's... in the past now. I.. have a future." said Mijo, voice noticeably wavering.

The duo go silent as they falter in whatever they want to say to each other. Both looking at each other then looking away, lost in thought. Eventually, Rhida sighs and talks first, "Hey." pausing intentionally as Mijo looks at her. "It's.. almost time to move up, no? Next next week, we.. officially finish junior high school..." said Rhida, before sighing as she gains the strength to look Mizo dead in the eyes. "Are you.. _scared?_ You might.. _lose me?"_ asked Rhida, as Mijo was clearly affected, his eyes glistening with tears held back. 

"Of.. Of course.." responded Mijo, as he looks away. "I.. know. I know what's going to happen. You're.. likely going somewhere, far away from here. I.. don't know why I'm staying here." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and wipes his tears, not noticing Rhida's own. "I.. don't.. I don't.. have anything else to.. hide anymore. After all.." said Mijo, as he starts crying, his voice cracking. "I'm but a **shadow**. A **shadow** you'll forget." said Mijo, as he took a few moments to breathe. "You'll move on. I know I will. I did. But.." continued Mijo as he hugged her, as they both silently cried. "It still hurts to move.. **up**." said Mijo, before silently letting the sobs of each other take over his mind, soul and body.

Eventually, Mijo pulled back as the two regained their senses. After a while, Mijo spoke, "It's.. like that. I.. am **scared** too. Scared of not knowing what love is anymore. I've.. been mistreating you, pushing away when I should've pulled you in. For that, I'll always be.. **regretful**. But, time had already passed. I.. didn't want you, you to feel me. All my hurt, mistakes and anger. I'm **sorry**." said Mijo, as he sighed, and looked away, but Rhida pulled his gaze back to her. 

"No. Stay. Look at me. I've.. always been there, y'know. Tried to. I.. wish you'd realized that.. I'd be there always. Every.. time. I would've made time. I swear. If you were there for me, I'd be there too! I.. could've helped you, any **way**, any **form**. It's.. It hurts me, a lot more when you choose to hurt yourself. I can't let go, I.. wish you didn't. And.. I wish I did too, maybe we.. wouldn't be here, crying if we didn't patch it up. But.. no. We knew what we wanted, each other. It's better that way. _Mijo,_ my.. _hero_, please.. let others take your burden. Let me in to your world. Even just for a little while. We might not meet after but.. it'd be the best week of your life. Like you did for me back then." responded Rhida, as Mijo back in tears, let himself cry as he hugged her. This time, Rhida let herself cry tears of.. joy and intense catharsis. 

Once again, the two go silent, the others moving around, letting the couple stay and be together, without interruption. By this point, the training ground was packed with everyone fighting and chatting. Jamise, Leviente and Fexili had entered, Jomi was even there, she was keeping a close eye on everyone, especially the couple. The two pulled back, and nodded as they watched the others do whatever. Ikari and Lauvielle bickering, Urda and Leviente talking about the console, while Jomi is with them, looking at the couple with a smile before turning and joining the conversation near her. Mack and Fexili dueling with halberds, the whole atmosphere vibing with a sense of lightheartedness not seen since way back.

_Next Monday, April 07. After Moving-Up Practice._

"Heya Mijo, Imma be at my Girl Scout Practice, see ya in the dark world!" said Ikari, before leaving the table they were on, in the garden. "Aight, see you there." said Mijo, as Ikari smiled and waved before heading out. "Mhm.. Yeah, a goodbye huh..? We'll see.." commented Mijo, on a text message from Rhida;

Amphoreana (Rhida): Hey uh i wanna talk about our goodbye and yeah just come over to the dark world, my room there...

"Alright." said Mijo, as he stood up and got his backpack. "How convenient, direct entry. Back in my day, you had to pierce bigger 'containers'." smirked Mijo, before stabbing the notebook as black smoke came out. "I hope I don't hit anyone when I go out though." mumbled Mijo, before he got in as the backpack closed its zipper.

Mijo lands in the dark world, and walks to Jomi's Castle. He then walks inside, and arrives at the door of Rhida's bedroom. "Knock, kno—" said Mijo, doing the action to knock before the door suddenly opened and Rhida pulled him close and closed the door. "Missed ya~" said Rhida, hugging him tighter as Mijo after being frozen in place, reciprocated. "It hasn't been a day but.. me too, dearie.." responded Rhida, as she chuckled and pulled back. "Hehe.. you always.. find a way to be funny, even.." said Rhida, before looking away. "Even when it's our goodbyes.." continued Rhida, with a bittersweet smile.

"I.. yeah. It's.. something I do to cope. Not like we've anything else we can do in these.. weeks." said Mijo, as he slightly smiled before heading and sitting on her bed. "Yeah.." said Rhida as she sat beside him. "So.. next week, we'll.. do the graduating thing. I.. I know we've.. basically gone through the goodbyes before, but.. I.. no, we both don't want to pretend. Pretend like after this week, many.. things won't happen." explained Rhida, as Mijo nodded. "Yes. I know my place. What.. ugh.. Whatever **thing** this school has done, I won't and can't really go anywhere else.." responded Mijo, as Rhida nodded.

"I have choices. I want to go somewhere out of this.. **prison**, but then I'll have to leave you.. behind. For the _both_ of us, I'd think it be best if we **left**, but.. I respect **your** decision." said Rhida, as Mijo sighed and shook his head. "It's not that I don't want to **leave**, but.. where would I go? Can I go with you? No. We.. in.. terms of school grading aspects, are very different. You.. in all aspects, _managed_ to keep your grades up. Great job! I.. I'm _happy_ for you." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded but looked at Mijo concerned. "I know you're happy for me. But I can't deny you _feel_ sad too." responded Rhida, holding his hand.

"I.. don't think you'll admit it, but.. you're.. sad that you won't be able to follow me, or that your last 3 months with me were.. I.. **tumultuous**, as you said. When we.. uh.. had a sort-of breaking up at the end of February. I just wanna tell you, from me, and me only, it's.. it's all in the past now. We can't really.. just.. do anything about what had happened. You're.. _a hero and a legend_. Sure, it's in some alternate secret magical world, but you made an impact. Not just me, but to all the lightners and darkners you've **affected**. So please, trust me, when I say you're not just your **grades**, or whatever you.. think you **did**." reassured Rhida, as Mijo's tears fell silently, listening to her.

"Thank you. I mean it, from the bottom of my.. broken heart. _Rhida._ I truly wish we had a life ahead together, but I'm thankful for these moments." said Mijo, his voice trembling before the two hugged each other silently. "Goodbye, my _love_. _Verante~"_ said Rhida, her tears already falling. "_Amphoreana_,  goodbye beloved." responded Mijo, with a bittersweet smile.

_Tuesday. April 08, Afternoon. In the Dark World, at Jomi's Castle, at the Hangout Room_

"So, yeah. That's how Camellya from Wavey Waves 'ruined' my life by making me pull her C6." said Urda, as Mijo chuckled and nodded. "Mhm. You'd be the type to do that, huh? Lemme guess, you don't have any other 5*?" asked Mijo, as Urda shook her head. "I have that butterfly shore keeper and brant guy.." said Urda, wirh a slight grin. "Oho~ Then you barely have other teammates, then?" asked Mijo, as Urda slightly smiled and looked away. "Yeah.. haha." replied Urda, awkwardly laughing.

The two go silent as the hum of thr aircon fills the room, the two left with no topics to bond over. "So.. um.. hey, uh.. Urda." said Mijo, as Urda nodded. "Yeah..? I know what you're thinking bruh, it's.. about the end of.. this.. thing." said Urda more quietly, as she looked up. "Mhm. Yeah. You know.. we've been.. uh..
best friends since.. I think grade 8, you know, and.. we just have a long history with each other. Some.. quite.. um.. intimate, and others.." said Mijo, looking directly at a Urda blushing. "Don't.. remind me, Mijo.. Haha, I was.. very shy back then.. to you, I mean. I'm still shy, just.. uh.. not as much. I guess. Look! Bro, that whole weird rivalry between me and Rhida was.. confusing to navigate, especially when we were blasting enemies as our group grew.."

"Always remember you being.. close, in.. a sorta friendly but also trying intimacy sorta way, I was confused too y'know. Never knowin' what our 'thing' was even after Rhida and me were official. Welp, that was solved during that '**fateful**' night, I guess." added Mijo, as Urda slapped Mijo's arm playfully. "Uhuh! Yeah. That whole.. situation is months from now, approaching a year even. Now I know.. I know that.. I'll.. have to be strong.. in.. developing other relationships, I guess. Like, a sorta social butterfly but antisocial worm, hehe.." exclaimed Urda, glazed over eyes but looking away with a slight grin.

"Gets.. So, my.. 'first mate' of the 'Dark Pearl', ready to bid good-bye to the captain, and your crew, next week?" asked Mijo, with a smile. "Haha.. 'course Captain." said Urda, as she stood up and went closer to Mijo. "Hey, we're friends but we never.. um, did any bro hugs or something.. alone, with only us two. So.. I was—" said Urda, before Mijo hugged her tight, surprising her and making her blush. "Damn.. you.. lemme.. prepare..!" exclaimed Urda before chuckling as they hugged before pulling back. 

"We still have a lotta days. If we meet after those days, that's just the luck o' the sea so.." said Mijo, before Urda interrupted him. "Yep! Let's set sail one more time! And by that I mean go outside and bother Jomi!" The two both laughed and headed outside of the room.

_Wednesday, April 09, Afternoon, Jomi's Castle, Jomi's Bedroom_

"Mmmn... I informed the others.. hopefully no one should be.. disturbing me in my slep.." mumbled Jomi on her pillow, as she was covered in her favorite purple and light blue striped blanket. 

_Three knocks are heard._

"Who's.. that.. please.. go away.." mumbled Jomi, as she turned to look at her bedroom door. "Surprised?" asked Mijo before barging into her bedroom, door unlocked. "Ah?! Mijo!!" exclaimed Jomi, as she rose from her hazy sleep to dazed awareness. "W—what are you.. doing and.. um.. hey! I'm.. kinda.. not.. fully clothed right now, cause' I wasn't expecting.. guests! B—besides, I—I never expected someone to be bold.. except you.. D—didn't know you were going today.." blurted out Jomi, as she gestured Mijo to turn away for a minute. "Aight. Cool. I'll be.. going back to the li—" said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted him.

"H—hey!! Wait wait.. Don't.. just.. just.. don't look at me for a.. until I say to look back, okay?" blurted out Jomi, as Mijo nods and smirks before looking away. "Aight then." replied Mijo, before turning away as Jomi breathes a sigh of relief before quickly dressing up. Mijo is patient, he's just staring at Jomi's calendar while she does her thing. Then after Jomi was done she tapped at Mijo's shoulder to make him turn back. She was just wearing some pink dress she found in her closet. "Okay, make it quick, dude.. I'm—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted her. 

"Nah, expect you won't get sleep this day." said Mijo with a smirk, as Jomi awkwardly laughs as Mijo sits down on her bed. "Okay.. But for real, why did you come back to me? Aren't you on your goodbye streak or something?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded and looked away. "Yeah, I know you know who I've been speaking to. But, all the past.. **reminiscing** has got me thinking. And I wanted to revisit what I.. told you when I entered the dark world earlier..." answered Mijo, as Jomi nodded and got into a more comfortable position on the bed.

"Go on." said Jomi, as Mijo also settled in her bed. "I don't know man, is like this; So.. I've said goodbye to some of the most important people in my life right? And.. right now? I just feel.. ready. You know? One last hurrah, or something. I'm still sad about what the future might be, but.. they've.. made it bittersweet rather than sad. I...hope fate makes us meet again." explained Mijo, as Jomi nodded and smiled. 

"Me too. Those.. people, were important in the lives of the darkners, and the dark world too." said Jomi, before she remembered something and cleared her throat. "Hold on.. I.. have something to tell you.. 'di ba, my castle is anchored to your notebook.. In the light world, so.. basically, the entire modern history revolves around you and your notebooks. But.. that's only for the entrance, the exit.. has some sort of fixed exit in the school, right? Um.. I don't know why. But, it doesn't matter if.. they're truly not returning." said Jomi, as Mijo spoke up.

"I.. know. They.. go, people go. But.. ever since I.. unintentionally made you and.. whatever the dark world is because of my diary.. We're.. inseperable. Just tell me if you figure it out. Who knows? Who knows what'll happen. But.. we're not there yet, Jomi.. And.. I still have two people I want to talk to privately." responded Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Okay, I understand. Lauvielle and Ikari, right? Go. I.. need to go back to bed.. Mijo." replied Jomi, as Mijo smirked and nodded. "Yeah, I.. know what to say and think now. Thanks, for.. trying your best, aight?" said Mijo, before pushing Jomi to the wall behind her and hugging her tightly, causing Jomi to squirm.

Mijo quickly pulled back, as Jomi was a bit flustered. "I'm.. ugh.. Just because I'm the female version of you, doesn't mean you can.. ugh! If **I** did that to you.." blurred out Jomi, as Mijo smirked. "I wouldn't do it if I knew I didn't like it. Besides, it shows we actually trust each other. You know, you can do it to me, and I can do it to you, but we won't killl each other because of it." responded Mijo, as Jomi sighed and shook her head. "You're right.. Ugh, whatever. Go and talk to your _girl_ friends." replied Jomi as she tucked herself into her bed. "My friends who happen to be girls, mhm? Unless you consider your relationship with your advisors.. a poly relationship?" fired back Mijo, as Jomi shouted. "Hey! Just get out of my room already.. Fine, you win, but I won't give that potion you want tomorrow!" Mijo chuckled before waving goodbye and then exiting her bedroom.

_Thursday, April 10, Afternoon. Jomi's Training Ground._

"So, like what I was saying, it's completely bullshit that the game appeals to straight males by it's many many fanservice to them. I swear, the fake ahh drama of the so-called 'censorship' has gotta go. I wanna play and goon as a lesbian, ugh. Where's the inspo anyway? Rule34?!" ranted Ikari, as she and Mijo were walking to the training ground when they bumped into Lauvielle.

"Oh, sorry.. oh? Mijo and Kai! (Ikari)" exclaimed Lauvielle as the other two nodded. "Yeah.. is me, that's right." said Mijo, as Ikari looked at her unamused. "Hello. You've been distracted too much to respond to my calls huh?" said Ikari, raising her voice. "Haha, oh but I did! What I didn't do is follow up. At least, I think that's what you wanted me to do, spamming our dm's like a madwoman..!"  said Lauvielle, as Ikari pouted. "Hmmph, haha..!" replied Ikari before they joined up to go to the training ground.

"So! Who's up for a fight? Oh, Mijo you can probably 2v1, right?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle nodded then slipped and pressed play on the hologram console, forming _Raca, the abyss doctor, hardest version._ "Lauvielle! Shit.. why did you.. wait.. why was this the last one picked anyway? Who—" blurted out Mijo before Urda appeared behind him. "What a.. mess, huh? Don't worry, bro.. I put that!" whispered Urda before she dashed to the group's front.

"And.. how many times you got demolished?" asked Ikari, as Urda blushed slightly but didn't respond. "From my estimates.. one hundre—" answered Mijo, before the hologram fully spawned. "STOP TALKING AND HELP HER!!" shouted Lauvielle as she quickly set up a hydro shield wall sparking with electro as Rasca blasted the currently charging up Urda. Mijo dashed to the two, as Ikari just ran.

"Aight. Let's dance with this bi—" said Ikari before Raca started blasting. "Move!" exclaimed Mijo as he parried one shot as he dashed and slashed the huge dark energy blasts coming after as Urda fired back with aero balls that distracted the boss while Ikari charged up her gun. "Stormfront! Work dammit!!" shouted Lauvielle, as she blasted the boss with her hydrocannon infused with electro. That did little as the boss started counter attacking with spikes in the ground that forced Lauvielle to dodge away.

"Obsidian SMASH!!" shouted Ikari as her gun fired a bunch of molten lava straight at Raca. This was enough that Mijo could go into the ground and launch his ultimate, "_BEGONE_." said Mijo as his lightning fire dashed through space and time to defeat the boss right in front of them. The other three watched as the hologram faded and Mijo appeared, sheathing his sword. "Agh.. Well, that was.. anti-climactic.. huh?" asked Mijo to the other three, as the others nodded in agreement. "Hey! In the OG fight it took like.. a while, and you know, you were.." responded Ikari as Lauvielle interrupted. "Yeah! He knows.. jeez. Besides, Urda, what was the setting for that boss, why doesn't she have phases?" 

Urda thought about it as she went to the hologram console and checked the settings. "Ohh.. Um.. I didn't notice the phases on S2 Tier bosses were disabled.. You know, Cara 2.0? Raca.. Mori." said Urda as the others followed her to the console and looked at her looking at all the bosses stored into the console, along with the setting of 'Phase Unlock' disabled by admin, that being Jomi or Rhida. "Admin disabled?" said Mijo, as he looked more carefully, and saw a 'Jm~' as the signature. "Well.. Safety precautions? We haven't used it since last week, makes sense. Any of you noticed?" asked Mijo, as the three shook their heads. 

"Too busy focusing on my pyro mods to care.. I just wanted to defeat the boss as soon as possible y'know?" justified Ikari, as Urda spoke up too. "Me too.. Damn.. I'm soo rusty and it's barely a few days before we leave again.." Mijo and Lauvielle looked at her quietly before sighing. "Ah.. yeah. I.. didn't.. yeah." said Lauvielle as she looked away. "Mhm.. Speaking of that! Hey.. uh.. can I.. speak to you Lauvielle, alone?" asked Mijo, as Urda raised one of her eyebrows before nodding. "Ohh..! The goodbyes! Right.. Ikari, let's go mess with some Dajovi—" said Urda before Mijo interrupted. "I.. prefer not to, I want to speak to both of them, seperately.. or not, actually.." Urda tilts her head in confusion before Ikari went in front of Urda to respond in kind.

"Yeah yeah.. Gets. You want to say good bye to the two of us, but can't decide who right?" asked Urda, as Mijo stuttered and thought about what to say before Lauvielle responded, "I get it, I guess.. I mean, I have a lot of goodbyes to say too. Come on, if there's.. nothing that we already know, then just make your peace, Mijo.." Mijo sighs as he composes himself. "Okay.." He looks at Urda messing around with her own aero magic and chuckles before turning back to the two. "Aight.. So, yeah.. I want to say good bye to.. our.. whole.. dynamic since the.. computer world." said Mijo, as he directed them to the seats nearby.

"You know, the Crackhead trio? Haha.. I remember it a lot before Nuevo Leon. When.." Mijo sighs as he looks at the two, quite apologetic. "..yeah. I.. drifted. I know that. You know tha—" reminisced Mijo, before Ikari interrupted. "Ah.. I.. well.. I kinda feel bad for saying it like this, but.. I.. genuinely did not notice. I thought I was the one drifting after that.. Like.. uh.. I guess I just thought, you'd notice and try to.. man. I take these granted.." Lauvielle stepped up and added, "Mhm.. Me too. I mean, to be honest, I don't think we've spoken this.. uh.. serious? Since Leviente and me broke up. Uh.. sorry about that, I just.. speak to a lotta people.. and do.. a lotta stuff.."

"Hey maybe you should **focus** Lauvielle!" replied Ikari, as Lauvielle immediately retorted, "I..! I'm trying. I have a lot of friends you know. You know my parents too.. A—and, I—I'd do what you wanted if it was now when you tell me not.. hours later.." Mijo chimed in. "Calm down.. this is like last couple of days we chill.. But.. yeahh.. I just want to say that uh.. thanks I guess. For being there when I needed it, and.. well, I'm thankful that you still think of me in a good light even after all this time."

"Aww.. Of course I do, come on now. Eh.. that's one more strike for your wholesomeness! 20 out of 160!" said Ikari playfully as the other two chuckled. "Eh? What's the other 19 for..?" asked Lauvielle as Ikari looked at her smug. "Maybe if you stopped wandering around the school, dark world and the city outside school.. You would've noticed all the mysterioso 'nonchalant demure' attitude he puts on.." Mijo and Ikari chuckled as Mijo added, "Hey.. that's just me. Besides, you were somewhat busy most of the time, or just mindlessly scrolling 'cause you're tired."

Urda joins in. "Hey you guys done doing the emotional goodbyes? Because I want to visit the city, 'heard Jomi's been working overtime to make some grand celebration and I wanna help her, you two in?" The three nodded as Mijo asked, "Hey wait why am I not mentioned?" Urda scoffed. "You'll help anyway, Jomi's included." Mijo chuckled before the three joined her going out of the training ground.

_Friday, April 11, Morning. Dark Pearl Meetup @ Jomi's Castle, Hangout Room_

"Heyy what's been goin' on, Mijo!" said Leviente as he and Mijo patted backs. "Hey.. yeah, it's been a while, Leviente." replied Mijo, with a faint smile. "Of course 'pre! We haven't spoken to each other in a while. Heyy, I'm wonderin' you think you're an honor?" said Leviente, grabbing some RoyalCo and pouring on the two glasses. Mijo instantly tensed, but forced himself to relax, as he answered. "No. My.. friend, I had a.. '**tough**' time in the last few weeks, I'll be.. light, and say.. I don't.. think so." Leviente sensed the shift, and nodded as he sat down.

"Ahh.. I see bro. 'Pre, if.. there was someone.. doing something to you, **I** got your back." said Leviente, as Mijo awkwardly chuckled. "I—It's nothing like that, bro. It's.. something.. welp, **school stuff.** I don't need to spell it out, and.. I would **rather not**." responded Mijo, as Leviente nodded and drank some of the soft drink. "Alright bro, I won't push it. But.. we are separating, bro.. So, you know.. let your demons out, and forever hold no regret. I've been doin' that ever since the exams ended. I can say.. I.. leave this school with.. welp, some regrets but none I could've done something about." reflected Leviente, as Mijo sighed and brushed his white hair.

"Ugh.. hm. Well.. I'm just.. going to say, I.. should but haven't.. told anyone else about problems I've been having.. Not that I don't want help, it's just.. you'd think your _parents_ would be your first priority for this, but when it's about _them,_ it's hard to.. resolve anything." explained Mizo, as he went silent for a minute before continuing, "Look, I know you might have thoughts to help, but.. you're moving on, so.. it's better to take this as a.. warning, or an inspiration." Mijo shrugged as he drank the RoyalCo on the coffee table, from the bottle directly.

"Mijo.." muttered Leviente as he looked at him sympathetically. "Yeah.. It's better this way." said Mijo, as he looks around, seeing the other lightners arrive, notably Jamise and JR. "Look, bro..  Just.. live. I.. have nothing else to say, Mijo I.. really want to.. but.." trailed off Leviente as Mijo added, "You don't know me..? Yeah. I know. We barely interacted these past few months. It's fine. I just wanted closure, and a goodbye. So.." Mijo looked at his eyes and faintly smiled as they hugged before separating as Mijo goes and talks to JR first.

"Hey how's it been? You ready?" asked Mijo, to a JR, picking out some snacks provided by Jomi on the huge table. "Ready to die? Yeah. But for now, I'm existing." responded JR, as Mijo looked at him for a while before sighing. "Well, I just wanna say goodbyes you know. Just in case we never meet each other again." said Mijo, as JR scoffed and looked at Mijo, with a smirk. "Right. Well, goodbye. May god whoever they are bless you, now go, live your life in peace." said JR, before waving goodbye as he walked away with some chocolate flavoured snacks.

"Heh. Last one, then I'll just.. drink myself to exhaustion." said Mijo as he walked to Jamise, talking to Lauvielle. Mijo tapped Jamise's shoulders as she turns around. "Hey~! Mijo!" greeted Jamise, as she waved. "Uh.. yeah. I'm going to say somethin'. G'bye, friend, I guess. Thanks. For like.. everything." continued Mijo, before Jamise thought about his statement, her face going neutral. Then, suddenly Jamise smiled and hugged Mijo, before pulling back. "Well.. good bye you too then. May we see each other again." before giggling and pulling Mijo to converse with Lauvielle. "Ah. Well.." murmured Mijo, before grabbing more RoyalCo. "Let's enjoy this." said Mijo, before chugging more of that orange flavoured soft drink.

## Author's Note:

Done! Finally. Okay, so there are a few things I want to note: DeltaRune is finally releasing in June, so I can steal from it!! (LOL) But in all seriousness, that might be one of the few reasons I won't be able to finish Season 2 during this time. As of currently, the whole May plan is to finish Season 1. Who knows? I might get some work done on Season 2 to foreshadow Season 3. But finally, we have an ending for Season 2. 

As for other updates, let's see.. We have a couple of stuff I want to remind; Mizo/Rika Saga is indeed ongoing and will get sporadic updates, but most likely will only have one new chapter during this time. And there'll be likely more random spinoffs and drafts published alongside big chapter updates, due to how I write. Anyways, I think this is going to be shorter, so.. g'bye and good day~!
