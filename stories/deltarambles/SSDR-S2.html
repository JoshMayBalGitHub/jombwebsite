Summary: Starts off with a school story, ends with a dark world adventure. Like the old times right?

Author's Note: So, as of currently, the current pre-c3s2 stories have been merged due to me wanting a better story that also fits my current style, so if you were reading c2 it has been moved here, i am sure that you will enjoy this so see you soon, oh and the below is my previous author's note, i didn't have one for c2 btw.

So, there ya go, but i really want to keep this going, but the fact that I am not done with season 1 is kinda stressful and with school, oh man.. Anyways this one's short, because this is the first time i wrote on a notebook instead of a phone's notes app. Hopefully i can have bigger ones in the future. Adios!

It started off as a regular “first day of school”. Old friends like JR and Lauvielle and new classmates for the rest of the year.

Now, Mijo and with 8-Clam, were retired from the whole “dark world” ever since they had their “last supper”. Some of them were done with that type of adventure. Some moved out of the school, some got into bigger and better schools. The only ones still thinking about it were the first ones, Mijo and Urda. Now as “fate” would have it, they were separated.

As lunch time broke, JR and Mijo went to the railings near the classrooms, of course after eating their dinners.

“Hey JR, how's life?” said Mijo.

“It's bad, hahanapin ko yung ibang 8-Clam wanna join?” said JR.

“Yeah sure, hope no dark worlds open-“ said Mijo before a big explosion was heard coming from the bottom floor, as they were on the 2nd floor.

“Ugh, let's go save another dark world." said Mijo.

“I mean, hinahanap natin yung 8-Clam diba?” said JR.

Both of them laughed before quickly going downstairs and seeing the room nearest to the bottom CR.

“Ok, let's see what section's here…” said Mijo.

“9-Oxir…” said JR.

“Ok, hmmm…” said Mijo, searching around the students until…

“Oh, that's why,” said Mijo, pointing to Urda's full name.

“Ok, let's go in," said Mijo, before going in with JR.

“Wait Mijo-“ said JR before cutting himself off.

They woke up in a desert, with Urda and her new friend which Mijo recognized but couldn't remember the name of.

“Hey! Urda and…” said Mijo before getting cut off by-

“Wow, bro, does not remember my name?!?” said Reeb.

“Oh yeah! You're Reeb from Grade 7! I forgor” said Mijo.

“Bruh… We used to play Micnaft in a server!” said Reeb.

“Hi Reebs!” said JR.

“Hi JR!” said Reeb.

“Guys, let's go to the main point, who opened this world, Urda, was it you?” said Mijo.

“Ok, it was me, but like, i was explaining the dark world to Reeb but she wouldn't believe, so I opened one!” said Urda.

“To be fair, di ko siya talaga paniniwalaan, I mean, a dark world that exists? Impossible!” said Reeb.

“Weel that, and i kinda wanted to see what would happen, i honestly expected you, Mijo.” said Urda.

“Well, ok, lets just fix this situation, and go back. Lunch pa lang!” said Mijo.

“Then, we can go back?” said Urda.

“Yeah, yeah, just warn me next time.” said Mijo.

“Hey guys, not to be anti climactic, but andoon lang yung fountain.” said JR.

“Oh well lets go-“ said Mijo before getting cut off.

Two people appeared, they looked like two people who Mijo seen before with Lauvielle on occasion.

“Great, more people.” said Mijo.

“Lets just close the fountain and uh, forgot this happened.” said Urda.

“Wait, yo, why does our phones not work?” said Reeb.

“Yeah, no cell towers here.” said Mijo.

Then they went to the fountain and as they were about to close it,

“Hey, Reeb, what's your magic?” questioned Urda.

“Uh, let's see-“ said Reeb, opening up a menu that looks like… Micnaft?!

“Oh cool, can you make a- wait Mijo!” said Urda.

“What? I'm closing it, oh yeah, the powers? sure, let's see it, Reeb!” said Mijo.

“OK, wash, isn't this op?!” said Reeb, placing diamonds down.

“Yeah, but i bet it will be like super costly or very strong but only on certain worlds, i know it all, well not all, but enough.” said JR.

Then the two immediately met with the rest of the group.

“Hello, fellow people, you know how to get out of here?” said the girl.

“Hmm, wait isn't this what Lauvielle was saying about, like dark worlds or somethin!” said the boy.

“Oh yeah, and the fountain, so i'am guessing you guys know who Lauvielle is?” said the girl.

“Yeah, we, well most of us know who Lauvielle is. By the way, you guys know what your powers are?” said Mijo.

“Uh, we do?! Lets see,” said the girl before opening with a larger gun and a bayonet.

The boy also tried, getting a simple handgun.

“Oh cool, i don't know that!” said the girl.

“Hey guys, we should get going.” said JR.

“Ok, then.” said Mijo.

So the fountain is closing and then they all wake up, 5 PM. Damn it, they were way past over the afternoon class.

“Damn, well lucky chance, let's go home.” said Mijo.

“Ay, well let's go.” said Urda.

“Ok, everyone here, uh, don't talk, don't reveal, basically just don't talk about what happenned here. Ok? Ok. I'm, we are not helping you out if you do.” said Mijo.

“Got it, no words coming out of this girl!” said Reeb.

“Uh sure!” said the girl before getting out of the room.

“Yeah, ok!” said the boy before also going out.

“Oh, I gotta go, see ya' Mijo, Urda, and Reebs!” said JR.

“Yeah, I'am going too! See ya Urda and Mijo!” said Reeb before also going out.

“Uh, i gotta go. I'll be seeing you, soon?” said Urda.

“Yeah, bye!” said Mijo.

SO they both went home, and not together, as Urda went out first. Mijo went last, making sure things were in order.

The next day, Mijo starts out, looking out of a balcony, near the classroom, as the Wednesday cleaners clean inside.

He wonders to himself, the past few weeks, he made a new friends, reconnected with old ones, and he's set with a potential research title approved. But all through it he still remembers the dark world, even though a mishap happened during the first days of school, things slowed down and people focused on their schoolwork.

“Ah man, i wish i could do more but i've been busy and sick, all my friends are, well, busy too, I just wish that i had a chance, wait can't I make my own dark worlds? I've been inactive for this long!” as Mijo rants to himself, the Wednesday cleaners finish.

He decides to go down, because as he was ramblling to himself, the cleaners finished and went home.

The next day in school, he decides to think about it a little bit more, near his previous spot.

“Ok, so where exactly? Maybe the 9-Lit room? Like, where everybody is? But, I dont know what will happen, it could be bad, hmmm, maybe i could try during uwian, kasi it replicates the same situation as before and less people can ruin the secret, ok, thats-“ Mijo got cut off by a new friend of him called Ikari.

“Dude, what are you doing in the past hour? You just stand there and… What?” questioned Ikari.

“I have been thinking of plans, ok?” responded Mijo.

“Plans of what? World Domination?” said Ikari.

“No- something else secret, ok? Wait, actually, can you stay for a bit after dismissal?” said Mijo.

“Why- Oooh- You want me to help you in our AP Project? Well, the answer's no.” said Ikari.

“Please? So you have some ambag—“ said Mijo.

“Oo na nga, sige, sige.” said Ikari.

Then JR suddenly appeared shouting “Si Ma'am!” they all quickly went inside the classroom.

After two classes, it was time for class dismissal, Mijo, Ikari and a bunch of groupmates all actually did the group project but as more people went out of the classroom and went home. Mijo decided it was time.

“Ok guys, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the classroom and—“ said Mijo.

“Oh yeah, I also will be doing that, come on, Mijo.” said Ikari.

“Ok, then cool.” said Mijo.

So, off they go towards the classroom of 9-Lit. They eventually made it with little conversation as they both ran to the classroom. Ikari was first though, Mijo was second.

“Hah- you're second.” said Ikari.

“Yeah, yeah, ok. Wait.” said Mijo.

Then Mijo went to the middle of the classroom, got a ballpoint pen and stabbed the floor, filling the room with darkness.

“Yo, bro, what you doin' you just stabbed the floor and like dark air starts coming out?” said Ikari.

“Yeah, pretty much, now… wh— get prepared for the floor to dissapear.” said Mijo.

“WHAT!? Bro, I'am getting the hell out of here, won't you too?” said Ikari.

“Its too late, the floor, is already collapsing…” said Mijo.

“Bro—“ said Ikari before quickly hrabbing Mijo and quickly getting out of the classroom, but the floor already collapsed. Before both of them fell, they saw a dark sky with no sun or
moon. Only black.

*Darkness Returns*

Ikari woke up in a dark place, only a platform and connecting ones filled the empty world.

“Ugh, that fucker, really put us in this dark- wait, isn't this like, what happened during the first days and accounts from Lauvielle? Shoot, I am in a dark world.” said Ikari.

“Well, dapat naman siguro, merong daanan dito, ay- yung mga weapons ko!” said Ikari.

"Well, surely.. there must be a way— ay! my weapons!" said Ikari, now trying to find her weapon.

Ikari managed to grab her full rifle with detachable sword in the bottom of the gun.

“Oh, that's good, full gun with a free sword.” said Ikari, before moving throughout the floating platforms.

“I mean, dapat naman makita ko siya, kasi, at least sabi ni Lauvielle, naglalakad lang daw siya at nakikita na niya ang kaklase niya…” said Ikari.

"I mean, I should still see him, kasi, at least for Lauvielle, ahe walked until she saw her classmates so..." said Ikari, thinking about her conversations with Lauvielle.

After going through endless quizzes about school rules about drinking, smoking, bullying and more. She discovered a 2-story building with 5 rooms in each floor. A hallway allowed her to navigate each room.

“Well, I have no choice, is either that, or through those stupid quizzes again. Ok, I can do this…” said Ikari before entering the building and opening the door of the nearest room closest to her.

“Hello, anyone there?” said Ikari, to no one in an empty, but organized room.

She moved on to the next one, and the next, no one was there. It looked like she entered after everybody went home. She went upstairs and checked all the rooms to the left of her, no one. She checked the nearest right one, no one, but when she checked the next one…

“Ugh, everybody there?” said Ikari, tired.

“Yeah, that's me…” said Mijo, also tired.

“Woah, what the fuck dude, i almost had a fuckin panic attack hearin' your ass…” said Ikari, surprised.

“You're lucky, by the way, when i landed here, there were a bunch of enemies, like really tough ones, like bottlemen, bullet-hell people, a lot of that type.” said Mijo, while looking straight towards Ikari.

“Yeah, yeah… Hey, how did you open this… world, anyway, I though we were about to fuckin' die!” said Ikari.

“Look, If you heard it from Lauvielle, that means I have been here, before. However, it seems that I have been severely weakened by this world, so first time fighting for real.” said Mijo.

“Ok… That was a lot of yapping, but ok, so you know how this world works? Cool, get me out of here, I wanna go home.” said Ikari.

“No- like I know how they work, but this specific world? Only now, so you're gonna have to follow me.” said Mijo.

“Hey! Well, I guess? I kinda wanna go off on my own.” said Ikari.

“Well, if that's what you want, i also wanna explore and alone for the first time, too!” said Mijo.

“Ok, i guess I'll go to that city over there, have fun!” said Ikari, looking out of a window.

“Yep— you too.” said Mijo.

So both went their separate ways, but—

“Hey, wait- how do we go there?” said Ikari.

“Brute Force.” said Mijo, before slicing the wall in half and pushing it into the rubble below.

“Oh, ok. “ said Ikari before going out the same hole, but going towards a different part of the city.

It was vast and overwhelming for Ikari for even videogames can't prepare you for real, seeing a bunch of humanoid and monster-like beings walking around, though she would meet a familiar, yet strange person.

“Hey! You're a… I mean— Are you with Mijo?” asked Jomi.

“Uh, used to, if you're lookin' for him, he's somewhere in the city, i dont know where but somewhere… to the right of me.” said Ikari.

“Oh. jeez, ok. Uh so have you, like have you had magic-“ said Jomi.

“Yeah, yeah, I already have them, the gun and— wait— who are you anyway? You seem to know Mijo, and you—“ said Ikari.

“I look like him, i know, know. I am Jomi, the princess of the dark. I… met him, with his friends, before.” said Jomi.

“Oh, like, are you part of this world or are you with us?” said Ikari.

“I guess you can call me a part of this world, I am a princess of dark after all.” said Jomi.

“Nice, do you have an empire or a kingdom… or even a castle?” said Ikari.

“Yeah, I have a castle, unfortunately, you haven't seen my largest one in… another world, but I have one here, for some reason.” said Jomi.

“But, wait? I thought you lived here? Why would you have one somewhere else? Do you own multiple castles?” said Ikari.

“Yeah? Technically now, well, we should get going, we need to find him first, though, I can't let anyone stay here as the fountain closes.” said Jomi.

“Ok, sure, got nothing i can do anyway, hey— are there any cell—“ said Ikari.

“Cell service, none. You hear that? Sounds like music…” said Jomi.

“Should be a disco around here, oh hi. Jomi.” said Mijo.

“Oh my— finally,” Jomi runs up to Mijo and said “I have been looking for you in, hours!” said Jomi.

“Yeah, yeah- You're gonna serrmoon me about how irresponsible at mapanganib ang ginawa mo' at papauwi mo kami?” said Mijo.

“Yeah, yeah— You're gonna serrmoon me about how 'irresponsible and dangerous' I am and how you're sending us home no?" said Mijo, in a mocking tone, both a bit annoyed and angry.

“Well, yes. But like, don''t you wanna go home?” said Jomi.

*Silence.*

Then Mijo said “No, NO! I… realized that through all of it, I enjoyed being a hero or just bonding with friends. School life's monotonous and boring.” said Mijo.

“Ay, me too. But how do we get out of here? My dad's gonna be pissed…” said Ikari.

“Yeah, uh you have to help her, its like kind bad to trap her here. just go, we have to discuss this matter later.” said Jomi.

“Ugh, fine. Only her, though. I wanna stay here.” said Mijo.

“No- Mijo you don't understand— You have to go with her. Now.” said Jomi,

*Silence.*

Then after looking down and looking like he's about to contemplate his existence, sadly nodded and looked to Jomi, looking dejected and sad.

"..." then Jomi sighs, then says, "Ok, a deal's a deal. I promise, you can come back. Not now, but soon." then she quietly brings them to her castle in which the fountain is. As they stand before the fountain, Ikari speaks up.

"So... how does this work again?" questioned Ikari, looking at the fountain flow from the bottom to the sky above.

"I am sure you'll eventually know, but for now, hold that question." said Jomi, as she nudged Mijo to close the fountain. Then he gave his heart and light blinds everyone, afterwards both woke up at their respective seats.

"Ugh, oh.. It was a dream.. Just a dream..." said Ikari to herself as she looked around and saw Mijo next to her.

"Hey, hello? Uh—" said Ikari, before checking her phone and realizing it was time to go, got her things and woke up Mijo.

"Hey! How did you sleep like that? We just ran one mile, anyway, bye!" said Ikari before exiting out of class and going home.

As he watches Ikari exit, he also picks up his things and after that, closes the classroom, then he goes to the railings and looks to the school, contemplating that whole encounter. He decides to go home as well, as his dad finally arrives at the school.

For the next few months, he decides to follow Jomi's advice and go on about his life, making friends, suffering in school, etc. Ikari forgot about the whole thing, seeing it as a weird dream she had that one time, until one random conversation in breaktime happened...

"Sometimes, I wish there was a way of avoiding things here... or even resting! Honestly, with the work we get put under, how are we expected to last until Christmas!" ranted Ikari, as she was angry about something about the school.

"Yeah, I agree.." said Mijo, but then he thought to himself, "Wait, what about the dark world.. Does she remember? A good way to test that—"

"Hey dude, you okay? You suddenly looked like you were worried and thinking about something.." questioned Ikari, as she picked up her phone.

"Ah! Oh, sorry. Do you know who.. Jomi is?" said Mijo, looking at Ikari very seriously.

"Hmm, hmm, Nope! Sorry, but whoever that is, it sounds like a made-up name by parents who couldn't think of a way to combine names..." said Ikari, smiling as she also started to play a game on her phone.

"Right, I am going around, talk to you soon!" said Mijo, as he stood up and went to JR.

"Ok!" responded Ikari, as she now focused on the game on her phone, something about space trains.

"Hey JR and Lauvielle, what are y'all talking about?" said Mijo, looking at them.

"We were supposed to be talking about our research, but *she* got off-topic." said JR, staring at Lauvielle.

"Hey! We were.. Anyways, any new _tea_ for us?" said Lauvielle, now looking at Mijo with an excited look on her face.

"Nothing new, but an old one. The **_Dark World_.**" said Mijo, surprising the two of them.

"The dark world? Oh yeah!! That world where I was an arch mage that both heals and kills!" said JR, now excited about something ever since he got his new phone.

"Oh, yeah. The one where I had a bomb and a sword. Honestly, the only times where LV wasn't with me are the only good memories now.." said Lauvielle, feeling a mix of emotions; from being angry, sad and happy at the events before.

"Aww, I am sure you can get over him. Anyways, you can open one, right? Because I always wanted to go back, but I don't know how yet and I never got the chance to, and I didn't wanna ask you, since you probably changed your opinions ever since when Urda opened hers." said JR, telling his thoughts about the dark world.

"Yeah. I think I know the perfect place. Want to guess where?" said Mijo, smiling and putting his hands behind his back.

"The room?" guessed JR, thinking about suitable places.

"Not now, but good idea. But not now." responded Mijo, looking at the people in the classroom.

"The computer lab?" guessed Lauvielle, also thinking about suitable places.

"Close, which one?" questioned Mijo, now forming a big smile.

"*Gasp* WAIT, THE 2ND ONE?! The room next to us?!" said the both of them at the same time.

"Yep, let's go to it now. The room's unused and no one will notice." said Mijo, now looking towards the computer lab, contemplating something.

"Hey, wait, Isn't the room locked? How are we supposed to get in?" questioned Lauvielle, as she stood up with JR.

"Great question, luckily some chairs are being moved for some event, so lets use this opportunity to move in and I'll tell Jomi to make a key that can enter the computer lab and give it to you." said Mijo, pointing to JR as the key holder.

"Ohh right. The event... Anyways— lemme make sure my things are ok, we'll go near the door once we're done." said Lauvielle, as they both went to their bags to get something.

"Ok!" said Mijo, then as Lauvielle and JR focused on their bags, Mijo said to himself, "Now to get Ikari on board..." He went near Ikari's seat and sat down, looking at her then she looked at him.

"Ugh, I have been trying to get my research partners here, since we both have free time and yet they still haven't come.. Fucking seen-ers." ranted Ikari to Mijo as she checked her phone again.

Then at the door is Urda and Reeb, calling Ikari to go outside so they can talk.

"Wait, It's them? Perfect." thought Mijo, as he got lucky that almost all of the people know about the dark world, and that they wouldn't tell.

"Finally! Took you long enough!" shouted Ikari, as she went to them to talk about their robotic research.

"Hey! Mijo! Let's go." called JR to Mijo, as him and Lauvielle stood at the classroom door.

"Right, let's go." responded Mijo as he went to them and then all of them exited the classroom, then headed to the door of the computer lab.

"Computer Lab Two.." said Mijo, before going in with his friends. Then, they closed the room before he got his pencil then stabbed the ground giving rise to the darkness that eventually consumed the room.

"So, this is the prototype, of the robot that can save people from natural disasters. Okay? Now all we have to do is write some answers to some questions..." explained Ikari as Urda tunes her out looking behind her and seeing Mijo enter the computer lab two.

"He— Hey! Are you listening, Urda?" said Ikari, seeing Urda not paying attention.

"Oh, uh yes. Of course! So like we need to answer those so we can try to approve the title tomorrow?" said Urda, now focusing and looking at Ikari.

'Pretty much... Look, I'll just send some questions, and you can *answer* them, now go home or something, I don't care." said Ikari, as she went inside to pick up her bags.

"Hey, Urda, wanna go home?" questioned Reeb to Urda as she also looked at her.

"Uhhh, let's go inside the computer lab." answered Urda as she looked more closely at the lab.

"Oh? Ok!" said Reeb, then afterwards the both of them went closer to the lab.

"Woah, a dark world? Wait, how did— how did he make one and *not* produce a huge explosion?!" said Urda, as she looked inside and saw nothing but darkness.

"Well, what are we waiting for?? Let's go!" said Reeb before she went in.

"Ok, don't disappoint me, Mijo." said Urda, as she also went in.

"Wha— where are they?" said Ikari, before she looked to her left and saw Urda go into the lab.

"Huy! Wai— Huh? What the—" said Ikari as she ran to Urda and saw the inside of the lab.

"Heh? Wait, I... Uh, I feel deja vu... Hmph, she thinks that she can get away? I'll show her!" said Ikari, as she jumps in as well.

"Huh? What is this, eh? Wait! It feels familiar, I can't remember it though..." said Ikari to herself as she stood up from her fall. She notices a group of people talking about something.

"Eh? Those people, they.. hmm, I should approach them, but just in case.." said Ikari, before she prepared her gun, noticing that they looked familiar but radically different.

"Hey! I thought we had an agreement..? Like, it was implied that if one of us were to make a dark world, we would warn each other?" questioned Urda as they stood in a cyber platform.

"Hey! What's going on here? Where are we?!" said Ikari to the group.

"Uh, well first of all, I'm so sorry, Urda. I.. was about to but then I saw you were busy with your research, so I figured you'd know anyway. Uh speaking of that, uh Ikari, hmmm..." said Mijo as Urda nods and looks at Ikari.

"Oh, Ikari's here, uh why? Are you here.. wait. Did you make another one before this!?" said Urda as the group now turns their attention to Ikari and her question.

"Um, well yes— and uh Ikari! We.. are in a dark world, yeah, and it seems to be a CyberWorld that has elements of illusions or something based on the amount of enemies that seem to be dream-related." said Mijo as the group nodded.

"Oh, uh.. I remember now! Didn't we go on one, but Jomi kicked us out?" said Ikari, as the group stared at Mijo.

"Uhh guys! Calm down, um. Yeah like she said, we got sucked into one, and Jomi had to.. rescue us, yeah." said Mijo, as Ikari visibly doubts Mijo.

"Mijo, didn't you stab the ground..? Like sure we got sucked in, but you started it." said Ikari, as the group collectively questioned Mijo, a bunch of voices started piling up until...

"Hold on, hold! One at a time please! Yes, i did do it, I regretted it ok? Jomi explained why.. Anywho, as for the deal, yes I also forgot about that so SORRY!" said Mijo, before he walked away, visibly shaken and almost crying.

"Um.. Huh. So, what do we do then?" said Ikari, as the group is silent.

"We.. should discuss other things, I know him, he uh.. he tends to calm down after a while.. So. this dark world, I think I know what this one is based off, it's..." said Urda, trying to keep the group together.

Meanwhile at Mijo and his thoughts; near the group but far away so that the group's voices are unintelligible.

"I.. don't know why I burst out like that.. Is my development wasted? or I just.. forgot? I don't know anymore... I have to recollect my thoughts and feelings, right now. Before... this world, it seems good on the outside but it looks like the type that would easily manipulate vulnerabilities sneakily. So—" 

"Hey, uh you good? Because we are going now." said Ikari, as Mijo turns around and sees Urda waving hello.

"Y-yeah.. Sure. Um, sorry about that. I am sure the group has filled you in the details right?" said Mijo as Ikari and him walked to the group.

"Yeah, so uh what you missed is... that the world seems nice but is actually bad on the inside, that was the conclusion of Urda and the others, I mean I don't know, I've only been in one and well... you know.." said Ikari, as they walked with the group to the city ahead.

"Yeah, that makes sense. Anyways, we should see what's happening, they have stopped walking.." said Mijo as the group was staring at somebody.

"Hello, lightners! I see that you have come bearing your arms and are on the way to the dark fountain, hmm? Well just so you know, I, the queen will stop you!" said the person that called themselves 'queen'.

"Uh, what's your actual name though? I want to know for archive purposes.." said Mijo as the group stared at disbelief.

"Oh? So you want my full name?? Well my full name is 81LK00HDUS, as I am a computer.. obviously." said the queen, as the group collectively lost their minds.

"Ya know what, this sounds familiar, but I will decide to call you... Lukara, yep. That's the one, I'm just going to write that down..." said Mijo, as the group calmed down.

"Uh, so are you gonna fight us... or?" said Urda as Lukara now looks at Urda.

"Noope! Why would I waste time here, come on trailblazers, there is much of the city, enjoy while it lasts! Oh and have fun with my minions, see ya!" said Lukara before she left and left her minions,  to deal with the lightners.

"Did she just call us trail—" said Ikari, before the battle started with the minions.

"What are they called anyway?? If It's a stupid name, like prammes or progs, I am going to stab the nearest darkner here.." said Lauvielle as JR shields them from incoming damage.

"Hehe, Ikari! You're up. Kill those for us!" said Urda as Ikari gets pushed to the front of the group.

"Ah! What— Hey! Um, I have a gun. That might work—" said Ikari, before shooting it accidentally on a minion damaging it slightly.

"Girl, you are not used to wielding a gun, here imma help you!" said Urda as Reeb decided to intervene in place of Ikari, shooting her crossbows towards the minions, killing them.

"Oh, I thought this was my kill, but whatever, I still need to figure out how this thing works.." said Ikari before Urda started teaching her how to wield a gun as the group moved.

Summary: Broken hearts and feelings, make way for the new era. Things change, and these adventurers have to now face it.

Author's Note: As you can probably tell, I moved the current c2s2 arc to c1s2 because one, i thought that the first one was too short, and two, I've always wanted a bigger story between c2 and c3, seeing as I made them in-story about half a year long so a lot of things should had happened and this chapter is for that, and so this is also a w.i.p. so watch out and see you when i see you, bye!

An alarm is ringing as Mijo awakes to another distressing day...

"Ah shi— Ugh, I swear every time I wake up.. I— hold on, I should probably rush." said Mijo as he goes and prepares his stuff then goes to school.

"Bye-bye dad!" said Mijo to his dad, named June. His dad silently waves as both of them separate for the day. He got his bag down, then went straight for the dark world, now situated at the ever always empty computer lab.

"I.. do not know how to express it, but ever since our 'separation'.. I just felt empty..? Look I know that I have Ikari, I know I still have the others, it's just that.. fun with her." said Mijo, as he talked to Jomi, now his part-time therapist for some reason.

"Mhm, are you still.. not over with.. _Rhida?"_ questioned Jomi, now looking over the training field.

"He— Hu— Uh.. I do not know... My feelings remain conflicted as it did the last time we met.. I honestly do not know, I've been thinking about it.." said Mijo as they sat in a royal hangout place.

"This isn't your usual place, Mijo. I thought you would be.. playing outside?" said Jomi, now looking at Mijo.

"Uh, I just don't feel good today, after the last one yesterday, things have calmed down, and they have been focusing on the domains you made, I said to them that I'll be resting for today, and find me at Jomi's if needed. Also, choice of words, there Jomi." explained Mijo, as he looked at the training field, where JR and Lauvielle are seen talking about something, Ikari about to enter another domain, and Urda and Rhida talking near a domain entrance.

"Don't feel good..? Hmm, that's weird, don't you usually rest after dark worlds, like the other ones, even if it's for.. example, like a PT, because you would and could do them, since you said yourself after that massive battle, it caused you to have to take a break from normal activity and rest for 3 days, like a sick person." said Jomi, now thinking over some books.

"Yeah, I guess, it's about this, and that dreaded coming of the mass demo where there are 3 potential things we have to practice over a month." said Mijo as he lays down on the couch.

"Good luck, I heard that it was hard before, I guess yearly pains?" said Jomi, now picking up a RoyalCo Drink.

"Yes, they haven't even started yet, and they're probably gonna rush through two weeks again. I honestly do not know what to do about that too, ugh everything is tiring..." ranted Mijo, as Jomi looks at Mijo.

"Your life is.. very hard no? You always have to expect the unexpected in the dark worlds as well as deal with the usual stress that comes in being a high schooler.. Huh, I guess that does make life interesting but—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupts.

"—it sure is better than any other option, like imagine if I was so done with my life that I made like a novel that is just this?" said Mijo, unintentionally breaking the fourth wall.

"Well, if you did, are you sure it'll be as unexpected and sudden as this is?" said Jomi, continuing the topic.

"Yeah! Well, I am writing a.. like a diary of this world so—" said Mijo before realizing something.

"Well, you're looking at her. Let's go back to the topic, since you're clearly distracting yourself with novels to cope with the current events. Let's start at Rhida, because.. that's the first one you came to me about." said Jomi, as she pours more RoyalCo.

"Uh, yeah sure... I just... *exasperated sigh* I.. don't.. know?! Ok, like there's this weird dynamic where like every time we look at each other, one of us quickly looks away.. It's weird! And I don't know what to make of it! Like, just like a couple of months after and.. we can't even look at each other?!" said Mijo, feeling lost and confused.

"I.. see. Hmm, well I know this sounds _cliché_ but, like go to her? Seriously.. there's no possible way to get this off your mind, especially here, since she and I collaborated on the domains, so take your chances while it's hot!" said Jomi, as she takes a sip of RoyalCo.

"Mmm... About that. See, there's this feeling, that I can't brush off, what will be her reaction? Will she avoid me? I also have been friends with Ikari, for a while now. And I can't just— ugh... You're supposed to be the more caring, logical side.. Yet, as powerful or even as smart as I can be, I still suck at these parts..." said Mijo, as he takes a cup and pours one RoyalCo for himself.

"Well, there's no better way. I mean, at least you have a conclusion if you gauge what she feels..." said Jomi, as she finished her cup.

"I.. ok, um.. As for the others, I have.. to think about it, but I am energized again. Thanks, Jomi." said Mijo, as he finished his cup, and got up from his chair.

"You're welcome. Go now. I still have a bit more time to myself." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and left.

" *big sigh* All of them.. They have so many problems.. Not even a magical place can take away the problems of their lives.. In fact, it just adds more, but.. *turns to Urda and Mijo talking, with Lauvielle and JR joining in* at least, they're having fun." said Jomi to herself, as she drank a lot of RoyalCo. Then as she pours herself another one, someone knocks at the door.

"Hey..? This is Rhida, can I come in?" said Rhida from outside the door, before Jomi noticed and opened. "Hey~" said Jomi, as they went into the room, and she closed the door.

"So.. what brings you here..? The domains..? or just to talk?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida sits down on the same chair that Mijo was on.

"Haha.. The domains are actually going fine.. But, real talk, sis. You know who." answered Rhida, as Jomi pours a RoyalCo into her cup. "You want?" questioned Jomi, as Rhida politely asked for water instead.

"So.. Mmm.. What, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as she poured Rhida a cup of water. "Um.. I already spoke to some of my friends, but since you're so close to him, and well, you're a friend too, I just wanted to ask.. Is.. he avoiding me?" questioned Rhida, as she drinks the cup of water.

<md-block>
Summary: After the school announced the second intramurals in a year, Mijo came up with a new way of using sports through the dark world's magic but unexpected events happen and he and his friends fall to another dark world...

Author's Note: Not sure yet, where to put this but it's definitely late game. Also just a little bit inspired by real life events, just a little.

An alarm is ringing as Mijo realizes that he's almost definitely gonna be late...

"Shi- not again..." said Mijo as he quickly tried to rush his morning school routine.

He tried to, but in the end, he was late by a couple of minutes, as he heard the flag raising ceremony happen, he knew he was late but had to go somewhere. After moving through the hallway and towards the stairway leading up to his classroom, he puts his bags at his seat then quickly dashes to the computer laboratory next to his classroom. As it was unused, this had been where they set up the dark world.

"Ok, I'm here, let's see if it's open." said Mijo as he looked inside the glass door.

"Yep, ok let's go." said Mijo as he jumped in and  landed in a cyber city, full of computers and there he met Jomi.

"Hi! Jomi, i was a little bit late, sorry!" said Mijo.

"I.. expected that, but still.. you _should_ have gone here a bit earlier like 6:30?" said Jomi.

"Right, sorry again, you know.. parents, and me not sleeping-" said Mijo.

"-at the right time, yes, you should have known to not sleep at 3, isn't that right?" said Jomi.

"Ye- Yeah... Look, i want to discuss with you, the plan i was saying last week.." said Mijo.

"Oh? Ok. What is it, you also said you were bringing your friends..." said Jomi.

"Oh! They must be finishing up, i might need them, i will come back very soon, wait here, ok?" said Mijo.

"Fine. But seriously plan everything, if you keep getting overwhelmed like this..." said Jomi.

"Yeah.. yeah.." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"Ah ok, so it should be- ah crap, I am probably absent because of the whole protection of the dark thing, so uh.. Hmm what are they doing there anyway..." said Mijo.

"So any more announcements? No? Well you all can go back to your classrooms now!" said the person at the stage with a mic.

"Oh no, if they see me... They would have known I didn't attend.. shit! Uh uh, aha! I just have to.. message them at the gc... Right, how could i forget about that, anyways.." said Mijo as he opens his phone and types:

Mijo: @everyone, so uh i am not absent, i just didn't attend the FRC, but the reason is we have a group meeting in the dark world. Anyone available can join, thank you all!!!

"Ok that should, be good. Now it's time to explain to Jomi why they aren't here yet." said Mijo.

Mijo jumps in again then meets Jomi.

"Hey..." said Mijo.

"And where's your friends, hmm?" said Jomi.

"Uhh, they're on their way... Hopefully." said Mijo.

"Hopefully? Sure. But have you actually formulated anything about any plan regarding.. whatever you're thinking about, or you came here to ask me..?" said Jomi.

"Ehe~ yep. I.. I have a plan, just an incomplete one..." said Mijo.

"Oh? Then what is it?" said Jomi.

"Ok, so i got the idea when, they announced the intramurals for this week, and I wanted to replicate that but in the dark world, but I don't know where to start, as there are a lot of factors that i think you can only answer." said Mijo.

"Interesting. What about your friends, besides being the competitors, i assume..?" said Jomi.

"Oh yeah, exactly what you're thinking. Some of them competitors, some facilitators, they choose." said Mijo.

"Hmm, how many? You know i have to make room, food, utilities, and other materials for the sports and.. that takes time." said Jomi.

"Hmm, right now, about only 60 people know of a dark world and have been in one, and most of them are my friends. So that? Though, i want more." said Mijo.

"Well, how many? I think we can still fit those.. 'guaranteed' people, even with extra stuff." said Jomi.

"Hehe, now that's a problem because... I don't know how many, because i want to ask-" said Mijo.

Then suddenly behind them, a bunch of people appeared; JR, Lauvielle, and Ikari.

"He- Hey, Mijo! I.. just came here and.. what is it you wanted to meet about.." said JR, exhausted.

"Yeah, i had to catch up, as _JR_ was running..." said Lauvielle.

"Oh yeah, don't forget about me! I had to run as well!" said Ikari.

"I.. probably shouldn't have rushed you guys, but-" said Mijo.

"It's about the intramurals, i take it you all would have heard about it?" said Jomi

"Yeah, but why? What did you want to ask that relates here?" questioned Ikari.

"So, I want to make the intramurals but here, in the dark world." said Mijo.

"Huh? Now, uh you got a plan for that, Mijo?" said Ikari.

"Hehe, now... That's why y'all are here..." said Mijo.

"Now, that idea looks fun! Mijo, but uh we need a break... Some of them also should arrive like... Leviente... Or Rhida? I don't know dude..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh can we go to your CPU castle, Jomi?" said JR.

"Sure. We'll continue it there, I have some tables and chairs set up already. You all go ahead without us, I have a word to speak to Mijo..." said Jomi.

"Ok!" said Lauvielle, Ikari, and RJ as they head to the castle, walking.

"Ok now you, Mijo, 'Plan'?" said Jomi.

"Uh what do-" said Mijo.

"I said a word to you, now i will speak words instead." said Jomi.

"Jomi!? Let's get serious, please?" said Mijo.

"Yeah yeah, so about that participants thing, how?" said Jomi.

"I.. will find a way." said Mijo.

"Don't tell me you are making a dark world in the gymnasium!" said Jomi.

"Well, that was one, but-" said Mijo.

"But? You know there's a reason why you made it a whole secret and there's magic involved-" said Jomi as they pass the castle's gates.

 "Yeah, yeah, that's stupid. But, what room can i even use, it's not like i can keep making it here, in cyber city. I have to find a perfect spot, somewhere around the school..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, now I don't know, but you'll have to see for yourself. Anyways, we're here." said Jomi.

"Wow, you- you changed a lot in the castle ever since making this my main dark world...." said Mijo.

"Yeah, yeah. Though i have noticed the amount of darkners that are 'visitors' from another land have increased..." said Jomi.

"Hmm, is it anything to do with the increase of students in the computer lab?" said Mijo.

"Probably, I don't mind it, they're usually fine people. I was just curious. Anyways we should head inside." said Jomi.

"A'ight.." said Mijo.

They headed inside to see the others talking at the table.

"I always wondered why it was so fast to go from there to here..." said Mijo.

"Magic, well- more like my castle is just really close to the destination." said Jomi.

"Wait, then like, how do you respond to the visitors?" said Mijo.

"Oh, well.. notice how we passed by the gate while we're talking?" said Jomi.

"There was a gate..? Sorry, Jomi, i just tend to miss some things..." said Mijo.

"I noticed. Anyway, that's closed when I order it to be closed so the visitors would have to go around to the city first." said Jomi.

"Oh ok.. uh hey let's greet them!" said Mijo.

"Hi! Mijo! We were just talking about random stuff." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, like how Lauvielle keeps yapping about Leviente's neck pillow..." said Ikari.

"Hey! I- It's important!" said Lauvielle, a bit flustered.

"So what did you want to talk about Mijo?" said JR.

"Uh, so about here, it's something to do with the intramurals." said Mijo.

"Like the one announced earlier and in the gc?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, like that but here, with magic and cool shit." said Mijo.

"Ah, ok. Uhm, so how?" said JR.

"Hehe, now that's the thing, I don't know!!" said Mijo.

"Ugh..." said Jomi as she facepalms. "We have already discussed some parts, he said he wants you guys to be either facilitators or players." said Jomi again.

"Can it be both?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, Mijo! Answer the question." said Jomi.

"Uh, yeah! As long as someone else is also facilitating." said Mijo.

"So, we have two per.. game. Hmmph, we need more people." said Jomi.

"Hmm, can we ask our other classmates? From our section?" said JR.

"Yeah! I'm planning on accommodating a lot of people. Hmm how many are in the dark world gc?" said Mijo.

"Uh, I don't remember, and we can't check it here..." said Ikari.

"Oh no... Well we have to go back but we might get spotted..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, aren't the grade 7's finally using this room, Mijo?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Right. Um, wait, when do they go here?" Said Mijo.

"Uh, we should go right now, because they can arrive anytime and discover this.. and I do not trust those *children*." said JR.

"But- ugh, fine. Let's go, we can talk about this after school. Y'all have like, delayed pick up driver?" said Mijo.

"I do, but i know that JR usually goes early and it's Monday so..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh- i was gonna say in the gc, but we haven't even informed the rest of them that we have a plan now.." said JR.

"Yep, um, i guess we'll be here uh.. Mijo! You inform JR of our agreements later ok?" said Ikari.

"Got it, let's just—" said Mijo.

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of monsters from the abyss start pounding on the castle's gates. It can be heard all the way to the inside of the castle.

"Ugh, abyss monsters. I don't know why or how they're here but they have raised their activity a lot these past few weeks." said Jomi.

"Well, uh we'll see then hehe, we have to go back so let's kill those monsters!" said Mijo.

"Yeah!" said everybody else.

So all of them headed out of the castle and Jomi decided to open the gates, by saying "Open the gates! Execution Mode!" as some darkners came to fight the monsters.

"What is it, your highness?" said a darkner.

"Kill these abyss monsters, right now." said Jomi.

"Yes, your highness, we shall." said a darkner as they charged into battle.

"Damn, you got an entire army and you're a leader? You have a lot of subjects now." said Mijo.

"Yep, you better go, don't waste our manpower here." said Jomi.

"Ok guys, let's go!" said Mijo before his group attacked the monsters left and right. The group moved through waves of abyss attack, for some reason, more than they had anticipated but they arrived at the light tunnel.

"Ok, that was a bit much. Where did they all come from???" said Ikari.

"The abyss, duh." said Lauvielle.

"Hey—" said Ikari.

"Wait, yeah but more and more the monsters are increasing in their attacks... There might be a catalyst outsider. Just, watch out, all of you." said Jomi.

"Ok, well guys let's-" said Mijo as the others went up.

"Rude. Anyways, bye Jomi! See you later!" said Mijo as he went up.

"Something might happen during the next few days, but I am not sure what it is, before they arrive, I must investigate myself." said Jomi as she goes back into battle.

"Hey guys!" said Mijo as he meets his friends, waiting for him.

"You're here, let's go. It's lunch so we have our school time cut in half." said JR.

"That's nice, well let's eat," said Mijo as he looked to his back, seeing the normal computer lab.

"Yep, let's go." said JR as all of them went their separate ways of eating lunch.

"Anyways, the amount of monsters is interesting, to say the least. But I have to eat so let's think about that later." whispered Mijo to himself as he went and got his food.

"Oh nice, dry chicken with rice and cut hotdog. Hmm, you know, if i only didn't prioritize eating as fast as possible i would have disliked this and the variety too. Anyways, I am just gonna eat now." said Mijo to himself as he looks at this food as he prepares it.

He eats food and after a while, he finishes and pulls out his diary that he doesn't call a diary.

"Alright, so abyss monsters, hmm what type though... Ooh! I saw one that has scythes, what else...  Hmm, i saw one that was just a big guy with an axe... Ok, ano pa ba... Aha! I know! It looks like a two legged beast that has arms that shoot fireballs, or i think it was just rockets... Well, that should be some of the enemies i encountered there.." said Mijo again, to himself as he writes it all down on his diary / notebook / whatever he calls it.

"Hey, Mijo, whatcha doing there.." said Ikari.

"Oh just, writing. Um... why?" said Mijo.

"Oh, nothing. Just bored. Anywho, i know you didn't attend the morning classes, that's why i got us a *Reviewer*." said Ikari.

"You want us, to review? I mean, if there were quizzes we could just—" said Mijo.

Then outside the classroom, a bunch of grade 7's are approaching the computer lab in a line, and all slowly go inside.

"—go into the dark world..." said Mijo as he realized something.

"Yeah, no, it's not an option anymore... Well, you said you could make dark worlds, soo why not here..?" said Ikari.

"Hmm, that's a last resort, also, I.. just don't want more people knowing about it..." said Mijo.

"Ok, well we better review or you might have to forego your secret haha.." said Ikari.

"Hehe, yeah. Let's do it." said Mijo as he put away his 'notebook'.

As they reviewed, eventually time passes and it's time for class. First they had a quiz, and then another quiz. After that, the class was dismissed.

"Goodbye, mam Sant!" said everyone as the teacher left the classroom.

"Ok, Mijo this is our opportunity, see ya on the flip side!" said Ikari as she quickly rushed through the barely functioning classroom door and to the computer lab.

"Wait!" shouted Mijo then said to himself; "Hmm, when i went out, the dark world was gone so if she—"

"Hey, Mijo! Come here!" shouted Ikari as she stands near the door looking at him.

"Yeah! Coming!" shouted Mijo back as he also went out of the barely functioning door to Ikari.

"When are we gonna fix that... Anywho, let me guess—" said Mijo.

"The dark world's gone!" said Ikari, with a worried expression.

"That, um, so— like, the dark world's not gone, but we have to do something to make it appear again." said Mijo.

"Really? But, it's closed... It's locked." said Ikari.

"Wha— oh that makes sense. But, we could just break inside?" said Mijo.

"Sure... But how..?" said Ikari.

*Lauvielle joined the conversation*

"Hey guys, I thought we were going to the dark world, what are you guys still here for?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Um, the dark world's gone..." said Mijo.

"WHAT?! How are we supposed to go in then?" said Lauvielle.

"I don't know!! That's why I'm asking him!" said Ikari.

"Hey, I got this, ok? Just, we need to gain access to the room..." said Mijo.

"How..? That's why we're tryna have a discussion, because—" said Ikari.

"—we don't have any way. Yeah. I know." said Mijo as he looks and sees Sir Joriec and his key to the computer lab. "I think we have an opportunity though..." said Mijo.

"Si sir Joriec?!" said Lauvielle, surprised about seeing Sir Joriec.

"Hi, Lauvielle, Cala, nice to meet you again. We're here just to clean up the computer lab." said Sir Joriec as he goes to the computer lab and unlocks it.

"Hey, Mijo, this is our chance... Let's go right now!!" said Ikari to Mijo secretly.

"Hold on, do we include them? Because, you know..." said Mijo back.

"Hey!! What are you guys talking about, i got... distracted..." said Lauvielle, clearly still shocked by the appearance of the teacher.

"Oh, umm, let's go to the dark world now, Mijo! Use your 'magic method', hehe." said Ikari, with  a sarcastic tone.

"Alright, hold on, they should be—" Mijo said, before getting interrupted by a voice nearby.

"Hey! Is sir Joriec there? Mam Sant is asking me to call him..." said Isatac.

"Yeah," said Lauvielle as she looked into the computer lab and said to Sir Joriec, "Hello po, you are being called by Mam Sant..."

"Ay, Sure. I'll go outside right away!" expressed Sir as he went outside and went with the student to go talk to Mam Sant.

"Good, that's our opportunity! Let's go inside then, Mijo, you will create the dark world." said Ikari before she went inside the room.

"Hey! Wait up!" shouted Mijo, as he tried to grab Ikari by the shoulder making her stop by the door. "I don't think creating a dark world with this many people, is a great idea." he continued.

"Oh, now _you_ don't want more people finding out, how are we supposed to invite people then?!" argued Ikari, as she angrily got in.

"Guys, Sir Joriec is coming back here! We need to go there right now. I can talk our way out of this, just make the world already!" said Lauvielle to both of them as she went outside and looked for potential witnesses.

But then suddenly a huge explosion was heard, and a bunch of other smaller ones as well, it was heard around the school.

"What is happening?!" said Ikari, panicking over the supposed destruction going on.

"Uh oh, we need to go in right now! Jomi might need our help!" said Jomi, reassuring Ikari, as he prepared to stab the ground.

"Mijo!! The world's collapsing, again! So many fountains..." shouted Lauvielle from the door as  she looked towards the balcony.

"Alright, let's beat some abyss monsters." said Mijo as he stabbed the ground and recreated the dark world. 

Suddenly, a blinding white light started to blind the three of them and since the door wasn't closed, it connected with the other worlds which were made with connecting them all in mind. Mijo woke up near the place where Jomi usually meets him, but he saw a battlefield instead.

"Ay putakte, there's so many monsters... I thought Jomi got it..." said Mijo as he looked upon the razed grounds of Jomi's Castle.

Then Jomi appeared, knocking back abyss monsters with her signature pink lightning cut, then slashing a big monster through the middle, then quickly dashing to Mijo.

"Hey, you have come at the worst time! The abyss just started a massive attack and I have been trying to suppress them here, what's the situation at the light?" said Jomi as she attacked a bunch of abyss monsters going towards her and Mijo.

"It's bad!! Its super duper bad!!" said Ikari, only just waking up.

"Woah! didn't notice you there. Yeah, I think a bunch of dark worlds also opened..." answered Mijo, shocked at Ikari as he didn't notice her waking up.

"What?! Hold on, really?" said Jomi, shocked at Mijo's answer.

"Yeah, we got here because of that, and uh we were supposed to be here for the—" said Mijo before being interrupted by Jomi. "Yeah, yeah, the intramurals... Let's deal with these monsters first, ok? Also, i thought Lauvielle was supposed to be here..."

"She technically didn't enter, and since the outside was also being filled..." Mijo thinks, then says, "She must be around here, since she wasn't where we were, oh yeah, my entire school probably is here..."

"Oh no, I fear that they have executed their plan very well, we need to stop them." said Jomi, thinking about her investigation earlier.

"Well, then let's goo!! We have to find other people anyway..." said Ikari, worried about her friend's wellbeing.

"I.. have to go stop them, you all look for your lightner friends, me and my army will march straight to their base at the heart of the abyss." said Jomi before she left them to go to the abyss base.

"Whaa— Really? Now how do we do that??" panicked Mijo, as once again, the world is in his hands.

"We're fucked duuude.." said Ikari as she sits down again.

"Now again, we can't give up. Ugh, we can't save everyone, but we can *try* to. Are you following me?" said Mijo, resolute, yet tired.

"Mmmm ok, I.. have nothing to do here anyway, if the world's ending, i _gotta_ enjoy it with my friends..." said Ikari, as she stands up, then says, "Ok, I'm following you now." 

"Alright, we have a deal. Let's go look for Lauvielle, she should be here, on the way, let's kill some monsters, then." said Mijo, then he unsheathed his sword.

"Uh, sure. Lemme just get my gun out." then she pulls out an unknown bolt-action rifle. "Hey, wait why does my weapon always change when I go here, meanwhile that's the same sword I saw back then??" 

"Well, I don't know, I guess you just haven't figured out what you truly want as a weapon.. But that's fine. I'm sure you'll learn quickly, we should go save Lauvielle as soon as possible." reassured Mijo, looking at the gun very intently before looking at Ikari.

"Yeah, hmm let me try it out on these enemies," as she guns down 3 enemies in 3 seconds behind Mijo. "Woah! You're right!"

"Hmmph, they are interrupting this rescue mission, hold on." Mijo then sheathes his sword again then suddenly starts slashing all around the monsters around like a bubble around the field. Then suddenly glass shatters around him as he appears again, with his sword unsheathed again.

"WHAT?! Why do you have that and i have.. this?! Stop, please stop flexing on me already!!" Ikari, surprised about the events that just transpired.

"Eh? I mean, you could try yours, let's see it!" said Mijo, again reassuring her.

"Uh sure," as she focuses, a bunch of monsters appear again, Mijo moves behind Ikari to see what she does then she says, "Guns away!" as she perfectly executes an execution of all the monsters in 5 seconds, decimating all of them.

"That.. was a bit exhilarating, but I.. feel fine, except for the fact that I am a bit tired right now." said Ikari, feeling exhausted but she can still stand up.

"Now, that's what we call a magic burst! Damn you did that first try— I mean second try so that's good!" said Mijo, complimenting Ikari's skills again.

"Second try? Heh, you got defeated that first time so you would definitely remember, haha."
answered Ikari, as she sits down on the ground.

"Guys! Over there! Some survivors!" a voice rang out from the left of them, they seem to be lightners as well, likely about the same grade level as them.

"Huh?! Sino kayo?!" questioned Mijo, as he was surprised about the lightners.

"Ah! I— It's you!" said the person in front of them as they called into their group, "Urda!"

"Huh, Urda..?" said Mijo as he looks into the group as a figure is going to the front

"Yep! It's me!" shouted Urda excitedly as everybody lowered their guard.

"Hey~ Its been a long time, speaking like this... I wish it wasn't these days that we do..." said Mijo.

"Yeah, I agree. Honestly, I have been getting to know my section a lot and... it was thanks to you that i got here in the first place.." replied Urda.

"Ah don't worry about it, anywho... We still need to find out what's happening and how to stop this whole mess, I figured you know something about this?" said Mijo, getting back to the point of their meeting.

"I mean... last chance to talk before apocalypse is nice... But yeah, I am wondering where's your section cause' as soon as the sky was turning dark and an explosion happened, I immediately rushed and gathered all of 'em before getting fully dropped in.." said Urda, with a bit of questions for Mijo as well.

"I.. wasn't prepared for that—"

"No shit sherlock, yeah, how do you have a plan for this?! I mean, a catastrophe like this has never happened before, right?!" said Ikari, cutting off Mijo and being a bit loud at the same time.

"Well, actually—"

"Are you about to tell me that you have gone through _this_ before and haven't had a backup plan?" questioned Ikari.

"Alright, calm down. Yeah— Mine was an on the field decision either... So, it isn't his fault, since we did win last time, but— well looks like we have to go searching for the answers again..." explained Urda.

"By the way, have your friends have been fighting the abyss monsters the entire time?" questioned Mijo as he saw the background of a mix of people battling some abyss monsters.

"Uh yeah, why did you think I had the time to talk to you two? Well we better go, we might find some clues along the way so.. lets go!" said Urda as she helps Ikari get up.

"Oh well, I wonder what's happening with Jomi..." said Mijo as all of them walked over to the group.

*To the Depths of the Abyss*

"Show yourself, before I go ahead and find you instead!" taunted Jomi as she goes with her army around the abyss base.

"Well well, It has been a long time, Dark Princess..." said a figure in the dark.

"Wait, I know you! You're the _Abyss Doctor!_ You only hid in the abyss instead of being defeated..." said Jomi as she realizes who she's dealing with.

"Hehe.. Smart as ever, hmm? Ah well, I'm afraid this is just a test, an experiment to see a possibility, now—" 

Jomi tried to surprise the _Abyss Doctor_ with her lightning slash but he was protected by a shield and so she was knocked back.

"You think I wouldn't have a shield on? Or you just don't want to know what you came here for... answers..?" said the _Abyss Doctor_, in a mocking tone.

"Alright, fine. I am here for answers, but that doesn't mean you can hide there forever!" shouted Jomi but still negotiating with the abyss.

"Oh yes certainly, you only cut off the most important piece.. my data is complete. But, judging by you.. I think you know when we'll meet again... Goodbye, and have at 'em!" said the _Abyss Doctor_ in a sassy and mocking tone before leaving, as a horde of monsters spawn from everywhere, the floors, his former place, everything in the room.

"Men! Fall back! We can't risk dying here without good gains..." ordered Jomi as she and her army retreated from the abyss.

*To the Darkness*

"So what did you get in the AP quiz? I messed up... quite badly in some of the questions..." said Mijo.

"Wait, no— was it because of the graph? You told me that earlier!" said Ikari.

"Damn, I feel bad for you.. I mess up sometimes, it just happens haha.." responded Urda.

After chatting for a bit they saw a human figure, throwing out bombs and stabbing anyone that came close to them, she looked like a witch in form.

"Uh hey! Who are you?" called Ikari to the unknown person.

"Woah— Ah! It's only you... You scared me there Ikari..." said Lauvielle as she stopped due to them arriving.

"Hey, might wanna—"

Mijo got cut off before Urda ran near Lauvielle then killed the abyss monsters for her.

"—kill those guys first..." 

"Ugh, Mijo, stop yapping and start attacking!" said Ikari before also joining in on the action.

"Ok, Fine!" said Mijo as he also joins in.

Afterwards, the amount of abyss monsters dwindled then they stopped after the last one died.

"Gu— Guys..." said Ikari as she is breathing very heavily.

"What..?" questioned Mijo as he also breathes heavily.

"Let's... lie down.." said Urda as she faceplants on the floor. Everyone lays down on the floor.

"I.. think you guys exhausted yourselves a bit much.." said Lauvielle, concerned about her friends.

"Yeah.. Its fine... We got you, Lauvielle." said Urda, picking herself back up.

"I have never done _this_ much fighting in a while..." said Ikari, breathing heavily and laying on the floor as others were sitting instead.

"Anyways, it seems that there are barely any monsters left..." said Mijo, looking around the group.

"Urda! Urda! Someone is calling you, their name was like Jomi or something..." called out Reeb, as she was running towards them.

"Oh! Jomi has returned and is probably looking for us, come everyone." said Mijo, getting up on his feet.

"Yeah, we're going.." said Urda as she does the same.

So slowly, they all got up and started walking back to where the Oxir group was along with Jomi and some of her army. They arrive and this is the conversation that followed:

"Oh finally, you arrive. Anywho, I need a huge favor and.. I need to speak with Mijo. Privately."
said Jomi, resolute yet shaken by the events earlier.

"Ah sure! Guys wait here, and uh go with Urda, Ikari." said Mijo to his group.

"Ok... Let's go Ikari." said Urda, secretly having some questions about the whole thing.

"Uh, sure..?" said Ikari too, questioning the private conversation secretly.

"Let's go guys! Let's give them space, anyways, what was..." said Lauvielle as Mijo walks with Jomi to a place without a lot of people, near the castle.

"Ok, so here's the thing, I don't want to have them worry and... I don't think I can hide anything from you, so let me just tell you this right now..." explained Jomi, so tired and yet still wants to talk.

"Hmm ok. I understand. Ok, I won't reveal anything unless you tell me to." assured Mijo, curious about what Jomi is about to say.

"Ok, so... no sugarcoating, the _Abyss Doctor_ is back." said Jomi, straight to the point.

"What?! Now?! Uh... Do you know what he is doing back?" questioned Mijo, remembering past events.

"He seems to be preparing for something, a plan of his i don't like. He said that his data collecting is done..." said Jomi, summarizing what the doctor has said.

"Oh no, do you know when he is coming back? Because he is definitely coming back for something.." questioned Mijo, as he began formulating plans in his mind.

"Hmm, he didn't tell me. But I know it already. It's the day of your year end party." answered Jomi, also thinking about plans.

"What?! That's like 3 days from now, why did he suddenly appear now, instead of later in the week??" said Mijo, worrying about the intramurals.

"I don't know. But I have to keep the patrol and scouts up if he comes back. You should be wary of him when you plan your intramurals." said Jomi, as she makes a smile that only tired people make.

"Ah, that. Well I guess I should have a plan tomorrow, no ambitious stuff though, we got delayed by the abyss..." said Mijo, already thinking of some board games that can work.

"Ok. Let's head back. We should close the dark worlds by this point." said Jomi, as both of them started walking back to the group.

"Hmm, I wonder why this hasn't affected the whole 'worlds colliding if too much darkness' stuff that you were saying about..." questioned Mijo as they walked.

"Well, after the cataclysmic event that happened during grade 8, i made _sure_ to make it so that isn't a problem. I used _some_ abyss powers to do that however, which I can't say I regret doing, but I could have done better purifying..." said Jomi, as they finally finished and met with the others.

"Hii! Your back!!! Finally, we were about to go to you, because we were getting bored here.." said Lauvielle, getting bored standing around and talking.

"Yeah, let's just close the other dark worlds, then we can go home..." said Mijo, exhausted but determined to see it through.

Then JR and Rhida arrive at Jomi's Castle with a bunch of remaining grade 9 alive.

"Hey, so this is the last one, right Rhida?" said JR, counting the fountains written on his paper.

"Yep! and this looks like the most important one." said Rhida, looking at the castle and the fountain beside it.

"Hey! What's up!! JR and.. Rhida!" said Mijo with a smile, noticeably at JR.

"Hey. We are done here, and this is the last one, so. let's close this one?" answered JR back.

"Yeah, sure. This was all unexpected anyway. See you, soon?" said MIjo, now turning to Rhida.

"Uh, yeah... C- Can you do it, Mijo?" questioned Rhida, surprised about Mijo looking at her but still managed to blurt out something.

"Y- yeah.. Hold on." answered Mijo, surprised about Rhida too.

Then Mijo went and closed the fountain by offering his heart, then light covered all of their eyes and then, they were back in Honrato. Mijo was laying down on the floor of the computer lab.

"Ugh, man, I hate these types of transitions... Anyway..." said Mijo, as he got up and surveyed the room to find Ikari getting up and Lauvielle near the door, also getting up.

"What, does this happen every time? Man..." responded Ikari, looking around her.

"Yeah, well... when there's no reasonable way for us to have fallen asleep... At least according to our research." said Lauvielle, also looking around.

"We should go out, it is almost night, and we should go home." said Mijo, as he looked outside to see a blue sky almost getting dark.

"Oh... It's 5:30 PM.." said Ikari, as she looked at her phone. "Well— I better go, this meeting has gone longer than I wanted, so imma go— byeeee!"

"Bye, Ikari!" said Lauvielle and Mijo as she went out of the room.

"Uh, how about you? I still have to wait a couple of minutes..." questioned Mijo to Lauvielle, as he started writing down something.

"Hmm, right now! I bet all of my compadres in the service are ready to go, so.. I'm going too, stay safe!" answered Lauvielle before she also went out of the room.

"Ok, I should go as well, hmm," said Mijo as he looked for the lock... "Ah! There it is. Now let's just—" said Mijo as he goes out of the room then says, "—lock it. Ok then, i am getting out of here." as he locks the room.

"Hey... Mijo." said Rhida as she looked nervous and worried about something.

"Oh, uh— Hi! there..." said Mijo back, as he was surprised, then he started to feel nervous too.

"Let's keep this convo short and secret. Do you... still have feelings for me?" questioned Rhida as she looked down.

"Huh? Well, in truth, i don't know myself. I had this on and off thing with you and I don't know how to express it... I feel like whenever I get close to you, I mess it up, someway... How.. about you?" answered Mijo, as he cried a bit and kept looking at her.

Long silence, then he heard cries from her, as she said, "I.. didn't know you felt that way. I thought that I only had this thing for you and you didn't reciprocate... and I was fine with that. But now... I see. Um.. Well— you probably know that I have started seeing other people right?" also answered Rhida, with a question too.

"Hmm, i had suspicions, but since I thought that you moved on and I respected that, I just put it on the back of my mind. I have another question, do you think I have been seeing other people as well?" said Mijo to Rhida, now looking at her eyes.

"Y— Yeah... At first, it was Urda, then when the next grade came along, it was Ikari.. Is it all true? I still have no 'boyfriend' by the way, if that's what you were wondering..." said Rhida back, now staring back at Mijo.

"Well, I have suspicions, but I think both are truly just my friends, one is an unconfirmed asexual and one is a confirmed lesbian, so I don't know really... As for me, I also think of them as friends. Truly." said Mijo, now posing like he's thinking pretty hard.

"That's.. fine! Ok, this convo is over, as my parents are waiting for me... Bye! Uh, see you soon!" said Rhida, saying goodbye to Mijo and going downstairs to go home.

"You too!" said Mijo, bidding farewell too,he also went down, making sure to not look like they are together.

As he went home, he thought to himself, what caused this sudden conversation with Rhida and how this would change the dynamics between them. But as he got home and changed to house wear, he decided to focus on the intramural plan he was working on, tomorrow will be a blast.

He woke up the next day, feeling tired but as soon as he looked at the date, he exclaimed; "It's Intramurals Season!", so off he went to get ready and after that, go to school.

Soon after arriving, he quickly ran to his room to set up the stuff but he opened the classroom door to see darkness...

"Oh, damn. Well that makes sense, I am kinda late, and I doubt they waited for me... But who opened it?" said Mijo to himself before he jumped down into the darkness, seeing him transform to his usual dark self then after landing, seeing the huge castle ahead of him.

He went to the castle and to the Great Hall in which he found 9-Lit chilling in the Dining Area and Jomi and Ikari, speaking to each other.

"So this is how you open it? Coool!" exclaimed Ikari, reading a book.

"Yeah, be careful though, we don't want to break the balance ok?" said Jomi, looking at Ikari.

"Hey guys! So, who opened this one?" greeted Mijo, looking at Jomi.

"Oh, uh it was... Urda? She said to 'not worry' and that she 'got it' So i let her go into the room and when i looked at her, she already stabbed the ground and the dark world was opening... then i met her." said Ikari, pointing to Jomi.

"Ah nice... Any new games there, or do I have to bring mine?" said Mijo, as he checked his bag for his games again.

"Ah! Now for that, I have an answer, your games are already in!" exclaimed Jomi excitedly, grinning to Mijo.

"Whe— Oh.. well i am going to check inside the dining area, see ya!" said Mijo, before he took off.

After he went in, he saw his creations, such as the _'Mijo's Monster Battle V.2.4'_, the _'Dance of CHAOS V1.6'_, the _'Extreme Ball Drive V.1.1'_ and the _'Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4'_. He also saw Jomi's creations such as the _'Test of Resolute Will V3.0'_, the _'Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta'_ and the _'Jomi's Magical Sports V1.0'_

"Damn, she really did? Ok, hmm, oh hey! The dining wall board! It looks like the advertisements for the games are here... Let me see..." said Mijo, as he looked and found the advertisement poster of Jomi.

    <summary><i>The Dark Intramurals</i></summary>

    ## Mijo's Monster Battle V.2.4
    A game where you use a monster with special skills against other people! Like Rooster and Onikabuto Fighting, you get to somewhat control your monster in real time combat! There are different modes, such as the beetle mode, where you fight against AI and their special types of beetles or you can fight with another person and their beetle, (appropriate level and skill is counted) or free mode where you can experiment with any monster using our creation screen, (appropriate level and skill is also counted) to spice stuff up a bit!
    
     ## Dance of CHAOS V1.6

    ## Extreme Ball Drive V.1.1
    A game where you push big blue balls using repulsion magic to put them into your area scoring points, this game also features special big yellow balls which offer more points and wind clusters, which when touched, give you enhanced jump for 5 seconds. This is the ultimate ball competition!
    
    ## Mijo's Trickshotting Competition V1.4
    A game where you shoot enemies far away by using an AWP-styled gun to score points, with limited ammo and time. There's two game modes, level and endless. Endless is self-explanatory, you get given a map where you constantly reposition and shoot enemies before the timer runs out, and there's escort and normal. Escort is where you kill enemies because there's a transport you have to protect from damage. Level is two parts, escort and normal. This time enemies are limited but there is still a timer.

    ## Test of Resolute Will V3.0
    A game where you go through domains, a place where you can fight waves of enemies at limited time, or added time through killing them. There are three types of domains, the endless (The Dance of Fate)  where you try to kill as much of the waves of enemies possible before you run out of health or you run out of time. Next is the Daily Domains (Daily Battles(, in which, everyday, a rotation of domains are set and you can go battle them to get day-specific rewards. Lastly is the 'Memories of Adventures' in which you go through levels made by Jomi and others that recreate their adventures such as the _Abyss Doctor_ fight, the Shley fight, and the all-favorite Jomi fight. 
    All of these modes give you lots of rewards which allow you more space and energy to train and fight. Enjoy the domains, and see you when I see you!
    
    ## Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta
    A game where you experience the turn-based combat with more immersion! Right now, there are only the test domains, which are copied from the levels of TRW, so the combat can be tested.

"Oh wow, she put the details of my games too? She's gotta be one of those fast learners I suppose, hmm, although there's barely a tutorial.. Whatever, I am sure it's accurate, I've checked already!" said Mijo to himself as he looks around and checks out the games.

"Hey there Mijo..." said JR, surprising Mijo as he looked at the games.

"Oh! JR! Hi there, so uh what game you wanna play, i wanna do the TRW thing, it's basically shingen impact!" said Mijo, who's now looking at JR.

"Ok. Hmmm, what mode and what weapons?" said JR as he walks with Mijo to where the game is.

"I want my normal swordsman and electro type.  How about you? Default as well?" said Mijo, who kept walking to the game with JR.

"Yep, mage and electro. Shouldn't we get someone else to get good elemental reactions?" said JR, now at the game selecting difficulty and mode.

"Yeah, i know the two, Jomi and Ikari." said Mijo, now done at the selection screen and is now waiting for other players.

"Ok, I'll stay here and wait for you, go get them!" said JR, now swiping to the enemies screen.

"Ok." said Mijo before quickly going to where Jomi and Ikari were.

"Here's how to beat it, trust me, you can do it. I have tested the games and they're quite fun and challenging!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari reading the tutorial of TRW level 10.

"Bro it is literally impossible, I mean that Shley is pretty dangerous and it's too OP! I don't even have a shield user unlike your fight!" argued Ikari as she looked mad at Jomi.

"Hey guys! Wanna play some TRW? Trust me, i have JR with me so it's gonna be a blast." said Mijo as he looked at both of them about to explode.

"Sure! I would love to, I have a lot of testing to do anyway, like Ikari here saying that the Shley 1v1 is too hard." said Jomi, looking at Mijo.

"Wha— Are you trying to imply something? Anyway, yeah. As long as I don't have to do those fights by myself with Jomi watching from the sidelines..." said Ikari, now calming down and looking at Mijo.

"Hey! I was making sure that I recognie the errors in my code, ok?" said Jomi, now looking at the ground.

"Good, now uh I guess you can all make up and don't have to almost kill each other..." said Mijo as the three of them shared a small awkward laugh and after, move to JR's position.

"Hmm, this is easy, this one, I have been there... and this one, looks challenging.. Oh hey guys!" said JR as he looked at the enemies at the level enemies screen.

"Hey! JR! So let's start the game now?" said Ikari as she very quickly got to the screen and started picking her character.

"Hmm, I'll pick my normal fire and sword type, how about you, Ikari?" said Jomi as she picked her character.

"I'll go with this heart thingy, looks like my element color which is green." said Ikari as she picked her character.

"Oh that's dendro, nice! Hmm your dendro gun and our reactions will make this easy... Quick, JR start it since you're the first one to put your character in!" said Jomi as she looked at Ikari then to JR.

"Uh thanks?" thanked Ikari, confused to what Jomi said.

"Yep, I agree. Anyways lets start the game." said JR as he pressed play and all of them get transported to a familiar domain to the two of them.

"Woah, coool— this is what you've been working on, I was wondering..." said Mijo as they went towards a red key in the middle of the arena.

"Yeah, yeah.. All of you are familiar with this so let's start it." said Jomi as she touched the key and suddenly a bunch of enemies started appearing.

"Ok. *Let's dance!!* " said Mijo as they charged head-on towards the monsters.

Author's Note: DONE! Let's gooo! WE HAVE FINISHED a special chapter since this one even though not even complete has a lot of lore stuff that I will take in mind when writing the first ones. This is so cool! I was planning to do a students night chapter but I might continue Chapter 3, anyway, stay tuned here if I ever make that chapter. Also, I get it, some of these are 'inspirations' but you'll see how I improved upon it. Anyway.. Peace out, and see you!

<!--Chapter 4 draft, subject to change due to likely revision of earlier plot points-->
<p id="C4"><md-block># C4 DeltaRambles: The Student's Night</md-block></p>
<md-block>
Author's Note: 
Edit 1: So.. I have combined two drafts of c4 into one so hopefully that works out. That means that currently, we are going with thia draft, but trust me, you'll see the fruits of this soon.

Oh, so originally this was a spinoff, but I realized it would be better as a chapter, so it is now! Though, the lore... Oh well, you'll see what I wrote soon enough.

The food fest is an excuse to refine some of Mijo's parts that I want to pay off in S1, and also, since this is a spinoff, I don't have to think much, which is great, since I don't have a lot of time to think too, hehe..
 Anyways, enjoy!

Summary: Mijo is suddenly surprised when there's an event in both worlds, one week full of fun as the quarter wraps up, a students night along with a food fest. Unfortunately for our lightners, the abyss has other plans than let the lightners enjoy the week...

On a random school day, as Mijo is practicing his fighting, using a variety of weapons: 

His main sword, his katana; for quick slashes and quick parries more on deflecting, it can summon slashes and is the best sword when he is in the air, as he can summon slashes and when he goes down, knocking back enemies using the force from his sword. He also uses this as his main ultimate as he uses it to dash through reality to cut through the veil of time and space. 

His odachi, for slower and stronger slashes, used for piercing and more aggressive plays. It usually involves more aggressive parries that you initiate and win, or you battle and win. He also uses it to pierce enemies and is better against shielded enemies. His ultimate here, involves slowing time to hit more precise slashes to decimate enemies.

He also wielded other weapons that he returned to the owner, before replicating it on his training ground, such as scythe from Sasha, and snake sword from JR.

"Every single day I become more like Dante... Well.. Eh, nothing could be done about it. I like my katana, but so many weapon variety to have fun with is fun too sometimes.. But my greatest would of course, always be my katana.." said Mijo to himself, as he practiced and practiced on a group of enemies.

"Hey there.. You bored yet, Mijo?" said Jomi, as she comes into his training ground.

"Maybe? Why..? Anything interesting happening outside here?" said Mijo, as he slashes through a training monster.

"Yeah, a lot actually. That's why Urda isn't here, or even Rhida, they're both buying.. i don't know, but they seem to be enjoying the event in town." said Jomi, as Mijo looks at her.

"Oh, ok. What's the event then? Combat related?  Hopefully, but I don't mind if it's not.. i guess." said Mijo, as he stopped the fight and looked at Jomi in anticipation.

"Well, it's not combat—" "Awwww", interrupted Mijo as Jomi continued, "—But! It has food! Good food! All affordable, trust me."

"Uh, sure.. I don't have anything else to do anyway, especially during these times. Well, let's go. You coming with?" said Mijo, as Jomi said, "Well, that's why I am here... Let's go!"

As they head off to the fountain, Mijo is thinking about something.

"Hey, wait a minute.. We're going to the light world? Aren't you a darkner?", said Mijo, as Jomi nodded, but responded, "Well, yeah. You'll see." 

"Wait.. You'll.. But why... Ok. Fine." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"He then looks to the school, from the second floor railings, until he realizes something.

"Gosh, it's been a year! We probably should celebrate one year of the dark world. But.. I need to.. organize first. Which.. I don't want to do. Too tiring." said Mijo to himself, as Ikari notices him again, staring off into the distance.

"Hey! So..! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you still be training in the dark world?" questioned Ikari, as Mijo looks at her.

"Uh.." Mijo looked at the gym and saw no notable event happening, then he continued, "Hey, uh is there like a food fest or anything gonna happen in the gym?" questioned Mijo, as Ikari thought for one second, then said, "Nah.. In fact, I was just about to go to the dark world.. Soo... Can you accompany me there?" 

"What? Really..?! You.. are a grown woman, well.. somewhat. You can go there by yourself! Don't worry, Jomi is there if you need anything, and.. I think Lauvielle's there, not sure." said Mijo, as Ikari reiterated, "Ehh, come on, it's just when going in, I trust you're busy, so no more than that! Ok?"

Mijo looks at the gym, again. Then looks at Ikari and says, "Suure.. You know what, let's go to Jomi's town. I wanna see what Jomi was talking about some food fest stuff.", Ikari smiled then she said, "Yeah! Then we can check out what Jomi is cooking! Her cooking is fire!!"

Then they go to the dark world, where they fall to where they see Jomi going out of her castle and looking at them.

"Hey! I just came back from some.. important stuff and I was about to go here to wait for Mijo, then you lot dropped in!" exclaimed Jomi, as the two notice her and are happy.

"Hey!!! Jomi!!!" said Ikari, as they both hugged as Mijo smiled and said, "Ikari, you just missed 1 week, you miss her that much? Oh, and.. thank you, Jomi."

"What?!; Can't hug a friend?!" responded Ikari, as Jomi smiled and said, "Y— Yeah. Sure. Um, let's go!" said Jomi, as they stopped hugging and started to go to the actual town.

"Soo.. uh.. what do you do here, anyway? I've never actually questioned what you and Jomi do in the dark world, except for what you always tell me, Um.... 'training' is what you always say.", Mijo thinks about what to say, but Jomi responds for him, "He.. says training but he's usually there to reflect and fighting is therapeutic for him, as for me, I manage the town here, and I research new magic stuff sometimes."

"Woah! That sounds cool! Can you make a custom gun? Cause' this one—", Ikari brings her gun out, "—is kinda.. boring? Look, I've *never* fought a lot but, this one.. It's like— it isn't the best! So.. can you make me one, please? I'll even give you... ummm.. what do mayors want..?", Jomi smiled and looked at Mijo, as Mijo nodded at Jomi, and said, "Well, you should ask her? But, since I have known her since.. well, for a year or so, I know that.. she would like a pendant."

Ikari turned to Jomi and said, "Is this true? This guy—", she pointed to Mijo, then turned back to Jomi, "He's smart.. But he can often misremember things.. So, since he just said, 'ask you', I am asking you, so what ya want?", Jomi laughed and responded, "Well, this is one he remembers.. A pendant with.. a flower! Oh heck, even a witch hat, just having pendants to wear looks nice!"

"Noted. Anyways, you got something to say, Mijo?", as Ikari noticed Mijo about to say something before closing his mouth. "Uh, nothing. Just.. thinking about something.", said Mijo, as Jomi speaks up, "Yeah.. don't bother. If he wants to say something. He will probably have already said it."

"True. But.. it's still worth trying. Anyways, I am sure it's nothing. Let's continue!" said Ikari, as Mijo and Jomi smiled, as Jomi notices. "Yeah, I agree. Let's make this last.", said Jomi, as they continue heading to the town.

They go into Jomi's Town, and see Urda at first, checking out some new games that were included with the food fest, such as the old classics, Test of Resolute Will and Mijo's Monster Battle and the all-new Trailblazer's Traveling Bus, formerly known as Jomi's Turn to Battle Beta.

"So.. As you can see, Mijo, I have been working with Rhida, JR and Urda to update these games, and it's been fun!" said Jomi, as they walked to Urda, before she heard them and said, "Yeah, I didn't have much input on the game though, my job was visuals and sound effects, which.. look for yourself!", then she pointed them to the new game.

"Woah... This is.. interesting. At the same time as the light counterpart too.." said Mijo, before Ikari commented, "Hmm, I wonder, does anyone even play 'games' here when we have magic?"

"Well, as you can see... It's still appealing! Since, however you change it, danger, risk and potential harm is still at play when it comes to these parts, so these games exist! It has also been.. a long passion of ours to make an actual game people enjoy.." said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Mhmm.. Well, you wanna join us, Urda?" questioned Mijo to Urda, as she thinks for a second then says, "Another time, dude."

"I understand, let's go, Ikari." said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other and headed deeper into the streets of the town, where Rhida's group can be found eating near a huge food stall.

"Hi! Rhida!!" said Jomi, as they both hugged each other, and Rhida said, "It's been a while, Jomi! Like, actually.. Ever since we finished wor last week, I have never seen you! Even in your castle! At least, when I went there.."

"I am *sooo* sorry, Rhida..! Like, I was busy these past few days, I couldn't even talk to Mijo! Oh, um... yeah! Here's Mijo, and that's Ikari...!" said Jomi, as they look at the two, with the others, like Mack, who was smiling and Rhida, who was pretty awkward seeing Mijo, but she still had a smile, but it was obvious as to what she was currently feeling.

"Hi, Rhida. Long time no see too! We haven't, well at least not... well, um.. talked, since the last world ending disaster..." said Mijo, as Ikari commented, "Jeez, you two have so much tension...", forgetting that everyone heard her.

"Haha— Wh— What do you mean— Ikari? It's nothing! Just.. mmm..." said Mijo, before Jomi got them out of the awkward situation by saying, "Yeah, but.. you know how it is.. No one's willing to say anything, so why bother?"

"Yeah! Why bother.. *ahem* Let's change the topic! Something a bit more light hearted! Like, like.." said Rhida, as she struggled to come up with words to say, until Fexili said, "How about the good food! I just _loove_ the churros around here, it's great!"

"Oh yeah! That, and the fruit drinks, especially the one that sparkles!!! Oooh just thinking about it, hey! Let's go there!" said Rhida, as Mijo said, "I would, but we won't be following just yet. See you around, Rhida."

"Oh, um.. Ok.. Guys, let's go!" said Rhida as Rhida's group headed off to some other stall, as Mijo's group explored the area, finding more stalls and more food, until it was time to head home.

"Wow! I did not expect that burger, the cheese, and the meat! I mean, it's a homemade burger, but it still tastes amazing..!" said Mijo, as Ikari laughs and nods, agreeing with his statement.

"Awww.. It looks like it's time to head home.. It's 17:00, Mijo.." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked and Ikari's a bit confused but then after a while gets it.

"Ohhh! Shit, it's 5! I better go back now, see you two tomorrow, bye!!!" said Ikari, before running, to go back to the light and towards home. "Haha.. Well, you still got an hour, what do *you* wanna do?" said Jomi, as Mijo looks at Ikari slowly disappears out of view.

"Ughh... I guess it's time to say something about.. what exactly were you busy for those days, hmm?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi has a big exasperated sigh, knowing it was inevitable. "Just.. the usual... Abyssal problems, as always. It's not going out of control, yet. But.. I suspect that.. we aren't out of the danger yet."

"What?! I thought the *Abyss Doctor's* threats were null when he didn't show up at the year end party?!" said Mijo, as he looked increasingly more worried, but Jomi has more to say, "Yeah, and that is because of me. Sorry. _He_ is always vague so I can't exactly predict him, and.. you understand me right?! I was exhausted and was already swirling with hundreds of information, there's a mistake that happened there..."

 "I.. never confronted you directly, since I was just thankful that there weren't any abyss monsters, but how can I trust you, if you can make mistakes as important as this, how can I know if I should be scared?!" said Mijo, as Jomi stares off, not looking at Mijo, feeling guilty and pressured. "I.. can't say anything else, other than sorry, I'll be better. But, you have to trust me on this one, ok, this time it will also be just you, so if anything happens it's between *you* and *me.* Got it...?"

"Ok, got it... It was just a week ago, when the world was in darkness, again..." said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. Jomi added, "Yeah, and you know what's the worst part, _he_ knew exactly where I was at during that time, tired and exhausted, it's probably what he wanted me to be when meeting him..."

"I see.. So, you have any non half asleep thoughts on when *he* is coming back?" questioed Mijo, as Jomi laughed and said, "Ah.. That is exactly why I didn't initiate, I have no answer. Let's meet back up tomorrow, during the student's night." 

"Ah! And— and, where exactly? I can't just show up in full suit and tie and go into the dark world, you know how these things play out..!" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed again and said, "Well, let's just say.. I made a little spell that makes this easier...", then Jomi casts something that affects Mijo's mind, Mijo feels this.

"Ugh.. You can do this?!" said Mijo, as Jomi turns to her serious face and says, "Of course. We are connected, and this magic is only powerful since we are so related.", then she smiles, "That means this is special for us!"

"I... trust you, but what will you do with this? Does it affect the mind..?" said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and said, "It allows me to exist in your mind, simple."

"WHAT?!" said Mijo, as he checks the time, and realized it's time for him to go. "Ok, ok.. Mhmm... I'll see you I guess.", as he left the dark world.

He went home, and he and his mother prepared for the student's night tomorrow.

"Alright, so me and your sis agreed on this, it's reusing your year end party clothes, but with a bit more specialty in the night. Look here." said May, his mother, as he looks and sees, blue polo, with long sleeves, a black coat, long dark blue pants, and a grey tie.

"Oh nice. Well, it looks good to me." said Mijo, before May looks at him, she laughs a bit. "Everything looks good to you, nak, even the pajamas."

"Haha.. That's just how I roll. Anyways Imma go to my computer, it seems everything's prepared.." said Mijo, before May nods, indicating acknowledgement.

As he goes to his computer, in his room, he sees Jomi, dressed in a black gown, with her hair stylized longer, going over her shoulders, and she has no glasses, she is sitting on the small sofa in his room.

"Hi there!" greeted Jomi, as Mijo is surprised by this and says, "H— huh?! Oh— it's you. So.. um, how are you here, again?"

"Oh nothing much, just in my empty room connecting to you using magic, hey, I picked out _my_ best clothes! Uh, where are we... anyway?" explained Jomi, as she looks around the room. "This is my room in the light world, as you can see, it looks eerily similar to the dark one.", said Mijo, as he showed Jomi around, holding her hand.

"Oh wow, this house... Mmm.. Well, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo sits on his revolving chair, "Programming, my light hobby. I write the scripts here for the dark games as well as my journey in the dark world, hey, it's genuinely a good fantasy story for other people, I just changed the names around for the lightners, like here!"

"Mmm? The characters... Oh, Joshua and.. Darice? The first sounds like you got a name that started with J that fits you, the second looks like a name that was made from switching letters around..." said Jomi, as she looked at the character list.

"Yeah! I know right, creative naming on my part, but.. are you not going to tell me what the *abyss doctor* is doing?" said Mijo, as Jomi pulled away from him and said, "Mmm.. Like I said, tomorrow. I just tested the system to see if it is working."

"I see. Well.. Oooh! Wait I have a question! How do other people see me, like when I hold you?" said Mijo, as Jomi sits down and says, "Haha... Well, it's like when you interact with me, like let's say you try to float by stepping on me, you think you are.. But the moment that someone sees where I am supposed to be, you fall." said Jomi, as Mijo is shocked by this, "I see, so I'm basically delusional. What if I don't notice the person, what happens?"

"Well, it's obvious. You're just moving normally, like if you're floating, you're just on the ground. The sensation of falling only happens to you, you just return to your senses." explained Jomi, as Mijo processes what Jomi said, and says, "Aight, cool. That's all I have to say, you can get out of my head now."

"Sure. I only have one more thing to say, what I am doing is best in the light world, as this type is hard in the dark world since your magic can unintentionally prevent my projection, which already is causing a lot of my energy." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and looked at his computer, "Aight, that's good to know, but.. now that I know it's possible...", before Mijo looks concerned thinking about the multiple ways of using it.

"Everything's possible, Mijo. Anyways, Imma go, see you!" said Jomi, as she left Mijo's mind, letting him procrastinate on school work alone. 

*Alarm starts, it's loud, and it's singing "When I look in the mirror, can't believe what I see—"*

He turned off the alarm, and woke up the next day, tired but excited as today was the anticipated student's night, so he excitedly did his morning routine and headed off to school, as there was still the morning and afternoon preparations to do.

"Alright, few things to do, I guess. Well, Jomi, follow me if you want." said Mijo to himself in the mirror as he went and did his morning routine. Then as he got his clothes, his mom called him, "Hey! Your night clothes are on the right and the day clothes are on the left!", Mijo responded, "Got it!", as he started dressing using the day clothes.

He went to school, dressed up like a 'writer' from the 1890s because that's what the clothes insinuated from his style of choice. Then he went to the dark world to visit Jomi, before the event. His wear in the dark world is a bit different, changing to a more dark blue and dark yellow coloring on his coat and jacket, respectively.

"Huh, she isn't here.. Weird, she always met me here.. Maybe busy? But.. she said... hmm.." said Mijo, as he looked around, he decided to head inside Jomi's castle, but as he went closer, some of Jomi's guards noticed him and approached him.

"Sir Mijo, unfortunately, your Majesty has gone out on an expedition into the abyss for 'important business'. This is what the princess told me." said the guard, before Mijo looked shocked and worried.

"I.. see. Have you come across any lightners other than me?" questioned Mijo, as the other guard shook his head, indicating that he was the first one.

"Huh..? That's weird. Well, I suppose I'll go inside, then." said Mijo, before the guard stopped him and said, "Sorry, the princess has also ordered us to stop anyone from going inside the castle, including you, sir."

"Weird.. Alright, guess I'll have to see her another time. Bye!" said Mijo, as he waved goodbye to the guards before going back to the light world, seeing Urda and Lauvielle talking.

"Are you sure, he's gonna dance with you?" questioned Urda, before Lauvielle answered, "Nah, I don't have faith in him now, especially considering before."

"Hey gals! Um, you uh seen the dark world?" questioned Mijo, as he sees the clothes of the two, both having casual attire. "No, actually, we were just about to jump in after talking, what? Another problem?" responded Urda, having mixed feelings about the question.

"Yeah... Jomi is apparently not allowing anyone to her castle and the town, she's on some.. quest."
