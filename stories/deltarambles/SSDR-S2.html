Summary: New School Year, Mijo and the gang are at it again?

It started off as a regular "first day of school". Old friends like JR and Lauvielle and new classmates for the rest of the year.

Now, Mijo and with 8-Clam, were retired from the whole "dark world" ever since they had their "last supper". Some of them were done with that type of adventure. Some moved out of the 
school, some got into bigger and better schools. The only ones still thinking about it were the first ones, Mijo and Urda. Now as "fate" would have it, they were seperated.

As lunch time broke, JR and Mijo went to the railings near the classrooms, of course after eating their dinners.

"Hey JR, how's life?" said Mijo.

"Its bad, hahanapin ko yung ibang 8-Clam wanna join?" said JR.

"Yeah sure, hope no dark worlds open-" said Mijo before a big explosion was heard coming from the bottom floor, as they were on the 2nd floor.

"Ugh, let's go save another dark world." said Mijo.

"I mean, hinahanap natin yung 8-Clam diba?" said JR.

Both of them laughed before quickly going downstairs and seeing the room nearest to the bottom CR.

"Ok, let's see what section's here..." said Mijo.

"9-Oxir..." said JR.

"Ok, hmmm..." said Mijo, searching around the students until...

"Oh, that's why," said Mijo, pointing to Urda's full name.

"Ok, let's go in." said Mijo, before going in with JR.

"Wait Mijo-" said JR before cutting himself off.

They woke up in a desert, <ins>with</ins> Urda and her new friend which Mijo recognized but couldn't remember the name of.

"Hey! Urda and..." said Mijo before getting cut off by-

"Wow, bro, does not remember my name?!?" said Reeb.

"Oh yeah! You're Reeb from Grade 7! I forgor" said Mijo.

"Bruh... We used to play Micnaft in a server!" said Reeb.

"Hi Reebs!" said JR.

"Hi JR!" said Reeb.

"Guys, let's go to the main point, who opened this world, Urda, was it you?" said Mijo.

"Ok, it was me, but like, i was explaining the dark world to Reeb but she wouldn't believe, so I opened one!" said Urda.

"To be fair, di ko siya talaga paniniwalaan, I mean, a dark world that exists? Impossible!" said Reeb.

"Weel that, and i kinda wanted to see what would happen, i honestly expected you, Mijo." said Urda.

"Well, ok, lets just fix this situation, and go back. Lunch pa lang!" said Mijo.

"Then, we can go back?" said Urda.

"Yeah, yeah, just warn me next time." said Mijo.

"Hey guys, not to be anti climactic, but andoon lang yung fountain." said JR.

"Oh well lets go-" said Mijo before getting cut off.

Two people appeared, they looked like two people who Mijo seen before with Lauvielle on occasion.

"Great, more people." said Mijo.

"Lets just close the fountain and uh, forgot this happened." said Urda.

"Wait, yo, why does our phones not work?" said Reeb.

"Yeah, no cell towers here." said Mijo.

Then they went to the fountain and as they were about to close it,

"Hey, Reeb, what's your magic?" questioned Urda.

"Uh, let's see-" said Reeb, opening up a menu that looks like... Micnaft?!

"Oh cool, can you make a- wait Mijo!" said Urda.

"What? I'm closing it, oh yeah, the powers? sure, let's see it, Reeb!" said Mijo.

"OK, wash, isn't this op?!" said Reeb, placing diamonds down.

"Yeah, but i bet it will be like super costly or very strong but only on certain worlds, i know it all, well not all, but enough." said JR.

Then the two immediately met with the rest of the group.

"Hello, fellow people, you know how to get out of here?" said the girl.

"Hmm, wait isn't this what Lauvielle was saying about, like dark worlds or somethin!" said the boy.

"Oh yeah, and the fountain, so i'am guessing you guys know who Lauvielle is?" said the girl.

"Yeah, we, well most of us know who Lauvielle is. By the way, you guys know what your powers are?" said Mijo.

"Uh, we do?! Lets see," said the girl before opening with a larger gun and a bayonet.

The boy also tried, getting a simple handgun.

"Oh cool, i don't know that!" said the girl.

"Hey guys, we should get going." said JR.

"Ok, then." said Mijo.

So the fountain is closing and then they all wake up, 5 PM. Damn it, they were way past over the afternoon class.

"Damn, well lucky chance, let's go home." said Mijo.

"Ay, well let's go." said Urda.

"Ok, everyone here, uh, don't talk, don't reveal, basically just don't talk about what happenned here. Ok? Ok. I'm, we are not helping you out if you do." said Mijo.

"Got it, no words coming out of this girl!" said Reeb.
 
"Uh sure!" said the girl before getting out of the room.

"Yeah, ok!" said the boy before also going out.

"Oh, I gotta go, see ya' Mijo, Urda, and Reebs!" said JR.

"Yeah, I'am going too! See ya Urda and Mijo!" said Reeb before also going out.

"Uh, i gotta go. I'll be seeing you, soon?" said Urda.

"Yeah, bye!" said Mijo.

SO they both went home, and not together, as Urda went out first. Mijo went last, making sure things were in order.

Author's Note: So, there ya go, but i really want to keep this going, but the fact that I'am not done with season 1 is kinda stressful and with school, oh man.. Anyways this one's
short, because this is the first time i wrote on a notebook instead of a phone's notes app. Hopefully i can have bigger one's in the future. Adios!

<p id="C2"><md-block># C2 DeltaRambles: Mountain of Thought</md-block></p>
<md-block>

Summary: Starts off with a school story, ends with a dark world adventure. Like the old times right?
    
Mijo starts out, looking out of a balcony, near the classroom, as the Wednesday cleaners clean inside.
 
He wonders to himself, the past few weeks, he made a new friends, reconnected with old ones, and he's set with a potential research title approved. But all through it he still remembers
the dark world, even though a mishap happened during the first days of school, things slowed down and people focused on their schoolwork.
    
"Ah man, i wish i could do more but i've been busy and sick, all my friends are, well, busy too, I just wish that i had a chance, waitm can't I make my own dark worlds? I've been
inactive for this long!" as Mijo rants to himself, the Wednesday cleaners finish.
    
He decides to go down, because as he was ramblling to himself, the cleaners finished and went home.
    
The next day in school, he decides to think about it a little bit more, near his previous spot.

"Ok, so where exactly? Maybe the 9-Lit room? Like, where everybody is? But, I dont know what will happen, it could be bad, hmmm, maybe i could try during uwian, kasi it replicates the 
same situation as before and less people can ruin the secret, ok, thats-" Mijo got cut off by a new friend of him called Ikari.
    
"Dude, what have you been thinking of in the past hour? YOu just stood there and... What?" questioned Ikari.
    
"I have been thinking of plans, ok?" responded Mijo.

"Plans of what? World Domination?" said Ikari.
    
"No- something else secret, ok? Wait, actually, can you stay for a bit after dismissal?" said Mijo.
    
"Why- Oooh- You want me to help you in our AP Project? Well, the answer's no." said Ikari.
    
"Please? Para meron ka namang ambag-" said Mijo.
    
"Oo na nga, sige, sige." said Ikari.
    
Then JR suddenly appeared shouting "Papunta na si Ma'am!" they all quickly wbet inside the classroom.

After two classes, it was time for class dismissal, Mijo, Ikari and a bunch of groupmates all actually did the group project but as more people went out of the classroom and went home.
Mijo decided it was time.

"Ok guys, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the classroom and-" said Mijo.
    
"Oh yeah, I also will be doing that, come on, Mijo." said Ikari.

"Ok, then cool." said Mijo.

So, off they go towards the classroom of 9-Lit. They eventually made it with little conversation as they both ran to the classroom. Ikari was first though, Mijo was second.
    
"Hah- uou're second." said Ikari.
    
"Yeah, yeah, ok. Wait." said Mijo.

Then Mijo went to the middle of the classroom, got a ballpoint pen and stabbed the floor, filling the room with darkness.
    
"Yo, bro, what you doin' you just stabbed the floor and like dark air starts coming out?" said Ikari.
    
"Yeah, pretty much, now... wh- get prepared for the floor to dissapear." said Mijo.
    
"WHAT!? Bro, I'am getting the hell out of here, won't you too?" said Ikari.

"Its too late, the floor, is already collapsing..." said Mijo.
    
"Bro-" said Ikari before quickly hrabbing Mijo and quickly getting out of the classroom, but the floor already collapsed. Before both of them fell, they saw a dark sky with no sun or \
moon. Only black.
    
*Darkness Returns*

Ikari woke up in a dark place, only a platform and connecting ones filled the empty world.

"Ugh, that fucker, really put us in this dark- wait, isn't this like, what happened during the first days and accounts from Lauvielle? Shoot, I'am in a dark world." said Ikari.

"Well, dapat naman siguro, merong daanan dito, ay- yung mga weapons ko!" said Ikari.

Ikari managed to grab her full rifle with detachable sword in the bottom of the gun.

"Oh, maganda yan, full gun with a free sword." said Ikari, before moving throughout the floating platforms.

"I mean, dapat naman makita ko siya, kasi, at least sabi ni Lauvielle, naglalakad lang daw siya at nakikita na niya ang kaklase niya..." said Ikari.

After going through endless quizzes about school rules about drinking, smoking, bullying and more. She discovered a 2-story building with 5 rooms in each floor. A hallway allowed her to
navigate each room.

"Well, I have no choice, is either that, or through those stupid quizzes again. Ok, I can do this..." said Ikari before entering the building and opening the door of the nearest room 
closest to her.

"Hello, anyone there?" said Ikari, to no one in an empty, but organized room.

She moved on to the next one, and the next, no one was there. It looked like she entered after everybody went home. She went upstairs and checked all the rooms to the left of her, no 
one. She checked the nearest right one, no one, but when she checked the next one...

"Ugh, everybody there?" said Ikari, tired.

"Yeah, that's me..." said Mijo, also tired.

"Woah, what the fuck dude, i almost had a fuckin panic attack hearin' your ass..." said Ikari, surprised.

"You're lucky, by the way, when i landed here, there were a bunch of enemies, like really tough ones, like bottlemen, bullet-hell people, a lot of that type." said Mijo, while looking 
straight towards Ikari.

"Yeah, yeah... Hey, how did you open this... world, anyway, I though we were about to fuckin' die!" said Ikari.

"Look, If you heard it from Lauvielle, that means I have been here, before. However, it seems that I have been severely weakened by this world, so first time fighting for real." said 
Mijo.

"Ok... That was a lot of yapping, but ok, so you know how this world works? Cool, get me out of here, I wanna go home." said Ikari.

"No- like i know how they work, but this specific world? Only now, so you're gonna have to follow me." said Mijo.

"Hey! Well, I guess? I kinda wanna go off on my own." said Ikari.

"Well, if that's what you want, i also wanna explore and alone for the first time, too!" said Mijo.

"Ok, i guess I'll go to that city over there, have fun!" said Ikari, looking out of a window.

"Yep- you too." said Mijo.

So both went their separate ways, but-

"Hey, wait- how do we go there?" said Ikari.

"Brute Force." said Mijo, before slicing the wall in half and pushing it into the rubble below.

"Oh, ok. " said Ikari before going out the same hole, but going towards a different part of the city.

It was vast and overwhelming for Ikarim for even videogames can't prepare you for real, seeing a bunch of humanoid and monster-like beings walking around, though she would meet a
familiar, yet strange person.

"Hey! You're a... I mean- Are you with Mijo?" asked Jomi.

"Uh, used to, if you're lookin' for him, he's somewhere in the city, i dont know ehere but somewhere... to the right of me." said Ikari.

"Oh. jeez, ok. Uh so have you, like have you had magic-" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah, I alreay have them, the gun and- wait- who are you anyway? You seem to know Mijo, and you-" said Ikari.

"I look like him, i know, know. I'am Jomi, the princess of the dark. I... met him, with his friends, before." said Jomi.

"Oh, like, are you part of this world or are you with us?" said Ikari.

"I guess you can call me a part of this world, I'am a princess of dark after all." said Jomi.

"Nice, do you have an empire or a kingdom... or even a castle?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, I have a castle, unfortunately, you haven't seen my largest one in... another world, but I have one here, for some reason." said Jomi.

"But, wait? I thought you lived here? Why would you have one somewhere else? Do you own multiple castles?" said Ikari.

"Yeah? Technically now, well, we should get going, we need to find him first, though, I can't let anyone stay here as the fountain closes." said Jomi.

"Ok, sure, got nothing i can do anyway, hey- are there any cell-" said Ikari.

"Cell service, none. You hear that? Sounds like music..." said Jomi.

"Should be a disco around here, oh hi. Jomi." said Mijo.

"Oh my- finally," Jomi runs up to Mijo and said "I have been looking for you in, hours!" said Jomi.

"Yeah, yeah- You're gonna serrmoon me about how irresponsible at mapanganib ang ginawa mo' at papauwi mo kami?" said Mijo.

"Well, yes. But like, don''t you wanna go home?" said Jomi.

Silence. Then Mijo said "No, NO! I... realized that through all of it, I enjoyed being a herom or just bonding with friends. School life's monotonous and boring." said Mijo.

"Ay, me too. But how do we get out of here? My dad's gonna be pissed..." said Ikari.

"Yeah, uh you have to help her, its like kind bad to trap her here. just go, we have to discuss this matter later." said Jomi.

"Ugh, fine. Only her, though. I wanna stay here." said Mijo.

"No- Mijo you don't understand"

<md-block>
Summary: After the school announced the second intramurals in a year, Mijo and his friends came up with a new way of using sports through the dark world's magic...

Author's Note: Not sure yet, where to put this but it's definitely late game. Also just a little bit inspired by real life events, just a little.

An alarm is ringing as Mijo realizes that he's almost definitely gonna be late...

"Shi- not again..." said Mijo as he quickly tried to rush his morning school routine.

He tried to, but in the end, he was late by a couple of minutes, as he heard the flag raising ceremony happen, he knew he was late but had to go somewhere. After moving through the hallway and towards the stairway leading up to his classroom, he puts his bags at his seat then quickly dashes to the computer laboratory next to his classroom. As it was unused, this had been where they set up the dark world.

"Ok, I'm here, let's see if it's open." said Mijo as he looked inside the glass door.

"Yep, ok let's go." said Mijo as he jumped in and  landed in a cyber city, full of computers and there he met Jomi.

"Hi! Jomi, i was a little bit late, sorry!" said Mijo.

"I.. expected that, but still.. you _should_ have gone here a bit earlier like 6:30?" said Jomi.

"Right, sorry again, you know.. parents, and me not sleeping-" said Mijo.

"-at the right time, yes, you should have known to not sleep at 3, isn't that right?" said Mijo.

"Ye- Yeah... Look, i want to discuss with you, the plan i was saying last week.." said Mijo.

"Oh? Ok. What is it, you also said you were bringing your friends..." said Jomi.

"Oh! They must be finishing up, i might need them, i will come back very soon, wait here, ok?" said Mijo.

"Fine. But seriously plan everything, if you keep getting overwhelmed like this..." said Jomi.

"Yeah.. yeah.." said Mijo as he went back to the light world.

"Ah ok, so it should be- ah crap, I am probably absent because of the whole protection of the dark thing, so uh.. Hmm what are they doing there anyway..." said Mijo.

"So any more announcements? No? Well you all can go back to your classrooms now!" said the person at the stage with a mic.

"Oh no, if they see me... They would have known I didn't attend.. shit! Uh uh, aha! I just have to.. message them at the gc... Right, how could i forget about that, anyways.." said Mijo as he opens his phone and types:

Mijo: @everyone, so uh i am not absent, i just didn't attend the FRC, but the reason is we have a group meeting in the dark world. Anyone available can join, thank you all!!!

"Ok that should, be good. Now it's time to explain to Jomi why they aren't here yet." said Mijo.

Mijo jumps in again then meets Jomi.

"Hey..." said Mijo.

"And where's your friends, hmm?" said Jomi.

"Uhh, they're on their way... Hopefully." said Mijo.

"Hopefully? Sure. But have you actually formulated anything about any plan regarding.. whatever you're thinking about, or you came here to ask me..?" said Jomi.

"Ehe~ yep. I.. I have a plan, just an incomplete one..." said Mijo.

"Oh? Then what is it?" said Jomi.

"Ok, so i got the idea when, they announced the intramurals for this week, and I wanted to replicate that but in the dark world, but I don't know where to start, as there are a lot of factors that i think you can only answer." said Mijo.

"Interesting. What about your friends, besides being the competitors, i assume..?" said Jomi.

"Oh yeah, exactly what you're thinking. Some of them competitors, some facilitators, they choose." said Mijo.

"Hmm, how many? You know i have to make room, food, utilities, and other materials for the sports and.. that takes time." said Jomi.

"Hmm, right now, about only 60 people know of a dark world and have been in one, and most of them are my friends. So that? Though, i want more." said Mijo.

"Well, how many? I think we can still fit those.. 'guaranteed' people, even with extra stuff." said Jomi.

"Hehe, now that's a problem because... I don't know how many, because i want to ask-" said Mijo.

Then suddenly behind them, a bunch of people appeared; JR, Lauvielle, and Ikari.

"He- Hey, Mijo! I.. just came here and.. what is it you wanted to meet about.." said JR, exhausted.

"Yeah, i had to catch up, as _JR_ was running..." said Lauvielle.

"Oh yeah, don't forget about me! I had to run as well!" said Ikari.

"I.. probably shouldn't have rushed you guys, but-" said Mijo.

"It's about the intramurals, i take it you all would have heard about it?" said Jomi

"Yeah, but why? What did you want to ask that relates here?" questioned Ikari.

"So, I want to make the intramurals but here, in the dark world." said Mijo.

"Huh? Now, uh you got a plan for that, Mijo?" said Ikari.

"Hehe, now... That's why y'all are here..." said Mijo.

"Now, that idea looks fun! Mijo, but uh we need a break... Some of them also should arrive like... Leviente... Or Rhida? I don't know dude..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh can we go to your CPU castle, Jomi?" said JR.

"Sure. We'll continue it there, I have some tables and chairs set up already. You all go ahead without us, I have a word to speak to Mijo..." said Jomi.

"Ok!" said Lauvielle, Ikari, and RJ as they head to the castle, walking.

"Ok now you, Mijo, 'Plan'?" said Jomi.

"Uh what do-" said Mijo.

"I said a word to you, now i will speak words instead." said Jomi.

"Jomi!? Let's get serious, please?" said Mijo.

"Yeah yeah, so about that participants thing, how?" said Jomi.

"I.. will find a way." said Mijo.

"Don't tell me you are making a dark world in the gymnasium!" said Jomi.

"Well, that was one, but-" said Mijo.

"But? You know there's a reason why you made it a whole secret and there's magic involved-" said Jomi as they pass the castle's gates.

 "Yeah, yeah, that's stupid. But, what room can i even use, it's not like i can keep making it here, in cyber city. I have to find a perfect spot, somewhere around the school..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, now I don't know, but you'll have to see for yourself. Anyways, we're here." said Jomi.

"Wow, you- you changed a lot in the castle ever since making this my main dark world...." said Mijo.

"Yeah, yeah. Though i have noticed the amount of darkners that are 'visitors' from another land have increased..." said Jomi.

"Hmm, is it anything to do with the increase of students in the computer lab?" said Mijo.

"Probably, I don't mind it, they're usually fine people. I was just curious. Anyways we should head inside." said Jomi.

"A'ight.." said Mijo.

They headed inside to see the others talking at the table.

"I always wondered why it was so fast to go from there to here..." said Mijo.

"Magic, well- more like my castle is just really close to the destination." said Jomi.

"Wait, then like, how do you respond to the visitors?" said Mijo.

"Oh, well.. notice how we passed by the gate while we're talking?" said Jomi.

"There was a gate..? Sorry, Jomi, i just tend to miss some things..." said Mijo.

"I noticed. Anyway, that's closed when I order it to be closed so the visitors would have to go around to the city first." said Jomi.

"Oh ok.. uh hey let's greet them!" said Mijo.

"Hi! Mijo! We were just talking about random stuff." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, like how Lauvielle keeps yapping about Leviente's neck pillow..." said Ikari.

"Hey! I- It's important!" said Lauvielle, a bit flustered.

"So what did you want to talk about Mijo?" said JR.

"Uh, so about here, it's something to do with the intramurals." said Mijo.

"Like the one announced earlier and in the gc?" said Ikari.

"Yeah, like that but here, with magic and cool shit." said Mijo.

"Ah, ok. Uhm, so how?" said JR.

"Hehe, now that's the thing, I don't know!!" said Mijo.

"Ugh..." said Jomi as she facepalms. "We have already discussed some parts, he said he wants you guys to be either facilitators or players." said Jomi again.

"Can it be both?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, Mijo! Answer the question." said Jomi.

"Uh, yeah! As long as someone else is also facilitating." said Mijo.

"So, we have two per.. game. Hmmph, we need more people." said Jomi.

"Hmm, can we ask our other classmates? From our section?" said JR.

"Yeah! I'm planning on accommodating a lot of people. Hmm how many are in the dark world gc?" said Mijo.

"Uh, I don't remember, and we can't check it here..." said Ikari.

"Oh no... Well we have to go back but we might get spotted..." said Mijo.

"Hmm, aren't the grade 7's finally using this room, Mijo?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Right. Um, wait, when do they go here?" Said Mijo.

"Uh, we should go right now, because they can arrive anytime and discover this.. and I do not trust those *children*." said JR.

"But- ugh, fine. Let's go, we can talk about this after school. Y'all have like, delayed pick up driver?" said Mijo.

"I do, but i know that JR usually goes early and it's Monday so..." said Lauvielle.

"Yeah, uh- i was gonna say in the gc, but we haven't even informed the rest of them that we have a plan now.." said JR.

"Yep, um, i guess we'll be here uh.. Mijo! You inform JR of our agreements later ok?" said Ikari.

"Got it, let's just—" said Mijo.

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of monsters from the abyss start pounding on the castle's gates. It can be heard all the way to the inside of the castle.

"Ugh, abyss monsters. I don't know why or how they're here but they have raised their activity a lot these past few weeks." said Jomi.

"Well, uh we'll see then hehe, we have to go back so let's kill those monsters!" said Mijo.

"Yeah!" said everybody else.

So all of them headed out of the castle and Jomi decided to open the gates, by saying "Open the gates! Execution Mode!" as some darkners came to fight the monsters.

"What is it, your highness?" said a darkner.

"Kill these abyss monsters, right now." said Jomi.

"Yes, your highness, we shall." said a darkner as they charged into battle.

"Damn, you got an entire army and you're a leader? You have a lot of subjects now." said Mijo.

"Yep, you better go, don't waste our manpower here." said Jomi.

"Ok guys, let's go!" said Mijo before his group attacked the monsters left and right. The group moved through waves of abyss attack, for some reason, more than they had anticipated but they arrived at the light tunnel.

"Ok, that was a bit much. Where did they all come from???" said Ikari.

"The abyss, duh." said Lauvielle.

"Hey—" said Ikari.

"Wait, yeah but more and more the monsters are increasing in their attacks... There might be a catalyst outsider. Just, watch out, all of you." said Jomi.

"Ok, well guys let's-" said Mijo as the others went up.

"Rude. Anyways, bye Jomi! See you later!" said Mijo as he went up.

"Something might happen during the next few days, but I am not sure what it is, before they arrive, I must investigate myself." said Jomi as she goes back into battle.

"Hey guys!" said Mijo as he meets his friends, waiting for him.

"You're here, let's go. It's lunch so we have our school time cut in half." said JR.

"That's nice, well let's eat," said Mijo as he looked to his back, seeing the normal computer lab.

"Yep, let's go." said JR as all of them went their separate ways of eating lunch.

"Anyways, the amount of monsters is interesting, to say the least. But I have to eat so let's think about that later." whispered Mijo to himself as he went and got his food.

"Oh nice, dry chicken with rice and cut hotdog. Hmm, you know, if i only didn't prioritize eating as fast as possible i would have disliked this and the variety too. Anyways, I am just gonna eat now." said Mijo to himself as he looks at this food as he prepares it.

He eats food and after a while, he finishes and pulls out his diary that he doesn't call a diary.

"Alright, so abyss monsters, hmm what type though... Ooh! I saw one that has scythes, what else...  Hmm, i saw one that was just a big guy with an axe... Ok, ano pa ba... Aha! I know! It looks like a two legged beast that has arms that shoot fireballs, or i think it was just rockets... Well, that should be some of the enemies i encountered there.." said Mijo again, to himself as he writes it all down on his diary / notebook / whatever he calls it.

"Hey, Mijo, whatcha doing there.." said Ikari.

"Oh just, writing. Um... why?" said Mijo.

"Oh, nothing. Just bored. Anywho, i know you didn't attend the morning classes, that's why i got us a *Reviewer*." said Ikari.

"You want us, to review? I mean, if there were
 quizzes we could just—" said Mijo.

Then outside the classroom, a bunch of grade 7's are approaching the computer lab in a line, and all slowly go inside.

"—go into the dark world..." said Mijo as he realized something.

"Yeah, no, it's not an option anymore... Well, you said you could make dark worlds, soo why not here..?" said Ikari.

"Hmm, that's a last resort, also, I.. just don't want more people knowing about it..." said Mijo.

"Ok, well we better review or you might have to forego your secret haha.." said Ikari.

"Hehe, yeah. Let's do it." said Mijo as he put away his 'notebook'.

As they reviewed, eventually time passes and it's time for class. First they had a quiz, and then another quiz. After that, the class was dismissed.

"Goodbye, mam Sant!" said everyone as the teacher left the classroom.

"Ok, Mijo this is our opportunity, see ya on the flip side!" said Ikari as she quickly rushed through the barely functioning classroom door and to the computer lab.

"Wait!" shouted Mijo then said to himself; "Hmm, when i went out, the dark world was gone so if she—"

"Hey, Mijo! Come here!" shouted Ikari as she stands near the door looking at him.

"Yeah! Coming!" shouted Mijo back as he also went out of the barely functioning door to Ikari.

"When are we gonna fix that... Anywho, let me guess—" said Mijo.

"The dark world's gone!" said Ikari, with a worried expression.

"That, um, so— like, the dark world's not gone, but we have to do something to make it appear again." said Mijo.

"Really? But, it's closed... It's locked." said Ikari.

"Wha— oh that makes sense. But, we could just break inside?" said Mijo.

"Sure... But how..?" said Ikari.

*Lauvielle joined the conversation*

"Hey guys, I thought we were going to the dark world, what are you guys still here for?" questioned Lauvielle.

"Um, the dark world's gone..." said Mijo.

"WHAT?! How are we supposed to go in then?" said Lauvielle.

"I don't know!! That's why I'm asking him!" said Ikari.

"Hey, I got this, ok? Just, we need to gain access to the room..." said Mijo.

"How..? That's why we're tryna have a discussion, because—" said Ikari.

"—we don't have any way. Yeah. I know." said Mijo as he looks and sees Sir Joriec and his key to the computer lab. "I think we have an opportunity though..." said Mijo.

"Si sir Joriec?!" said Lauvielle, surprised about seeing Sir Joriec.

"Hi, Lauvielle, Cala, nice to meet you again. We're here just to clean up the computer lab." said Sir Joriec as he goes to the computer lab and unlocks it.

"Hey, Mijo, this is our chance... Let's go right now!!" said Ikari to Mijo secretly.

"Hold on, do we include them? Because, you know..." said Mijo back.

"Hey!! What are you guys talking about, i got... distracted..." said Lauvielle, clearly still shocked by the appearance of the teacher.

"Oh, umm, let's go to the dark world now, Mijo! Use your 'magic method', hehe." said Ikari, with  a sarcastic tone.

"Alright, hold on, they should be—" Mijo said, before getting interrupted by a voice nearby.

"Hey! Is sir Joriec there? Mam Sant is asking me to call him..." said Isatac.

"Yeah," said Lauvielle as she looked into the computer lab and said to Sir Joriec, "Hello po, you are being called by Mam Sant..."

"Ay, Sure. I'll go outside right away!" expressed Sir as he went outside and went with the student to go talk to Mam Sant.

"Good, that's our opportunity! Let's go inside then, Mijo, you will create the dark world." said Ikari before she went inside the room.

"Hey! Wait up!" shouted Mijo, as he tried to grab Ikari by the shoulder making her stop by the door. "I don't think creating a dark world with this many people, is a great idea." he continued.

"Oh, now _you_ don't want more people finding out, how are we supposed to invite people then?!" argued Ikari, as she angrily got in.

"Guys, Sir Joriec is coming back here! We need to go there right now. I can talk our way out of this, just make the world already!" said Lauvielle to both of them as she went outside and looked for potential witnesses.

But then suddenly a huge explosion was heard, and a bunch of other smaller ones as well, it was heard around the school.

"What is happening?!" said Ikari, panicking over the supposed destruction going on.

"Uh oh, we need to go in right now! Jomi might need our help!" said Jomi, reassuring Ikari, as he prepared to stab the ground.

"Mijo!! The world's collapsing, again! So many fountains..." shouted Lauvielle from the door as  she looked towards the balcony.

"Alright, let's beat some abyss monsters." said Mijo as he stabbed the ground and recreated the dark world. 

Suddenly, a blinding white light started to blind the three of them and since the door wasn't closed, it connected with the other worlds which were made with connecting them all in mind. Mijo woke up near the place where Jomi usually meets him, but he saw a battlefield instead.

"Ay putakte, there's so many monsters... I thought Jomi got it..." said Mijo as he looked upon the razed grounds of Jomi's Castle.

Then Jomi appeared, knocking back abyss monsters with her signature pink lightning cut, then slashing a big monster through the middle, then quickly dashing to Mijo.

"Hey, you have come at the worst time! The abyss just started a massive attack and I have been trying to suppress them here, what's the situation at the light?" said Jomi as she attacked a bunch of abyss monsters going towards her and Mijo.

"It's bad!! Its super duper bad!!" said Ikari, only just waking up.

"Woah! didn't notice you there. Yeah, I think a bunch of dark worlds also opened..." answered Mijo, shocked at Ikari as he didn't notice her.

"What?! Hold on, really?" said Jomi, shocked at Mijo's answer.

"Yeah, we got here because of that, and uh we were supposed to be here for the—" said Mijo before being interrupted by Jomi. "Yeah, yeah, the intramurals... Let's deal with these monsters first, ok? Also, i thought Lauvielle was supposed to be here..."

"She technically didn't enter, and since the outside was also being filled..." Mijo thinks, then says, "She must be around here, since she wasn't where we were, oh yeah, my entire school probably is here..."

"Oh no, I fear that they have executed their plan very well, we need to stop them." said Jomi, thinking about her investigation earlier.

"Well, then let's goo!! We have to find other people anyway..." said Ikari, worried about her friend's wellbeing.

"I.. have to go stop them, you all look for your lightner friends, me and my army will march straight to
