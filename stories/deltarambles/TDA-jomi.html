Jomi - In-Canon VA

The records indicate when these were recorded and what chapter / season they appeared. This resets every season.

There are edits whenever something important happens and the chapter where it took place is indicated.

She records these archives and stores them in her library of recollection, she assumes that she doesn't know who she's speaking to.

## Introduction - Characters

## Mijo - C1S1

Him? Ah yes, the main character of this world... Hmm, well at least here in the dark world.

He certainly is interesting... He possesses the power of the light but.. he uses it to have fun with his friends. Can't blame him, honestly.

As for his character, he is dedicated to his work, just in unusual ways... He can be a bit forgetful, always procrastinating but when there's a situation that requires willpower, you best believe he'll be there, and fighting.

He has a special thing when it comes to his so-called 'romantic' relationships, he's just not good at it, like.. I see Urda, and Rhida and yet, uh he doesn't seem to notice, I have to point it out to him...

He wields his sword, called the 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' with main resonance being electro. Honestly, this guy could choose anything but chooses to be unoriginal, anyways— he often doesn't stick to one weapon as he switches his fighting style very often. So when he's wielding a bow, best believe that he's guaranteed to miss.

He is currently studying at Honrato Pez, one of the most prestigious schools of science in his city. Although nowadays, he often focuses on his work in the dark world... He does this as a way of escaping school and still learning... But that's just what he says.

Anyways, that's all I can say about him for now, maybe in a year, we'll see...

### C3S1

I.. don't have much to say, he.. well, a few things, one.. I'm not sure for now, but he got.. along and even started to chat with Rhida.. Two, he's growing more confident, but I feel that his stress is getting higher.. I don't know. I should talk if I get the chance to.


## Urda - C1S1

Ah! Her? She is... a peculiar individual... As she's connected with the prophecy like Mijo but.. she doesn't care unlike him.

She is a fighter at heart, and is laid back so she is a great friend to be with. Although, she is also an introvert, and that's why she has few friends. But, she doesn't care.

Her best friends currently are Jamise and Mijo, though she often has mixed feelings about the latter, sometimes thinking about romantic love but otherwise still good friends, she often comes to me and Jamise, but Jamise tends to be type to be straightforward... So that's why I am here...

The great thing about her is her creativity, she often has ideas for everything, she likes to draw, sing and dance— but keeps that to herself and her closest friends.

She wields a pistol and a sword, the sword is named 'Sutādasutokuruseidā', and a pistol named, 'Ōgon no Kaze'. with her anemo resonance. She started the whole 'naming your weapons japanese' since she did it first, her friends started copying her. 

She is also currently studying at Honrato Pez, one of the most prestigious schools of science in her city. Though, she doesn't really like science, after the dark world, she decided to stay for the near future, developing her artistic skills while possible.

Anyways, that's what I can say about her, maybe she will change in a year, who knows?

## Jomi - C1S1

Me? You want to learn about me? I am of course, the princess of the dark but—  I don't know about the others, but I describe myself as a sensible woman, with practical skills and intelligence.

Hmm, from what I hear, they say I am 'weird' and look like Mijo but I— agree... I often compare myself to Mijo, so I can say that's true and still be better than them, so take that! Haha, just joking...

I often become the therapist for some reason, first, Rhida, then Urda, then Mijo, like... Don't you all have parents and siblings? Like I know I am your good friend and all, but I am not licensed, though, for some reason, it helps them, I don't know.. but I guess that's just my effect.

I wield a sword named 'Fire Sword' and I resonate with fire. They told me to change it and I say, wait until I get a good one. The current one i have is the 'Burning Dark Sword'. 

I am the princess of this dark world and I shall guide the dark and the light together. We'll see in a year, if i succeed.

## JR - C2S1

JR, he is a.. hard-working guy i guess. I heard that he is often straight with people in terms of what he feels. He is great friends with Mijo and Rhida.

He usually jokes around with dark topics like death, stress and arson. At least, from what I have seen. He tends to be a smart and resourceful guy, always finding and refining stuff he finds turning them into great artifacts.

He wields a magical staff named 'Medical Start' and a sword with a snake named 'Snake Storm'. He resonates with a mix of electro and geo energy. He loves his names and refuses to follow the others in naming their weapons in Japanese.

He studies at Honrato Pez, a prestigious school of science in the city. He wanted to be a cardiologist and still wants to be, but now he is trying to master magic, and eventually fighting.

 That is all I can say about him, hopefully he succeeds in that goal, but we'll see.

## Jamise - C2S1

Her? Uh.. Well she is a very... very extroverted person... She is often at odds with the others due to her peculiar perspective on things, she is friends with Urda and.. pretty much her only.

She is a headstrong person, with a sense of leadership since she is the president of her class. She often conflicts with JR, Lauvielle, and Leviente, in class administration and in-general when they talk.

She wields a magical staff named 'Hātīsutikku' and she resonates with hydro. She has a good shield and often is aggressive with a touch of martial arts she often fails at, resulting in the healer healing her a lot. If she's in the team, the healer will know her by that point.

She studies at Honrato Pez, and has a leadership position there. She was a member of multiple clubs before deciding to focus on the dark world and helping others adjust to it.

That's what I can say about her, will she become a new hero, or will she be pulled into the abyss? Who knows, as right now, she seems good.

## Lauvielle - C3S1

Oh, she is a very talkative person and likes to befriend everyone. She currently has an open secret in which she has a boyfriend, and that is Leviente. I say open because even I could see their relationship without anyone telling me.

Aside from that, she often is very protective, and very self-aware. She often is and mostly talks with one person, Leviente. They met up and got together, one christmas evening. Ever since, they have been navigating and sorting through their love, having challenges.

She wields a book, titled "Love & War". That she got from some random part of *****'s library. She picked it up when the group was browsing the library and they decided to get it, the book enchanced her powers by being able to make bombs and energy swords. She named her main energy sword, "Mahō" and resonates with  electro and hydro, which is... huh? That's another, special lightner.. But, her energy sword, why is it so simple...

She studies at Honrato Pez, and is often doing everything she wants to do before going home, due to her overbearing parents. After the dark world, she often goes and talks to the people there for hours.

That's what I will say about her, hm, we'll see how she moves through the future.. Because her life is.. one of tragedy at worst, and a drama at best. We'll see...

## Leviente - C3S1

Haha, him? He's a friendly guy, but often stays to himself and his group, his peers. Although, on some days, some hours, you can see him talking to another student, Lauvielle.

When not dating Lauvielle, he usually stays with his bros, his compadres; Mijo, JR, and Mack. He started with Lauvielle during one Christmas night and the rest is history, he calls it. Though he often jokes around, he can be serious if it calls for it.

He wields a book titled, "Book of Englightenment". He got it at a ***** library, when he was browsing through science and history and found it, this enhanced his powers being able to make floating swords and wields a knight attire when defending, he named this form, "Geyersrotschwarzerrüstung" which he bunched up a bunch of german using Urda's naming technique as an inspiration.

He studies at Honrato Pez, is often very smart there and actually knows a bunch of math and science, he often uses this in the dark and light sometimes. He now frequents the dark world, visiting the library sometimes or going into the training ground to practice some moves.

That's what I will say about him, hmm I have a feeling his future will be complicated since he is currently feeling the pressure, and drama. We'll see.

## Rhida - C3S1

Oh? Her? Huh, she is a sociable person when it comes to it, but she often doesn't talk much. Though, she often gets the short end of the stick, she still powers through it, dedicated.

She's pretty smart and funny, she often talks with her friends a lot and is very outgoing to he friends. She often however outside of her friend group, doesn't talk much and leaves the talking to her friends. She can have good bonds, but she often can't.

She had crushed before, but not as confusing and now, more exhilarating. She tries to talk with Mijo subtly and is often the one trying the most. Hopefully she can learn to love again, but fate often is indifferent to love.

She has ice powers, and her main move is "Winter Storm" and the ice sword and mini ice swords she creates are all called the "Abisu no bein" that she got when she was protecting someone. She is pretty dangerous in this regard but she often restricts herself, seeing it as a responsibility she must uphold.

She studies at Honrato Pez, is smart there and is often part of the journalist club. She often uses her skills in the dark world with some successes and even made something that even I was impressed by. The "Fun-inator 3000" or what I call it which is less creative but gets the point straight, "Adventure Maker", currently only a design for a system that will reward people for just having fun in the dark world, it has commissions, a battle pass and other fun stuff.

Anyways, that's what I can say about her, who knows what might happen, will she and Mijo get together, a rough breakup? Will she be happy, we'll see...

## Mack - C3S1
Oh, him? I don't know much, 'cause soon after he left the dark world, I didn't see him much, Rhida told me that he often visits the plaza with Lauvielle sometimes.

But, from what I see, he's an.. eccentric guy I guess.. From what I can tell, he's somewhat.. what Mijo would call, 'flamboyant', I can't say much about him, since he rarely visits or I just don't see him much.. However, from what I see, he's energetic, dramatic, and expressive. At least, compared to JR and Mijo.

He uses a spear, called the, "Binoyari" and resonates with anemo. He's seen in this form, wearing a knight's armor with a red flower on his person, as he fights his enemies with honor.

He studies at Honrato Pez, and is a capable student there, he's often carefree in life, and visits the dark world sometimes to meet others with his friend group.

I really don't have much to say about this guy, just seems normal and likely plays a small part in the bigger picture.. Good luck, i guess.

## Fexili - C3S1

Oh, that guy, honestly.. He sticks to JR and Rhida mostly, so I hear things from him occasionally.. But not much. He usually is with JR or Rhida, so his activities depend on them.

Hmm, well.. He's fine.. I guess? I don't have anything to say about him, he pretty much disappeared from my view once that Dajovy world was done.. I don't know what happened to him, he didn't even get a cool powerup like Mack did.

He studies at Honrato Pez probably.. but I can't tell what he does or if he even goes to the dark world.. So, um.. I hope he's safe... hopefully.

## The Mountaineer - C3S1

An unknown lightner from across the light, created the neverending winter set that battled the harsh cold that took over his dark world. But after creating the **** machine, she disappeared from the dark, never to be seen again.

Huh, this person, I've never seen them before, I know of their presence ever since the skeleton king. I had always tried to meet them, but they somehow always avoided me.. I hope to see her, if she allows me to, anyway..


<p id="caj-rl"><md-block>## Caj Rala - C?S2</md-block></p>

She's from.. she doesn't know, but the first world she was in is Genshin Impact, and she just appeared in Monstadt and so took up writing as she seemed to have an affinity, but after an unexpected message from the Raiden Shogun, she arrives at the post-isolationist Inazuma with many stories in her mind, and somehow, begins to find her place as the best erotica writer in the world with the help of Yae Miko, and Raiden Ei.. 

She is an avid drinker of all drinks from dandelion wine to sake, and even dango milk once in Inazuma, she often gets drunk when she thinks she has free time. Awkward yet somehow good charisma and talent make her a desriable person to talk to.

Through her journey, she meets a wanderer (previously Scaramouche) that follows her around and eventually becomes hesitant friends with. He often returns from Sumeru to Inazuma just to meet her, and also keeps an eye on Raiden Ei, getting the attention of Nahida who begins to also follow his journey. She meets Caj, and realizes the reasons why Wanderer is there but she keeps the journey going, even going with Wanderer every time he goes to Inazuma. Though, he often tries to covertly run from Nahida to speak to Caj, but Nahida finds him soon anyway, and depending on the situation, she just observes.

As for Caj's other connections, she is acquainted with Kujou Sara due to her Raiden Ei connection, while Sara maintains a professional attitude in front of Caj, she secretly gets the writings that are loosely based on the Raiden Shogun by Caj and keeps that secret to herself while having an anonymous identity to speak to Caj like a fan. Ayaka and Yoimiya are both acquainted with Caj as well, Yoimiya keeps her friendly and cheerful demeanor and happily doing any fireworks requests related to Caj and her works. Ayaka is more pragmatic about Caj, and respects her, but is cautious about the more risque parts of Caj's works, this is also true for Ayato, but he hasn't met Caj personally, unlike Ayaka.

Caj has also met Kirara for frequent deliveries between her house, Yae Publishing House, Grand Shrine of Narukami, and the Tenshuku Palace for her writing reasons and Kirara has also read her works, but focuses on the more tame aspects. Caj has passed by Itto and Kuki Shinobi's group often, and while Itto knows about her and Shinobi as well, Caj hasn't spoken to them since the few times they've had an encounter, Caj was drunk. She hasn't met Kokomi and Gorou, but they are also acquainted with her, with Gorou sharing a more direct relationship through Yae Publishing House.

As for outside Inazuma, while in Monstadt, she is often seen with Venti, and has made acquaintance with Fischl, Mona and Bennett. The rest know her vaguely from the others, but are familiar with the drunk poet (Venti) and his new also drunk writer friend (Caj). She also has traveled to Liyue sometimes for Lantern Rite and met Xingqiu through there. The rest know her vaguely from the encounters while there, Zhongli, acquainted with her works often speaks to her when she's chilling at the tea place. The rest know her from her writings vaguely and as mentioned, Xingqiu and Zhongli.

Aside from those countries, by this point, her works have only just reached Fontaine, Natlan and Snezhnaya. So opinions on her haven't formed yet. This was made with the Traveler having just finished exploring Natlan, so future progression happens later.
