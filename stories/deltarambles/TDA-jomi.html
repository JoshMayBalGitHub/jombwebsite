Jomi - In-Canon VA
Introduction - Characters
The records indicate when these were recorded and what chapter / season they appeared. This resets every season.
She records these archives and stores them in her library of recollection, she assumes that she doesn't know who she's speaking to.

Mijo - S1C1

Him? Ah yes, the main character of this world... Hmm, well at least here in the dark world.

He certainly is interesting... He possesses the power of the light but.. he uses it to have fun with his friends. Can't blame him, honestly.

As for his character, he is dedicated to his work, just in unusual ways... He can be a bit forgetful, always procrastinating but when there's a situation that requires willpower, you best believe he'll be there, and fighting.

He wields his sword, called the 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' with his electro resonance. Honestly, this guy could choose anything but chooses to be unoriginal, anyways— he often doesn't stick to one weapon as he switches his fighting style very often. So when he's wielding a bow, best believe that he's guaranteed to miss.

He is currently studying at Honrato Pez, one of the most prestigious schools of science in his city. Although nowadays, he often focuses on his work in the dark world... He does this as a way of escaping school and still learning... But that's just what he says.

Anyways, that's all I can say about him for now, maybe in a year, we'll see...

Urda - S1C1

Ah! Her? She is... a peculiar individual... As she's connected with the prophecy like Mijo but.. she doesn't care unlike him.

She is a fighter at heart, and is laid back so she is a great friend to be with. Although, she is also an introvert, and that's why she has few friends. But, she doesn't care.

The great thing about her is her creativity, she often has ideas for everything, she likes to draw, sing and dance— but keeps that to herself and her closest friends.

She wields a pistol and a sword, the sword is named 'Sutādasutokuruseidā', and a pistol named, 'Ōgon no Kaze'. with her wind resonance. She started the whole 'naming your weapons japanese' since she did it first, her friends started copying her. 

She is also currently studying at Honrato Pez, one of the most prestigious schools of science in her city. Though, she doesn't really like science, after the dark world, she decided to stay for the near future, developing her artistic skills while possible.

Anyways, that's what I can say about her, maybe she will change in a year, who knows?

Jomi - S1C1

Me? You want to learn about me? I am of course, the princess of the dark but—  I don't know about the others, but I describe myself as a sensible woman, with practical skills and intelligence.

Hmm, from what I hear, they say I am 'weird' and look like Mijo but I— agree... I often compare myself to Mijo, so I can say that's true and still be better than them, so take that! Haha, just joking...

I wield a sword named 'Fire Sword' and I resonate with fire. They told me to change it and I say, wait until I get a good one. The current one i have is the 'Burning Dark Sword'. 

I am the princess of this dark world and I shall guide the dark and the light together. We'll see in a year, if i succeed.

JR - S1C2

JR, he is a.. hard-working guy i guess. I heard that he is often straight with people in terms of what he feels. He is great friends with Mijo and Rhida.

He usually jokes around with dark topics like death, stress and arson. At least, from what I have seen. He tends to be a smart and resourceful guy, always finding and refining stuff he finds turning them into great artifacts.

He wields a magical staff named 'Medical Start' and a sword with a snake named 'Snake Storm'. He resonates with a mix of electro and geo energy. He loves his names and refuses to follow the others in naming their weapons in Japanese.

He studies at Honrato Pez, a prestigious school of science in the city. He wanted to be a cardiologist and still wants to be, but now he is trying to master magic, and eventually fighting.

 That is all I can say about him, hopefully he succeeds in that goal, but we'll see.

Jamise - S1C2

Her? Uh.. Well she is a very... very extroverted person... She is often at odds with the others due to her peculiar perspective on things, she is friends with Urda and.. pretty much her only.

She is a headstrong person, with a sense of leadership since she is the president of her class. She often conflicts with JR, Lauvielle, and Leviente, in class administration and in-general when they talk.

She wields a magical staff named 'Hātīsutikku' and she resonates with water. She has a good shield and often is aggressive with a touch of martial arts she often fails at, resulting in the healer healing her a lot. If she's in the team, the healer will know her by that point.

She studies at Honrato Pez, and has a leadership position there. She was a member of multiple clubs before deciding to focus on the dark world and helping others adjust to it.

That's what I can say about her, will she become a new hero, or will she be pulled into the abyss? Who knows, as right now, she seems good.

Lauvielle - S1C3

Oh, she is a very talkative person and likes to befriend everyone. She currently has an open secret in which she has a boyfriend, and that is Leviente. I say open because even I could see their relationship without anyone telling me.

Aside from that, she often is very protective, and very self-aware.
