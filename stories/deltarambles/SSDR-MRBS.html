## 'Negative' Creep

## Author's Note:

Yep! There's a bonus scene even for this pair, don't worry.. I'm just testing if I can write scenes like this without ruining their lore, so good luck..! And as always **_SEXUAL CONTENT WARNING!!_**

"Hey.. Weird question, have you watched pron before?" She asks me, as I gasp and stumble on my words. "Any teen would have honestly, but there's a jarring lack of popularity for women centered ones..!" She continues, as I look at her and chuckle. "What...? Then you haven't looked far enough. Lesbian and Gay people fucking is somewhat a popular fandom in it." I responded, she widened her eyes and looked at me, with a faint smile. "How do you know huh?! Are you gay or something?" She asks, while keeping her hands in her chest.

"Nope. Still straight. But, I've been liking it more.. of the lesbian side of things, usually either intense or gentle.." I admit, as she blushes and looks away. "What..?! What..! That doesn't make sense..! You're straight, don't you like the usual dominating men fucking submissive women..?" She asks as I nod, "Well I do, but I've broadened my taste." I respond as she looks at me again, grabbing a pillow. 

"What.." She says, before sighing. "Forget about it. It was a mistake speaking to you about any.. sexual stuff. You look like a negative creep anyway." She says before looking away, as I respond, "You're the one who brought it up, Rika." I continued drawing a comic for a performance task that was so late now. "Shut up, Mizo. Continue your late drawing, be happy that ma''am doesn't reject late tasks." She says, as I chuckle.

"Like you're any better. That's the essay I helped you with, last week..! You're so late there that I'm considering helping you to give something to pass." I say, as she playfully slapped me. "Shush." She says, holding up a finger at my mouth as I nod, and continues my drawing.

After a while of silence, I went away to take a break in her bedroom, while I was spending my hours chilling with my phone, she went into the room and was a bit surprised. "W—what are you.. doing here..?" She asks, as I jump in surprise. "Oh..? I'm sorry, I didn't... uh.. just thought your room was much more comfier.." I say, as she faintly blushes a bit. She asks me, "W—why are you here anyway..? Are you procrastinating.. it's been like... an hour or so.." 

"Wait.. an hour..! Then I need to get back..!" I stand up and try to leave but she stops me. "Wait..!" She calls out, prompting me to look at her and ask, "Hmm? What?" She looked like she was about to say something before she pulled back. "N—nothing. Move on." She says, holding her own arm. "If you say so." I say, before moving, feeling a bit unsure of what she wanted to say.

I started drawing again, and I saw it in the corner of my eyes, she went out and started typing, without saying a word to me. After a while, I saw her come up to me. "Hey.. you done..?" She asked, and I answered, "No.. but are you..?" She shook her head and just sat back down, I didn't get to see what she was doing, but I didn't hear typing from her mechanical keyboard, and I didn't hear her phone play audio, so I only could assume she left the room or was staring off.

I took a break after the second page, and thought to myself, "Man that second page sucks ass to look at, but.. that's the limit of creativity.. I don't fuckin know why people expect magnum opuses due in 2 weeks, with 10 more tasks to do too." I then looked at Rika, she was just staring at her laptop screen, she probably wasn't reading it, considering the screen wasn't moving and her hands were on her lap, shaking.

"Hey... Rika..?" I call out, as she jumps up and looks at me, panting. "W—what?! I.. nothing. I was.. just.. AAAHHH!!" She responds, pushing me to the couch with a tight hug. "Hey?! What..! Rika..!" I protested, but I eventually put my hands around her back. "Mizo.. I don't want to be a student anymore.." She mumbles to me, while clearly holding back tears. "I don't want to exist..." She continued, getting more intense with her hug, as I felt her body heat up and shake.

"What.. I.. why..?" I ask, as she rolls me around the couch while I can feel her tears fall to my shirt. "I'm so tired.. Mizo.. but all I can do is worry about the next thing.. until the end of the school year.. and with that.. us.." She starts sobbing, as I gently pat her back while regrouping my thoughts. "Is this also about the research defense next week?" I ask, as I feel her tighten and flinch at my question. She tried to say something, but I couldn't understand her mumbles before she just stopped herself and was on the verge of bashing herself and me to the wall nearby.

"Please.. I don't know what I want.. anymore.. Do I want to be  husband and wife with.. you, or just really close best friends..? A—and.. will I get out of these.. cycles..? I don't want to hurt you, but I.. hurt so much.." She explains as she slightly releases from me but then hugs me again tightly before she continues. "God.. my parents barely understand me.. but every time.. I feel they've invalidated me.. or just.. don't.. leave me.. alone.. I shouldn't attach myself to you, but I can't help myself.. Please.. please.. I don't know why I'm saying it at this point.."

I try to process and listen to her, but I also start feeling more hazy, and I try to get her off, since I don't trust myself not accidentally getting a boner from this. "Mizo..?" Riza willingly lets me release from her but she was so shook up as she is looking at me while keeping her hands close to her chest. "Mizo.. why.." She stops herself, and nods, closing her eyes and going to her bedroom and locking it. I looked at her door, I don't know what she felt about it, but I didn't know if I should intervene, so I just sat down and tried to calm myself down.

But, my mind drifted off somewhere, I looked at my phone, and then I felt my boner slowly spring up, as my mind wanders to her very intimate hug. "No..! Stop.. it you horny Mizo.." I say to myself, but I know that I have to release it, least risking damaging Rika's trust in me with her bond. I keep my thoughts to myself as I head to the bathroom with my phone, ready to fulfill a sexual obligation I don't really desire, but feel so inclined to.

After I finished my obligation, I went out and saw Rika writing in her notebook. Her tears are still falling, but more reserved now. "Rika.." I say, as Rika looks at me and instantly tenses up. "M—mizo.." She says as she takes her notebook and moves away from the couch to the kitchen table. "Rika..! It's fine." I say, as she shakes her head intensely and struggles to keep writing. I hesitate to do anything, before sighing and sitting on the couch while I hear her occasional sob when writing.

"Damn it.. I can't believe I just.. did that because of her... I couldn't remove my mind from her.. body.. Not just.. not just how she touched me.. But.. my unwilling fantasies. I still remember vividly how many times she caught and almost caught me looking at very NSFW images.. and writing too, and I looked at her with a shameful lustful expression before I left hurriedly."  I thought to myself, as he can feel my boner rise again. "Shit.. no no.. stop.." I try to hide it with a pillow, unaware that Rika was staring at me that entire time.

She closes her notebook, then comes up to me and sits beside me. She looked at me, all depressed before letting herself drift off to sleep, with the notebook on the nearby table. I found myself drifting to look at her curves before pulling back, "Why am I feeling this about her..! I can't just let my best friend be objectified and sexualized like this.. When she trusts me with this.." I say to myself as she unconsciously falls, her head resting on the pillow on my lap.

"I'm.. just.. going to follow her to dreamland.. Hopefully she doesn't feel any morning wood later.." I say, before I also drift to sleep.

## Desired Object

## Author's Note:

I do not know how I got to this point, nor how I got the idea.. But, it's like.. a mix of the perverse desire to just use sexual desire as a coping mechanism and how I'd been experiencing sickness these past few weeks (yeah, while mine isn't that traumatic, if you read it, you can guess how I know how the processing of the whole thing.)

"Hey.. we.. need to be at school for the.. exam, I don't think you're studying.. so.. let's just eat already.." said Rika outside of Mizo's door, as Mizo was busy.. touching himself to various images of hentai. "Mizo..?" continued Rika as Mizo finished and headed to his bathroom to clean up before answering Rika. "Yeah? Yeah." said Mizo as his gaze clearly lingered over her form. Rika dragged him away before he could fully process what he was doing, with a faint blush. "Let's just eat brunch, this one. Hotdog and eggs, plus rice." said Rika as she sat down and started to eat, Mizo felt Rika was side-eyeing him.

After eating, Rika spoke up. "I'm done. You should clean them. I'm heading to the shower first." Rika then was about to go and stand up, when Mizo rushed to eat all of his food then ran to the sink first. "Nah. You do it." Mizo then ran to the shower, not before taking his towel. Rika sighed and rolled her eyes as she moved to clean their plates.

Mizo.. uh, he indulged in a bit more.. inappropriate activities inside the bathroom, and so when Rika was done and picked up her towel and headed to the bathroom, Mizo was still inside. "Mizo..? Come on.. we're technically not going to be late, but you're really stretching that leeway I gave to ourselves." said Rika, as she visibly heard the beating of.. meat? "Ugh. YOU'VE ALREADY.. Nevermind. Just.. go and be faster." Rika then heads to a mirror nearby to brush her hair as she waits for Mizo to be done.

Finally, Mizo was done as Rika went to the bathroom, and when she was done, she saw Mizo nowhere but she did hear noises from his bedroom. "Don't tell me.." Rika rushed and peeked over to Mizo's bedroom, he hadn't even closed the door as he.. indulged in self-pleasuring activities. Before Rika could burst in anger, she covered her mouth to shut up and left quickly. She went to her own bedroom to start drying and dress up but she couldn't get the image out of her head. "What the fuck is he thinking..? He hasn't reviewed the notes I gave him, he hasn't.. hasn't even joined me in that quick raid in the videogame! He's just.. been like that since the week started. Might need to speak to him after the exams.. Ugh.. why do people have to be so—" muttered Rika before she audibly gasped when she heard a knock.

"H—HEY?! What.. do you want?" asked Rika, as Mizo was clearly sarcastic in his tone, "Are you done yet? I've been waiting for a while.." Rika retorted, "OH SHUT THE FUCK UP! I'm getting there..! Maybe if you're faster at getting prepared because you're a **man**, maybe just maybe start reviewing?! Or literally do anything productive?!" Mizo laughed and responded, "Oh I'm doing something productive, I'm just waiting for you now." before leaving.

"Fuckin.. fucking... ahh!!!" screamed Rika as she held on to her pillows to calm herself down. "It's fine.. it's fine.. I.. damn it. Can't falter in the last three now.. The last three exams, after this.. I can.. okay. One more day.." Rika then fixed herself up and grabbed her bag as Mizo was already outside, her own snack bag being on the table. She grabbed and checked it, the usual stuff, tumbler with iced water and some snacks. "At least.. he hasn't failed with this one.." Rika sighed and headed out as she closed the house and headed to where Mijo was waiting.

Mijo smirked and then got them a tricycle driver to drive them to their school. Rika was silently there as Mizo smiled the whole way, then he paid for them before they went inside the campus. Mizo was speaking to his friends nearby, while Rika was silently reviewing on her phone.

After the exams, Rika was waiting outside on her phone when she was surprised by Mizo, too close to her personal space. She immediately pushed him back as her heart was pounding. "W—what was that for..? Look, I know you're dumb and all and took time on that English Exam, but.. unnecessary!!" said Rika as she looks at Mizo accusatory, while he smirks. Rika can feel Mizo looking at her lips without even focusing on it. "Just.. do you have anything else to do? I was waiting, 'cause you might have post-Exam fun, and I just wanted to know so I can plan ahead." said Rika, as Mizo looked around and kissed her on the lips quickly before whispering, "Of course, I am going out with the boys after this, I just.. wanted to see you~" and then leaving quickly.

"What..." said Rika as she looked at Mizo meeting up with his friends, somewhat far away with intense blushing. "You can't just.." Rika is barely holding her anger and shame from what happened as she looked away and to the balcony to process what just happened.

"Why..?" Rika asked herself as she held her head in her hands. She starts to feel dizzy and hazy, the touch intensifying her confusion. She quickly starts to dissociate what just happened, and calms herself down. She looked around and saw Mizo and his friends leave the school as she sighs and heads off as well.

She silently goes on to her routine, listening to her usual Nirvana playlist, while walking in the afternoon. She eventually arrives at a mall, and buys some ice cream with sprinkles that she immediately ate. She then moves to the local bookstore and inspects the books, mostly she has seen before, then some new generic books for the week, because of Valentine's day. She then moves out and walks alone to her house, where she goes inside and goes to her bedroom to rest.

"You're the reason I feel pain.. But.. it feels so good to feel again.." muttered Rika to herself, as tears fell without her own reaction, mechanically switching to her home clothes. Then out of the blue, Mizo burst into the room and pushed Rika to her bed, half-naked. She immediately widened her eyes and instinctively tried to avoid him but he managed to pin her down quickly.

"What?! PLEASE STOP! PLEASE!!" shouted Rika as she was trying to get out of Mizo's grip. "You're.. so.. fuckable right now.." said Mizo, drunk and slurred. "Ah?!! Get the fuck off mee!!" screamed Rika as she tried to push him away, but Mizo started to move to her sensitive areas. "Ah..? No.. can't falter.. stop.. please..!" said Rika, as she tried to get Mizo's hands off her, but her body started reacting, and she was dizzy again. "No.. don't.. please.. don't ruin.. please.. ah.. no.." Rika says before Mizo kissed her on the lips. She blacked out after this, she did not know what happened during this whole violation.

_Unknown amount of time later.._

"W—where am I?" asked Rika as she looked around her surroundings, it's morning. In school, she's in her uniform, it's that day of Valentine's but she doesn't remember what happened or how she got here. "What.. I.." Rika looks around, normal students doing normal student things. It looks like they're preparing for the events today involving a partnership between the spanish club and the student government to have a Spanish Valentine's day. 

She walks to her classroom, seeing the normal atmosphere, the usual chatter of people, and their relationships. As for Rika, she doesn't know how she is here, or what happened but she just decides to sit down and process what she has just remembered.

"Rika?" asked Kari, as she sat down next to her. "Uh.. you.. fine? It's just a perf. day, besides.. there's still next week yeah?" said Kari, as she looked at her. "A headache. I feel.. my head is hurting." said Rika, as she felt her head hurt intensely. "Oh? Then.. you should probably go home no? Maybe take a trike' home?" asked Kari as Rika looked at Kari. "I don't know how I got here.. And.. I can't think well.." Rika says before falling unconscious.

_Rika..? Rika...!!!_

"Huh?" asked Rika as she is being brought to the clinic in a wheelchair as she sees Kari and..   **_MIZO._**

"Mizo?! What happened?! Why is she at school?!"

"Ah, well I simply just didn't check on her that well after last night."

"What happened last night?!"

"We had fun."

"Fun? What fun?"

"Ohoho it's a secret.. But I'll let you guess, it's an s and an x in the end."

"Huh.. HUH?!! WAIT WAIT—"

"Rika!!!" shouted Kari as she shook Rika's body. "Are you.. fine? Well, no what I mean is.." Kari goes closer, "Are you pregnant?" she asks as Rika shrugged and shook her head. "Don't know.. what you mean?" asked Rika, before she is sent into the clinic fully, leaving Kari and Mizo outside.

"Tell me.. what did you do with her? I don't care if it was consensual that night, she can't even remember what happened." said Kari, directly facing Mizo. "Oh? Did I say anything? I didn't say anything about that. I'd just assume she got a fever afterwards." responded Mizo, as Kari held Mizo's shoulders. "You implied **sex**. I will not let that slide unless you tell me, what actually happened. If anything, I should tell you, I'm one step away from reporting you. Not only for neglect, but also intentional malice." replied Kari, as Mizo smiled and tried to pull her closer but she pushed him away.

"What. are. you. trying. to do." asked Kari, as Mizo smiled and said, "Nothing. Just getting you out of my space, you know.. I have a girlfriend now. Rika." Kari looked at Mizo's eyes and responded, "Then.. you better make sure your girlfriend actually accepts you. She's my best friend. I can't let her be as confused and dazed as this." 

Mizo and Kari saw Rika come out, more fine, but was given some medicine that was in her sling bag that helped her recover. "Oh.. hi." greeted Rika to the two. Kari immediately hugged her as she whispered, "Rika. What happened last night?" Mizo was looking at them suspiciously. "Um.. I don't know. I.. don't remember what happened.. I just.. like.. um.. so.." responded Rika, as Kari glared at Mizo. "Leave. **_NOW._**" Mizo shrugged and left as Kari turned to face Rika again.

"I.. don't want you to hurt but.. based on the warning signs, I have to make sure you're fine. So, please.. what happened.. last night?" asked Kari again, gently holding Rika's hand. "I.. just.. rested.. after I went home yes? Um.. after.. uh.. Mizo kissed me. Then like.. he appeared..? I'm not sure what happened afterwards.. though.. why was he inside my bedroom?" explained Rika, as Kari's hold tightened. "I.. damn it. That.. guy needs to be arrested. Quick!" said Kari as she ran to the nearest authority.

_Hours later.._

"Under arrest for.." said the police officer, as Rika can barely hear and process what's happening as Kari explained the situation to the police officer while Mizo was being detained. "Her living situation? Mizo needs to get out. But.. he's.. nevermind. I'm moving in with her... Yeah, it's.. just temporary I guess, until he's.. fine? I do not know, but.. I am confident I can support her through it." said Kari to the officer as Rika can barely hear them talk to each other.

"I understand. Okay." said Kari before turning to Rika. "Hey, Rika.. uh.. based on.. eugh. **His** confession, he didn't fuck you, but he did touch you inappropriately. Um.. We.. had to check your body for.. any signs, sorry about that.. But, he's not lying this time." explained Kari, as Rika nodded. "Just, stay alive, okay? This.. whole thing will pass, and I'll be here with you." continued Kari, before turning to watch the police go out with Mizo to their police car.

## An Unspeakable Moment

## Author's Note:

Thought I wasn't going to make them kiss and have sex? You'd be right. Mostly. But, yet again, like I mention, this is just testing, like with all of the scenes here. Remember, all bonus scenes/spinoffs are NOT canon unless specified by me in author's notes such as this one, and btw let me reiterate that the reason these two are in DeltaRambles Main and not new series is because they're in the same world as DeltaRambles.

OR they are mentioned in the actual main story, which can happen, but usually I have an author's note

Anyways here's someone being.. an absolute.. predator while Rika is uh.. bound. **_WARNING: RAPE/NON-CON ELEMENTS_**

— jmb~ | January 27, 2025 | 08:12

---

Rika wakes up and sees herself bound to bed, with some ropes making her body spread out. "Ugh.. w—what?! Hey!! What the fuck is this?!" She shouts, she is completely naked also, then she sees her clothes on the floor beside her. "W—WHAT?!! HEY!!?? MIZO!! HELP!!!" screamed Rika, as she flailed in her restraints but failed to get out of it. 

"Haha.. No boyfriend is gonna save you now.." A random man appears, he seems to be an adult around 20-25 years old. "W—who the fuck are you?!" She asks as the man approaches her with a guitar. "Someone, who wants to sing a song to you~" He says, while holding her neck. "Agh! Stop.. get off." She says, before he starts playing the guitar. "That's.. Polly?!! What are you.. oh no." She says, before he starts singing mockingly;

"Polly wants a cracker.." The man then forces himself on top of Rika. "HEY!!!!! GET THE FUCK—" She screamed, before she was shut up by the man with his finger. "Polly wants a cracker~" The man sings with more force as he takes out a cracker and force-feeds it to Rika, she consumes it and doesn't feel well. "Maybe I should get off her first.. I think she wants some water.." The man grabbed a blowtorch and threatened Rika, as she whimpered. "To put out.." The man started the blowtorch, making Rika look at it. "..the blowtorch." The man then turns it off and puts it away.

"Isn't me.." Rika shudders as she tries to get the man off of her. "..have a seed, let me clip dirty wings.." The man then gets.. a jar of.. "I—is that.. cum.. oh god help me.." Rika says as she gulps and closes her eyes in anticipation. "Let me take a ride, cut yourself.." The man says, as he dumps the jar's contents to her crotch area, while 'riding' her. She flinches and tries to get him off  again, before the man cuts her arm, making her scream in pain. "Ah?!! My.. arm.." She gets progressively weaker, as she feels her arm bleed out. "Want some help? Please myself." He starts rubbing his bulge in her dry pussy. "Stop.. gosh.. I can't even.. scream now.. I'm bleeding.." Rika says weakly as she barely registers the violation.

"Got some rope, have been told.. Promise you, have been true." He smirks as he bandages her arm. Rika feels strange and hazy, she can't see clearly nor can she feel straight anymore, there's no pleasure only confusion. "Polly wants a cracker, maybe she would like some food?" He force-fed her more crackers. "Mmnn.. please.. finish this.. end me.." Rika says weakly, as the man laughs and continues, "She asked me to untie her.. A chase would be nice for a few." 

Rika slumps and limps as she begs in a weak voice, "Mizo.. help.." before the man continues. "Polly said.. Polly says her back hurts.." He looks at Rika, as she nods weakly. "Back.. hurts..." He then continued, "She's just as bored as me.. She caught me off my guard, amazes me, the will of instinct.." The man looks at Rika like a plaything getting more malleable as a burst of light shines through the room.

"RIKA!" Mizo apprehends the man, and gets him off Rika. The man manages to get off Mizo and hurriedly run away before Mizo untied Rika's weak self and hurried the fuck out of there.

## Polly

## Author's Note:

It's pretty clear what this is about, but just in case you haven't read the chapter before; **_WARNING: RAPE/NON-CON._** This is the aftermath of the whole thing.

"Mizo.. mizo.. help.." Rika mumbles as Mizo comforts her in her own room, while she is laying on her bed, with a blanket over her. "It's okay, it's okay.. Rika.. I'm here." Mizo holds her hand as she tenses up. "Are you.. him?" She asks, as he nodded. "I'm him. Mizo. Mizo Ibasa." He smiles as Rika uses her weak body to snuggle up to Mizo. "I.. can't help.. but feel.. the need for you.. I hate it." Rika says weakly, as she grabs Mijo to herself.

"I just hope.. that.. you take away all my.. my hurt.. pleasee.. I'm so tired.." Rika says to him, as Mizo brushes her hair. "I'll make an exception tonight. We are **best friends,** but.. I think you **do** need some.. company." Mizo says as he kisses her forehead. "That's.. too far.. but.. I can't stop you.." added Rika, as she hugged Mizo tightly. "Then I'll stop." said Mizo as he accepted the hug.

"Thank you." She says before separating. "You didn't.. dress me, did you?" Rika asks, as Mizo nods and looks at her drawer. "I wasn't going to touch you without your consent. What did you think?" answered Mizo, as Rika blushed a bit and looked away. "Fuck.. yeah. Um, I just.. expected you.. nevermind. That was dumb of me to say, you're.. not.. that.. yeah. I'm getting it myself." Rika got out of her blanket, and Mizo quickly looked away. "Sis.. you're naked.." Mizo says, as Rika stood up and went to her drawer, while Mizo kept his gaze away.

"You're in my room. And, so..? You can get the fuck out maybe..?" She asks, her tone a bit playful but meaning. "Mhm. Understood." Mizo leaves the room. "Wait..! Where.. did my.. um.. other clothes go?" Rika asks as Mizo had already left. "Damn it." Rika looked back at her closet and got some comfy pajamas before following Mijo out. "Um, Mijo.. what.. um.. where did my previous.. you know.." Rika air quotes; 'those..' before continuing, "..clothes. Get me?"

Mijo answered as he showed the clothes, "Oh, here they are.. Unfortunately, I was too late to get them before the man tried to make it his.. by ripping it in a way that's overtly sexualized. Though, when I returned, he seemed to be gone and a policewoman was there and looked at me. She said like;" 

"Who are you?" asked the policewoman as Mizo stepped back. "I'm.. Mizo. Mizo Ibasa. Y—you know me, I met the police and told them I'm the victim's friend, named Rika Crusi. I told them.. that I was carrying her home and that she was mostly fine, aside from a few wounds. She is sound asleep, and she's at her home now. I'm here to retrieve her clothes.." answered Mizo, as the policewoman nodded. "Oh, yes. You're that Mizo kid. I found this." The policewoman gave him ripped clothes. "Oh, this is.." Mijo trails off, as the policewoman stood up and looked around. "The criminal's an escape convict.. He stole the clothes of the person in this room, since the person was out for the weekend. Don't worry about this now." The policewoman gave a thumbs up as Mizo left.

"Oh.. then I'd have to get new ones.." Rika says, as she looks at the ripped clothes. "Thanks for trying to get them back, at least." She says as she sighs and walks away to put them into her drawer. After she did, she went to see Mizo. 

"I.. I'm.. clean.. though." Rika thought out loud, as she sat next to Mizo. "Um, how did you.. uh.. get me clean from that.. that event, yeah.. I was wondering because.. you know, infection and disease stuff.. related to things like this.." Rika asked, as Mizo recalled what exactly happened after he got her and her clothes to her house. "Hmm.. Well, I figured a bath would be good so I gave you a warm bath by carrying you there, and letting you rest there for a while and letting you.. dry. Um, forgive me though, I had to look closely at your.. sensitive areas and give you multiple baths just to get you clean enough. After I wrapped you in a towel, and let you dry in it, I then placed you on the bed and waited." Mizo explains as Rika tilts her head in confusion.

"Wait.. so in those.. hours I never woke up? I don't remember any of that. Um, would you say I was.. conscious?" asked Rika as Mizo tilted his head to the left and right. "Kinda. But, I was focused on your body's health first. I remember you helping me move you around a bit, and.. when you tapped me on the shoulder when you were dry enough." explained Mizo as Rika nodded. "Ohhh.. figures. I don't remember.. but probably because I was just unconsciously helping you do stuff, while my mind was still blank.. I guess thanks for that too? Damn, that must've been a lot of work moving me around, haha.." Rika says, giving a light touch on Mizo's chin.

"Well what else? I don't know.." Rika says as she goes closer to Mizo. "Let's just move on for now...  Are you.. okay?" asked Mizo, as Rika nodded hesitantly. "Fine today.. I guess."  Rika starts to use her phone. "Then.. okay." Mizo looks at his phone too and starts using it.

## Where the Fire Burns

## Author's Note:

So.. to refresh yourself from the previous chapter, and continue the more canon yet sexual moments of Mizo/Rika Saga, I have 
made this! Uh.. well, **_Sexual content, duh._**

Edit 1: Semi-canon fr fr? Anyway, this could be a chapter if it wasn't for the sexual moment in this.

"You know, you look.. like.." said Mizo as he looked at Rika eating a caramel ice cream with a big cone. "Huuh?" asked Rika, before Mizo smirked and shook his head. "Nevermind. It wouldn't make sense." continued Mizo, as Rika was about to retort but just decided to continue eating her ice cream. Mizo was waiting around for her to finish eating as they sat somewhere quite secluded in a super mall. Then Mizo decided to look around before suddenly Mizo straddled himself on Rika who was sitting still, as she gasped in surprise as the heat between them increased, but she didn't push him away.

"Mizo?! Um.. I'm not done—" said Rika before Mizo kissed her on the lips, she was initially surprised as Mizo dominated her mouth. She lets out an involuntary whimper as Mizo pulled back.. "I.. uh.. um.. Mizo, I.. just.. let me finish my— Mmmph~!" said Rika before Mizo kissed her again, as his hands navigate to her firm breasts covered by her shirt, undershirt and bra. "Nnngh.. Mizo.." Rika whispered as Mizo slightly pulled back, letting her breathe. "My... ice cream.." said Rika as she finally gets to finish her ice cream while Mizo starts moving a hand to her skirt.

"Eh.. Mizo.. I.. uh.. I'm not sure about.. any.. um.. more intimacy around the mall.." said Rika as her hands drift to his hands, one on her clothes breasts, and one on her inner thigh. "Oh..? Guess I was.. getting too immersed, I wouldn't want to have an audience, but.." said Mizo as he settled his to instead pull Rika into a hug, while kissing her. "Mizo..." repeated Rika before pulling back and stood up. "I understand, but here's the thing, what do... you want? As in, **IF** we have private time, what do you want from this whole.. uh.. intimacy? I'm not opposed to anything really, I just need to know." asked Mizo as he sits back nearby and Rika holds her arms with a slight blush.

"Ah.. I.. well.. I'm just not used to speaking about my sexual preferences to my.. best friend, much less a boy." said Rika, as she scratched her head. "What do you think?" asked Rika, as Mizo responded, "Um.. you definitely have a deranged and hidden sexual preference, otherwise.. why would something.. 'vanilla' ironically enough, would be weird to say to me?" Rika blushed intensely and shook her head. "Sh—shut up! It.. it's just.. It's not.. well, how about you start huh?! Feeling so confident.." asked Rika, as Mizo smirked.

"Oh? Then I like.. B.D.S.M..! Do I have to elaborate?" said Mijo, as Rika turned her head in a bit of shock as Mijo made his point clear as he patted her head while going closer to her face. "Nngh.. Ah! Stop.. stop.. I can't stop myself from... making sounds and shit.." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled and pulled back. "I don't think I need to know anyway, you seem the type to be very.. very.. **submissive** when in these situations like these, yes?" asked Mizo, as he made Rika look at his eyes, eliciting a slight shiver and strained whimpers from her. "I.. stop.. for a moment. Need to catch myself.." said Rika, as she felt super heated and her heart pounding. Mizo pulled back again as she held herself to steady the emotions mixing together.

"You know, maybe we should get the heat off already at your place, before you die haha." said Mizo, as Rika immediately starts blushing again. "Fine, fine.. I hate you so much.. for making me act this way. Let's just.. get it done, I.. hate being like this.." responded Rika, as Mizo hugged her while helping her back up. "Ahh~ N—no~ Just.. ah.." mumbled Rika, before  Mijo pulled back and they walked to her house, getting out of the super mall, the entire time, Rhida was very red while Mizo kept her vigilant with occasional kisses on the cheeks.

Once they finally went inside Rika's house, Mizo wasted no time helping Rika settle down, then when Rika was about to go into her bedroom, Mizo managed to bother her, and as she turned around, Mizo kissed her as he pushed her inside her room, then to her bed. He pulled back, as Rika was limp and heavily breathing. "M—Mizo... I didn't.. expect that.. but.. I'll let you.. manhandle me, just this.. time." commented Rika, as Mizo nodded and played with Rika's hair. "Are you happy.. dummy?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded and kissed her again.

"Mmmph.." mumbled Rhida as Mizo kissed her more intimately, going deep in her mouth. Rika melted into his kiss, accepting everything he's doing, but she gets a bit confused and needy when he eventually pulls back and looks at her all satisfied. "Huh..? Why.. did you stop?" asked Rika, as Mizo gently started to part her legs, revealing her pink shorts covering her inner parts. "Ah? T—there..?" said Rika, as Mizi started to slowly take off her pink shorts, to reveal the red damp panties that Mizo smiled and moved his hands to touch it. "Gosh.. this is really happening.. mmnn..." said Rika, before a small whimper escaped her lips as Mizo started rubbing.

"J—just be careful.. I..very.. hazy.. when.. aroused like this.." said Rika as Mizo looked at her with a clear face on clarification of what she said. "J—just.. y—you.. ah.. the.. whole.. experience.. the.. being aroused part.. Makes me dizzy.. D—don't worry though.. My body just acts that way.." explained Rika, as Mizo watched Rika's very red face and her panties as he took them off and prepared to go inside, Rika seems so pliant and limp in his hands, yet he wants to be delicate about it.

"I.. just gotta ask, because.. while I trust you're saying the truth.. Do you really want to.. do this whole thing, or are you just.. following my lead?" asked Mizo, as he stood up and looked directly at her face. "M—Mizo.." said Rika as she adjusted herself to a more comfortable position. "I.." Rika sighs and looks at herself. "I don't trust myself to not.. ruin this whole thing between us. I.. just.. I don't know If.. if.. I would accept myself just.. retreating inward." explained Rika, as Mijo laid beside her, looking at her with concern.

"Mizo.. it's not that I.. don't have the desire to.. but, I'm just so.. conflicted. I'd.. rather accept this.. whole dynamic between us, let you take the leading role. I'm.. I.. don't want to just.. say that I want.. this. What If I don't in the future? It's.. getting night.. All I want is.. comfort. Please, if.. there'd be anything I would say.. It's.. that I would respond. Always, if anything.. I trust you to be gentle with the tsundere girl with her own problems." continued Rika, before hugging Mizo. Both pulled back after a while, and Mizo asked, "So.. do you still have the 'mood'?"

"Yeah, I can see it in your face.. My.. speech made you lose your.. drive. Me too, and.. it sucks." answered Rika, laying her head on the wall behind her. "It's fine.. I'm not that horny, besides.. we're still best friends. We've gone through a lot without navigating this weird romance." responded Mijo, as he gently sat beside her as she put her head on his shoulder, slightly blushing. They were quiet, the electric fan buzzing through the stillness. She shifted a bit, tugging her shirt as she grabbed her shorts and wore them again.

"D—don't get any ideas though.. I'm getting used to.. this. I can retaliate." she mumbled, her voice half-sharp and half-soft. "I might get red.. but.. I'm not melting whenever you look at me all weird okay? Got that?!" Her cheek pressed on his shoulders, her voice getting louder. "Haha.. I'll keep it in mind. I'll just continue to be more surprising then. Ooh! Maybe.." said Mizo as he made Rika look at him with that grin.

Rika was confused, but before she could say anything, Mizo booped her nose and chuckled. "Hm? What were you thinking? Hehe.. Anyways, we got a bunch of stuff to do.. or..?" asked Mizo, as Rika narrowed her eyes and slapped him, gently. "Hah! Shush.. You're _baiting_ me.. You know my answer." answered Rika, as she hugged him to make him fall to her bed more, she is on top, while he's on the bottom. "Ohoh? Are you..?" said Mizo, as Rika had a slight blush before pulling him back up. "Nope. Stop thinking about it! I swear, you always think about sex.." responded Rika, with a smirk.

"Can't help it. A girl pushes me on _her_ bed and she's _on top_, blushing and smirking.. I'd be a bit of a stone head if I didn't see the implications." said Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Shut upp.. You started this.." responded Rika as Mizo got close to her face, just enough to not kiss her. "You're welcome." whispered Mizo, before pulling back. Rika shook her head slightly with a smirk as they lay together in her bed, resting.

"Hey.. can you.. uh.. come into my room..?" asked Rika, calling Mizo through her phone. "Hm? Why?" questioned Mizo, as Rika slightly blushed. "I.. need someone to talk about this.. okay...?" answered Rika, as Mizo replied, "Aight." then a few seconds later, someone knocked at Rika's door. "Come in.." said Rika, as Mizo went inside and sat beside her. "So.. what's gotten you so flustered? Usually, I'd see you like this if I—" asked Mizo, before Rika held his hand tightly. "Sh—shut.. up.. B—but.. I uh.. well.." stuttered Rika, as she took a deep breath and looked at Mizo.

"Wanna.. review some hentai with me?" asked Rika, as Mizo is slightly flustered and widened his eyes a bit. Quickly though, he smirks and looks at Rika in the eyes and answers, "Oh? Yes, but.. May I ask why?". Rika blushes more intensely, and looks away. "F—for fun. Please don't take it any other way, it's just been a rough few months for me.. B—besides, we get to 'learn' more about each other...!" blurted out Rika, as Mizo nodded and chuckled.

"Aight, if that's how you want to frame it. Though, before I let this go, can I just say that only high school couples that are VERY close with each other do this?" asked Mizo, as Rika held Mizo's shoulders and looked at him directly in the eyes, a bit irritated. "Sh—shut up..! I—I know that.. but.. we're.. different, okay? Best friends who trust each other with this stuff." said Rika, before pulling back.

"Mhm. I'm convinced~" said Mizo as he opened up his phone and opened up his favorite hentai website, on private mode of course. Rika does the same. "Who's going first? I have so many, but I want to.. ahem.. start with this one." said Mizo, as he shows her a certain comic about a character being.. raped and mind-broken by a particularly strong man after a decisive war. 

"W—what.. this.. is.. crazy.. you.. use this material?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded, feeling a bit vulnerable. "Mhm. Don't worry, it's all fantasy. But yeah, this is the.. summary of the many.. hentais I look at. Mainly the 'rape' tag, and the 'mind break/control' tag." explained Mizo, as Rika seems to be shaking for an unknown reason. "O—okay... I know, it's all just fantasy and shit, but.. I.. I've never seen you.. you know, be as.. uh.. let's say sex-crazed and coercive to do these to.. wait, do I see a... 'slave' tag?" responded Rika, as Mizo nodded, both of them fully horny now.

"Yeah, that's.. that's also part of it. Though I tend to leave it off, it's a reoccurring tag I click and.. enjoy to." explained Mizo, as Rika nodded slowly. "Mmmnn.. Those.. uh.. breakdowns. Shit, I'm.. yeah. This is.. very prone.. to..." said Rika, as she looked at the images a bit closer and felt the ache on her crotch intensify as she looked away. "Look, I don't want to know if you're horny or not, but I know you probably are... It's just.. so humiliating for the woman there.." said Rika, as she brushed her hair and shook her head to clear her thoughts.

"I think she's a great general in the canon right? This is technically a r34 version. She's.. being.. taken, by the enemy she defeated in the game.. It's just.. why.. do so many.. dynamics fall into this? I know her backstory was of a slave, but.. it seems that if.. like, a female who is strong and beautiful gets released, and they have a vaguely antagonistic relationship with someone, there pours in the various.. comics about dominating the girl. You know, I'm.. quite rebellious, if you can call it that.. So the whole.. whiplash is.. real." mused Rika, as Mizo thought about what she said.

"That.. is true. I agree. I've thought about it when writing and sometimes just looking at the most popular ones.. There's a trend. What about you though? I'm sure you got something equally.. surprising." said Mizo, as Rika nodded and showed him her selection. It's about two guys, one is a bully, but on the start, he turns into a girl, and basically was raped in the first instance, and well.. is sexually coerced eventually to become the bullied boy's girlfriend/fuck-buddy, constantly being sexually aroused by the boy and humiliated.

"Hm. I thought you would like lesbian or gay hentai more..?" asked Mizo, as Rika moves her head side to side as a 'maybe'. "Well.. they all do the same thing! Without specific looking and more... deep searches, most of the hentai is straight! See, even if I find one, it's like.. you're using a dick, why not just be a man and fuck thay way? I guess.. strap-ons but full large dicks..? Also, those.. scenes, like they're way too big to fit in any boxers, much less panties. T—that's why.. I've found.. well, as you can see.. These. Um, well.. I'm quite embarrassed now." explained Rika, as Mizo took a minute to look through the panels of the hentai.

"Rape.. gender change..? How.. quaint. Hmm.. Seems like we have about the same penchant for.. non-consenting acts, manifesting in different ways. I like more brutal ones, more rough. You tend to.. hm, this character, wouldn't you say she has.. a certain 'tsundere' to her when she gets turned to a girl?" asked Mizo, as Rika further blushed and nodded. "Mhm. Yeah, you tend to.. like.. people switching. Where, someone turns to another, like mine actually. Only difference is mine is more magical and forceful and yours is more coercive and hidden, am I correct, dear friend?" continued Mizo, as Rika nodded before burying her face in her pillows.

After Rika felt her confidence level up a bit, she went and took her phone from Mizo as they locked eyes. "I.. uh.. you know, I.. learned a lot from this exchange. Um, promise me.. You.. never will.. you know, do 'that'..?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded and held her other free hand. "I promise. Sometimes, it even gets.. disgusting sometimes y'know? So, while this.. is my kinks, I won't.. forsake anything for it. Not with you. Not anyone else." promised Mizo, as Rika nodded. 

"Y—yeah.. I'm just.. self-aware now of that girl getting coerced and dominated in the hentai. I.. as arousing as it is, I know I wouldn't actually like being raped, then sexually assaulted, then raped, continuously, until I 'enjoy' it. I'm just.. feeling so.. weird to you, you know? If we both like non-con stuff, what's stopping us from betraying each other..?" mused Rika, as Mizo reassured her, "We won't. I won't. I know you won't. Just... be aware of both of our boundaries I guess, though I'm more forward about testing that than you are to me."

"I—I know. Okay.. I just.. need some release. Um.. I don't know..! If I should fulfill it or not, it's just so.. embarrassing now, looking at the hentai again." said Rika, as she suddenly hugs Mizo, both horny, both incredibly aroused now by each other. "Rika! You'll.." said Mizo, as Rika mumbles, "I know.. I feel.. you. Just, don't do anything, just hug, okay?" Mizo nodded, embracing the hug, but Mizo's bulge is above her pussy, while her breasts strain from her shirt and his chest. 

Rika eventually pulls back, her face flushed, panting and looks away. "T—that's enough.. thanks for.. not doing anything." said Rika, as she grabbed her phone, still a bit shaky. Mizo smirked, shifting to ease his arousal. "Yeah. Glad I can help you with that.. Hey, at least no messes to clean up right?" teased Mizo, as he went closer, getting her attention. "You, red? Cute~" whispered Mizo, as Rika further blushes.

"Gah! Sh—shut up!" snapped Rika, as she threw the pillow nearby to his face. "I'm.. not.. hmph. Whatever. D—dumbass." continued Rika before she huffed as Mizo took the pillow and put it down on the bed. "Well, well... Looks like my tsundere is a bit red still? Hm, I'll let you go now, but.. hey, stay vigilant~!" responded Mizo before pulling out his phone and the room quiets down.
