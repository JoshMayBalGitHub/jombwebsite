## 'Negative' Creep

"Hey.. Weird question, have you watched pron before?" She asks me, as I gasp and stumble on my words. "Any teen would have honestly, but there's a jarring lack of popularity for women centered ones..!" She continues, as I look at her and chuckle. "What...? Then you haven't looked far enough. Lesbian and Gay people fucking is somewhat a popular fandom in it." I responded, she widened her eyes and looked at me, with a faint smile. "How do you know huh?! Are you gay or something?" She asks, while keeping her hands in her chest.

"Nope. Still straight. But, I've been liking it more.. of the lesbian side of things, usually either intense or gentle.." I admit, as she blushes and looks away. "What..?! What..! That doesn't make sense..! You're straight, don't you like the usual dominating men fucking submissive women..?" She asks as I nod, "Well I do, but I've broadened my taste." I respond as she looks at me again, grabbing a pillow. 

"What.." She says, before sighing. "Forget about it. It was a mistake speaking to you about any.. sexual stuff. You look like a negative creep anyway." She says before looking away, as I respond, "You're the one who brought it up, Rika." I continued drawing a comic for a performance task that was so late now. "Shut up, Mizo. Continue your late drawing, be happy that ma''am doesn't reject late tasks." She says, as I chuckle.

"Like you're any better. That's the essay I helped you with, last week..! You're so late there that I'm considering helping you to give something to pass." I say, as she playfully slapped me. "Shush." She says, holding up a finger at my mouth as I nod, and continues my drawing.

After a while of silence, I went away to take a break in her bedroom, while I was spending my hours chilling with my phone, she went into the room and was a bit surprised. "W—what are you.. doing here..?" She asks, as I jump in surprise. "Oh..? I'm sorry, I didn't... uh.. just thought your room was much more comfier.." I say, as she faintly blushes a bit. She asks me, "W—why are you here anyway..? Are you procrastinating.. it's been like... an hour or so.." 

"Wait.. an hour..! Then I need to get back..!" I stand up and try to leave but she stops me. "Wait..!" She calls out, prompting me to look at her and ask, "Hmm? What?" She looked like she was about to say something before she pulled back. "N—nothing. Move on." She says, holding her own arm. "If you say so." I say, before moving, feeling a bit unsure of what she wanted to say.

I started drawing again, and I saw it in the corner of my eyes, she went out and started typing, without saying a word to me. After a while, I saw her come up to me. "Hey.. you done..?" She asked, and I answered, "No.. but are you..?" She shook her head and just sat back down, I didn't get to see what she was doing, but I didn't hear typing from her mechanical keyboard, and I didn't hear her phone play audio, so I only could assume she left the room or was staring off.

I took a break after the second page, and thought to myself, "Man that second page sucks ass to look at, but.. that's the limit of creativity.. I don't fuckin know why people expect magnum opuses due in 2 weeks, with 10 more tasks to do too." I then looked at Rika, she was just staring at her laptop screen, she probably wasn't reading it, considering the screen wasn't moving and her hands were on her lap, shaking.

"Hey... Rika..?" I call out, as she jumps up and looks at me, panting. "W—what?! I.. nothing. I was.. just.. AAAHHH!!" She responds, pushing me to the couch with a tight hug. "Hey?! What..! Rika..!" I protested, but I eventually put my hands around her back. "Mizo.. I don't want to be a student anymore.." She mumbles to me, while clearly holding back tears. "I don't want to exist..." She continued, getting more intense with her hug, as I felt her body heat up and shake.

"What.. I.. why..?" I ask, as she rolls me around the couch while I can feel her tears fall to my shirt. "I'm so tired.. Mizo.. but all I can do is worry about the next thing.. until the end of the school year.. and with that.. us.." She starts sobbing, as I gently pat her back while regrouping my thoughts. "Is this also about the research defense next week?" I ask, as I feel her tighten and flinch at my question. She tried to say something, but I couldn't understand her mumbles before she just stopped herself and was on the verge of bashing herself and me to the wall nearby.

"Please.. I don't know what I want.. anymore.. Do I want to be  husband and wife with.. you, or just really close best friends..? A—and.. will I get out of these.. cycles..? I don't want to hurt you, but I.. hurt so much.." She explains as she slightly releases from me but then hugs me again tightly before she continues. "God.. my parents barely understand me.. but every time.. I feel they've invalidated me.. or just.. don't.. leave me.. alone.. I shouldn't attach myself to you, but I can't help myself.. Please.. please.. I don't know why I'm saying it at this point.."

I try to process and listen to her, but I also start feeling more hazy, and I try to get her off, since I don't trust myself not accidentally getting a boner from this. "Mizo..?" Riza willingly lets me release from her but she was so shook up as she is looking at me while keeping her hands close to her chest. "Mizo.. why.." She stops herself, and nods, closing her eyes and going to her bedroom and locking it. I looked at her door, I don't know what she felt about it, but I didn't know if I should intervene, so I just sat down and tried to calm myself down.

But, my mind drifted off somewhere, I looked at my phone, and then I felt my boner slowly spring up, as my mind wanders to her very intimate hug. "No..! Stop.. it you horny Mizo.." I say to myself, but I know that I have to release it, least risking damaging Rika's trust in me with her bond. I keep my thoughts to myself as I head to the bathroom with my phone, ready to fulfill a sexual obligation I don't really desire, but feel so inclined to.

After I finished my obligation, I went out and saw Rika writing in her notebook. Her tears are still falling, but more reserved now. "Rika.." I say, as Rika looks at me and instantly tenses up. "M—mizo.." She says as she takes her notebook and moves away from the couch to the kitchen table. "Rika..! It's fine." I say, as she shakes her head intensely and struggles to keep writing. I hesitate to do anything, before sighing and sitting on the couch while I hear her occasional sob when writing.

"Damn it.. I can't believe I just.. did that because of her... I couldn't remove my mind from her.. body.. Not just.. not just how she touched me.. But.. my unwilling fantasies. I still remember vividly how many times she caught and almost caught me looking at very NSFW images.. and writing too, and I looked at her with a shameful lustful expression before I left hurriedly."  I thought to myself, as he can feel my boner rise again. "Shit.. no no.. stop.." I try to hide it with a pillow, unaware that Rika was staring at me that entire time.

She closes her notebook, then comes up to me and sits beside me. She looked at me, all depressed before letting herself drift off to sleep, with the notebook on the nearby table. I found myself drifting to look at her curves before pulling back, "Why am I feeling this about her..! I can't just let my best friend be objectified and sexualized like this.. When she trusts me with this.." I say to myself as she unconsciously falls, her head resting on the pillow on my lap.

"I'm.. just.. going to follow her to dreamland.. Hopefully she doesn't feel any morning wood later.." I say, before I also drift to sleep.

## The Hazy Speak

## Author's Note:

Title. basically.. let's say certain things lead to certain events, and this is before the chill ones, to not get whiplash. As always, **_NON-CON and SEXUAL WARNING!_**

Very predatory Mizo.

"W—what are you doing?!" asked Rika as Mizo kissed her as he pinned her arms on her top while pushing her to the wall behind her. "Mizo! Stop!! I'm seri—" shouted Rika before kissing her again, silencing her with an involuntary whimper.

"N—nnmmnn.. please.. I beg.. we're at school—" said Rika before she felt Mizo tug her shorts and panties down, revealing her bare hairy pussy, somewhat wet. "N—no.. not here.. not—" said Rika, as she gasped when Mizo pulled out his massive dick and was trying to enter. "Mizo! Stop—" said Rika as Mizo wasn't stopping, Rika saw a glimpse of his face, she doesn't even know if the boy she was looking at was the Muzo she knew. Only that he was raping her, and horrifying to her, she was enjoying it.

"If you.. want it.. just.. make it less—" said Rika, as she couldn't even say her final words as Mizo finally entered inside her. "AHHHH!!! STOP STOP PULL OUT PLEASE!!!!" screamed Rika, it felt painful to have this inside her, she couldn't bear the amount of haze and pain going through her body. Rika is hyperventilating and is trying to push him back but his strength keeps her pinned.

"Gotta get out.. please.. don't.." muttered Rika, before Mizo started moving intensely inside her. "Ah.. no.. stop.. stop.. mmn.." said Rika, as she whimpered due to the intense pain and arousal going through her body, she is begging herself to not falter, to not submit. "Can't.. like this.. can't let him know.." said Rika, as she tried to push him away.

Mizo kissed her, hard and deep, Rika is trying to push away, but his chest pushing on her breasts, makes it clear what his intentions are. She arches her back as she tries to push him away again, but then he pulls back and unbuttons her polo and takes off her black bra. "Mmmnn.. Wait. please... A—at least.. ahh!!! No!! Noo... no.. mmmnn..." said Rika as Mizo sucks on her tits while fucking her, Rika can feel his dick pulse and felt a bit of arousal and intense scare.

"Please.. stop! Pull out, at least.. I don't take.. anything.. I don't want to have to abort someone.. I don't even want to have a child.. Please please pull out.." said Rika, as she begs on Mijo, with no response as she felt he get closer and closer. "No no!! No.. Pull out. Get me.. nnnmmm.." said Rika, as Mizo came inside her. She gasps and whimpers as she felt that strange liquid fill her up, she feels like a lot come in, and she's overwhelmed and scared.

**_"No.. I.. I'm gone... I should.. die."_**

After coming inside her, he pulls out and grabs the traumatized Rika, and puts her polo back, before groping her ass and then inserting inside her ass. "Please.. no more.. You've hurt me.. raped me.. please.. just make it stop.." said Rika, as she is now weak. Mizo let go of her hands as he handled her hips and continued moving inside her. "Get.. out.. I don't want to fight anymore.. just.. snap my neck. Please, grab my neck.. break me, don't you want someone to **use?"** said Rika, as Mizo taunted her by grabbing her neck but just letting it stay there.

He comes inside her ass as he grabs her and makes her suck his dick, his dick doesn't even fit inside, but he continues anyway, fucking her until he comes inside and pulls out. "Eugh.. disgusting.. piece of shit.. AHHM?!" said Rika, as she is put on top of the balcony they're nearby and she is fucked on her pussy again, but if she pulls back, she's going to fall over. "No! Not like this.. no no no.." muttered Rika, as she feels scared to even move as the haziness overtakes any amount of pain and pleasure she's experiencing.

"No.. No!! I'm going to—" said Rika as she fell unconscious, and Mizo pulled her to him and carried her.

_Hours later.._

"Ugh.." said Rika, as she wakes up on her bed. "What.. happe— AHH?!" said Rika, before Mizo pinned her to the bed and activated a vibrator attached to her pussy, ass and nipples. Rika is instantly faltering, and whimpers and moans take over. "Mnnn.. what's this.. stop.. whoever.. ahh.. no.. can't.. think.. only fuuuckk...." said Rika as she orgasmed involuntarily, and Mizo kissed her to sleep.

## Desired Object

## Author's Note:

I do not know how I got to this point, nor how I got the idea.. But, it's like.. a mix of the perverse desire to just use sexual desire as a coping mechanism and how I'd been experiencing sickness these past few weeks (yeah, while mine isn't that traumatic, if you read it, you can guess how I know how the processing of the whole thing.)

— jmb~ | Feb 14, 2025 | 9:19

"Hey.. we.. need to be at school for the.. exam, I don't think you're studying.. so.. let's just eat already.." said Rika outside of Mizo's door, as Mizo was busy.. touching himself to various images of hentai. "Mizo..?" continued Rika as Mizo finished and headed to his bathroom to clean up before answering Rika. "Yeah? Yeah." said Mizo as his gaze clearly lingered over her form. Rika dragged him away before he could fully process what he was doing, with a faint blush. "Let's just eat brunch, this one. Hotdog and eggs, plus rice." said Rika as she sat down and started to eat, Mizo felt Rika was side-eyeing him.

After eating, Rika spoke up. "I'm done. You should clean them. I'm heading to the shower first." Rika then was about to go and stand up, when Mizo rushed to eat all of his food then ran to the sink first. "Nah. You do it." Mizo then ran to the shower, not before taking his towel. Rika sighed and rolled her eyes as she moved to clean their plates.

Mizo.. uh, he indulged in a bit more.. inappropriate activities inside the bathroom, and so when Rika was done and picked up her towel and headed to the bathroom, Mizo was still inside. "Mizo..? Come on.. we're technically not going to be late, but you're really stretching that leeway I gave to ourselves." said Rika, as she visibly heard the beating of.. meat? "Ugh. YOU'VE ALREADY.. Nevermind. Just.. go and be faster." Rika then heads to a mirror nearby to brush her hair as she waits for Mizo to be done.

Finally, Mizo was done as Rika went to the bathroom, and when she was done, she saw Mizo nowhere but she did hear noises from his bedroom. "Don't tell me.." Rika rushed and peeked over to Mizo's bedroom, he hadn't even closed the door as he.. indulged in self-pleasuring activities. Before Rika could burst in anger, she covered her mouth to shut up and left quickly. She went to her own bedroom to start drying and dress up but she couldn't get the image out of her head. "What the fuck is he thinking..? He hasn't reviewed the notes I gave him, he hasn't.. hasn't even joined me in that quick raid in the videogame! He's just.. been like that since the week started. Might need to speak to him after the exams.. Ugh.. why do people have to be so—" muttered Rika before she audibly gasped when she heard a knock.

"H—HEY?! What.. do you want?" asked Rika, as Mizo was clearly sarcastic in his tone, "Are you done yet? I've been waiting for a while.." Rika retorted, "OH SHUT THE FUCK UP! I'm getting there..! Maybe if you're faster at getting prepared because you're a **man**, maybe just maybe start reviewing?! Or literally do anything productive?!" Mizo laughed and responded, "Oh I'm doing something productive, I'm just waiting for you now." before leaving.

"Fuckin.. fucking... ahh!!!" screamed Rika as she held on to her pillows to calm herself down. "It's fine.. it's fine.. I.. damn it. Can't falter in the last three now.. The last three exams, after this.. I can.. okay. One more day.." Rika then fixed herself up and grabbed her bag as Mizo was already outside, her own snack bag being on the table. She grabbed and checked it, the usual stuff, tumbler with iced water and some snacks. "At least.. he hasn't failed with this one.." Rika sighed and headed out as she closed the house and headed to where Mijo was waiting.

Mijo smirked and then got them a tricycle driver to drive them to their school. Rika was silently there as Mizo smiled the whole way, then he paid for them before they went inside the campus. Mizo was speaking to his friends nearby, while Rika was silently reviewing on her phone.

After the exams, Rika was waiting outside on her phone when she was surprised by Mizo, too close to her personal space. She immediately pushed him back as her heart was pounding. "W—what was that for..? Look, I know you're dumb and all and took time on that English Exam, but.. unnecessary!!" said Rika as she looks at Mizo accusatory, while he smirks. Rika can feel Mizo looking at her lips without even focusing on it. "Just.. do you have anything else to do? I was waiting, 'cause you might have post-Exam fun, and I just wanted to know so I can plan ahead." said Rika, as Mizo looked around and kissed her on the lips quickly before whispering, "Of course, I am going out with the boys after this, I just.. wanted to see you~" and then leaving quickly.

"What..." said Rika as she looked at Mizo meeting up with his friends, somewhat far away with intense blushing. "You can't just.." Rika is barely holding her anger and shame from what happened as she looked away and to the balcony to process what just happened.

"Why..?" Rika asked herself as she held her head in her hands. She starts to feel dizzy and hazy, the touch intensifying her confusion. She quickly starts to dissociate what just happened, and calms herself down. She looked around and saw Mizo and his friends leave the school as she sighs and heads off as well.

She silently goes on to her routine, listening to her usual Nirvana playlist, while walking in the afternoon. She eventually arrives at a mall, and buys some ice cream with sprinkles that she immediately ate. She then moves to the local bookstore and inspects the books, mostly she has seen before, then some new generic books for the week, because of Valentine's day. She then moves out and walks alone to her house, where she goes inside and goes to her bedroom to rest.

"You're the reason I feel pain.. But.. it feels so good to feel again.." muttered Rika to herself, as tears fell without her own reaction, mechanically switching to her home clothes. Then out of the blue, Mizo burst into the room and pushed Rika to her bed, half-naked. She immediately widened her eyes and instinctively tried to avoid him but he managed to pin her down quickly.

"What?! PLEASE STOP! PLEASE!!" shouted Rika as she was trying to get out of Mizo's grip. "You're.. so.. fuckable right now.." said Mizo, drunk and slurred. "Ah?!! Get the fuck off mee!!" screamed Rika as she tried to push him away, but Mizo started to move to her sensitive areas. "Ah..? No.. can't falter.. stop.. please..!" said Rika, as she tried to get Mizo's hands off her, but her body started reacting, and she was dizzy again. "No.. don't.. please.. don't ruin.. please.. ah.. no.." Rika says before Mizo kissed her on the lips. She blacked out after this, she did not know what happened during this whole violation.

_Unknown amount of time later.._

"W—where am I?" asked Rika as she looked around her surroundings, it's morning. In school, she's in her uniform, it's that day of Valentine's but she doesn't remember what happened or how she got here. "What.. I.." Rika looks around, normal students doing normal student things. It looks like they're preparing for the events today involving a partnership between the spanish club and the student government to have a Spanish Valentine's day. 

She walks to her classroom, seeing the normal atmosphere, the usual chatter of people, and their relationships. As for Rika, she doesn't know how she is here, or what happened but she just decides to sit down and process what she has just remembered.

"Rika?" asked Kari, as she sat down next to her. "Uh.. you.. fine? It's just a perf. day, besides.. there's still next week yeah?" said Kari, as she looked at her. "A headache. I feel.. my head is hurting." said Rika, as she felt her head hurt intensely. "Oh? Then.. you should probably go home no? Maybe take a trike' home?" asked Kari as Rika looked at Kari. "I don't know how I got here.. And.. I can't think well.." Rika says before falling unconscious.

_Rika..? Rika...!!!_

"Huh?" asked Rika as she is being brought to the clinic in a wheelchair as she sees Kari and..   **_MIZO._**

"Mizo?! What happened?! Why is she at school?!"

"Ah, well I simply just didn't check on her that well after last night."

"What happened last night?!"

"We had fun."

"Fun? What fun?"

"Ohoho it's a secret.. But I'll let you guess, it's an s and an x in the end."

"Huh.. HUH?!! WAIT WAIT—"

"Rika!!!" shouted Kari as she shook Rika's body. "Are you.. fine? Well, no what I mean is.." Kari goes closer, "Are you pregnant?" she asks as Rika shrugged and shook her head. "Don't know.. what you mean?" asked Rika, before she is sent into the clinic fully, leaving Kari and Mizo outside.

"Tell me.. what did you do with her? I don't care if it was consensual that night, she can't even remember what happened." said Kari, directly facing Mizo. "Oh? Did I say anything? I didn't say anything about that. I'd just assume she got a fever afterwards." responded Mizo, as Kari held Mizo's shoulders. "You implied **sex**. I will not let that slide unless you tell me, what actually happened. If anything, I should tell you, I'm one step away from reporting you. Not only for neglect, but also intentional malice." replied Kari, as Mizo smiled and tried to pull her closer but she pushed him away.

"What. are. you. trying. to do." asked Kari, as Mizo smiled and said, "Nothing. Just getting you out of my space, you know.. I have a girlfriend now. Rika." Kari looked at Mizo's eyes and responded, "Then.. you better make sure your girlfriend actually accepts you. She's my best friend. I can't let her be as confused and dazed as this." 

Mizo and Kari saw Rika come out, more fine, but was given some medicine that was in her sling bag that helped her recover. "Oh.. hi." greeted Rika to the two. Kari immediately hugged her as she whispered, "Rika. What happened last night?" Mizo was looking at them suspiciously. "Um.. I don't know. I.. don't remember what happened.. I just.. like.. um.. so.." responded Rika, as Kari glared at Mizo. "Leave. **_NOW._**" Mizo shrugged and left as Kari turned to face Rika again.

"I.. don't want you to hurt but.. based on the warning signs, I have to make sure you're fine. So, please.. what happened.. last night?" asked Kari again, gently holding Rika's hand. "I.. just.. rested.. after I went home yes? Um.. after.. uh.. Mizo kissed me. Then like.. he appeared..? I'm not sure what happened afterwards.. though.. why was he inside my bedroom?" explained Rika, as Kari's hold tightened. "I.. damn it. That.. guy needs to be arrested. Quick!" said Kari as she ran to the nearest authority.

_Hours later.._

"Under arrest for.." said the police officer, as Rika can barely hear and process what's happening as Kari explained the situation to the police officer while Mizo was being detained. "Her living situation? Mizo needs to get out. But.. he's.. nevermind. I'm moving in with her... Yeah, it's.. just temporary I guess, until he's.. fine? I do not know, but.. I am confident I can support her through it." said Kari to the officer as Rika can barely hear them talk to each other.

"I understand. Okay." said Kari before turning to Rika. "Hey, Rika.. uh.. based on.. eugh. **His** confession, he didn't fuck you, but he did touch you inappropriately. Um.. We.. had to check your body for.. any signs, sorry about that.. But, he's not lying this time." explained Kari, as Rika nodded. "Just, stay alive, okay? This.. whole thing will pass, and I'll be here with you." continued Kari, before turning to watch the police go out with Mizo to their police car.

## An Unspeakable Moment

## Author's Note:

Thought I wasn't going to make them kiss and have sex? You'd be right. Mostly. But, yet again, like I mention, this is just testing, like with all of the scenes here. Remember, all bonus scenes/spinoffs are NOT canon unless specified by me in author's notes such as this one, and btw let me reiterate that the reason these two are in DeltaRambles Main and not new series is because they're in the same world as DeltaRambles.

OR they are mentioned in the actual main story, which can happen, but usually I have an author's note

Anyways here's someone being.. an absolute.. predator while Rika is uh.. bound. **_WARNING: RAPE/NON-CON ELEMENTS_**

— jmb~ | January 27, 2025 | 08:12

---

Rika wakes up and sees herself bound to bed, with some ropes making her body spread out. "Ugh.. w—what?! Hey!! What the fuck is this?!" She shouts, she is completely naked also, then she sees her clothes on the floor beside her. "W—WHAT?!! HEY!!?? MIZO!! HELP!!!" screamed Rika, as she flailed in her restraints but failed to get out of it. 

"Haha.. No boyfriend is gonna save you now.." A random man appears, he seems to be an adult around 20-25 years old. "W—who the fuck are you?!" She asks as the man approaches her with a guitar. "Someone, who wants to sing a song to you~" He says, while holding her neck. "Agh! Stop.. get off." She says, before he starts playing the guitar. "That's.. Polly?!! What are you.. oh no." She says, before he starts singing mockingly;

"Polly wants a cracker.." The man then forces himself on top of Rika. "HEY!!!!! GET THE FUCK—" She screamed, before she was shut up by the man with his finger. "Polly wants a cracker~" The man sings with more force as he takes out a cracker and force-feeds it to Rika, she consumes it and doesn't feel well. "Maybe I should get off her first.. I think she wants some water.." The man grabbed a blowtorch and threatened Rika, as she whimpered. "To put out.." The man started the blowtorch, making Rika look at it. "..the blowtorch." The man then turns it off and puts it away.

"Isn't me.." Rika shudders as she tries to get the man off of her. "..have a seed, let me clip dirty wings.." The man then gets.. a jar of.. "I—is that.. cum.. oh god help me.." Rika says as she gulps and closes her eyes in anticipation. "Let me take a ride, cut yourself.." The man says, as he dumps the jar's contents to her crotch area, while 'riding' her. She flinches and tries to get him off  again, before the man cuts her arm, making her scream in pain. "Ah?!! My.. arm.." She gets progressively weaker, as she feels her arm bleed out. "Want some help? Please myself." He starts rubbing his bulge in her dry pussy. "Stop.. gosh.. I can't even.. scream now.. I'm bleeding.." Rika says weakly as she barely registers the violation.

"Got some rope, have been told.. Promise you, have been true." He smirks as he bandages her arm. Rika feels strange and hazy, she can't see clearly nor can she feel straight anymore, there's no pleasure only confusion. "Polly wants a cracker, maybe she would like some food?" He force-fed her more crackers. "Mmnn.. please.. finish this.. end me.." Rika says weakly, as the man laughs and continues, "She asked me to untie her.. A chase would be nice for a few." 

Rika slumps and limps as she begs in a weak voice, "Mizo.. help.." before the man continues. "Polly said.. Polly says her back hurts.." He looks at Rika, as she nods weakly. "Back.. hurts..." He then continued, "She's just as bored as me.. She caught me off my guard, amazes me, the will of instinct.." The man looks at Rika like a plaything getting more malleable as a burst of light shines through the room.

"RIKA!" Mizo apprehends the man, and gets him off Rika. The man manages to get off Mizo and hurriedly run away before Mizo untied Rika's weak self and hurried the fuck out of there.

## Polly

## Author's Note:

It's pretty clear what this is about, but just in case you haven't read the chapter before; **_WARNING: RAPE/NON-CON._** This is the aftermath of the whole thing.

— jmb~ | January 27 2025 | 13:10

"Mizo.. mizo.. help.." Rika mumbles as Mizo comforts her in her own room, while she is laying on her bed, with a blanket over her. "It's okay, it's okay.. Rika.. I'm here." Mizo holds her hand as she tenses up. "Are you.. him?" She asks, as he nodded. "I'm him. Mizo. Mizo Ibasa." He smiles as Rika uses her weak body to snuggle up to Mizo. "I.. can't help.. but feel.. the need for you.. I hate it." Rika says weakly, as she grabs Mijo to herself.

"I just hope.. that.. you take away all my.. my hurt.. pleasee.. I'm so tired.." Rika says to him, as Mizo brushes her hair. "I'll make an exception tonight. We are **best friends,** but.. I think you **do** need some.. company." Mizo says as he kisses her forehead. "That's.. too far.. but.. I can't stop you.." added Rika, as she hugged Mizo tightly. "Then I'll stop." said Mizo as he accepted the hug.

"Thank you." She says before separating. "You didn't.. dress me, did you?" Rika asks, as Mizo nods and looks at her drawer. "I wasn't going to touch you without your consent. What did you think?" answered Mizo, as Rika blushed a bit and looked away. "Fuck.. yeah. Um, I just.. expected you.. nevermind. That was dumb of me to say, you're.. not.. that.. yeah. I'm getting it myself." Rika got out of her blanket, and Mizo quickly looked away. "Sis.. you're naked.." Mizo says, as Rika stood up and went to her drawer, while Mizo kept his gaze away.

"You're in my room. And, so..? You can get the fuck out maybe..?" She asks, her tone a bit playful but meaning. "Mhm. Understood." Mizo leaves the room. "Wait..! Where.. did my.. um.. other clothes go?" Rika asks as Mizo had already left. "Damn it." Rika looked back at her closet and got some comfy pajamas before following Mijo out. "Um, Mijo.. what.. um.. where did my previous.. you know.." Rika air quotes; 'those..' before continuing, "..clothes. Get me?"

Mijo answered as he showed the clothes, "Oh, here they are.. Unfortunately, I was too late to get them before the man tried to make it his.. by ripping it in a way that's overtly sexualized. Though, when I returned, he seemed to be gone and a policewoman was there and looked at me. She said like;" 

"Who are you?" asked the policewoman as Mizo stepped back. "I'm.. Mizo. Mizo Ibasa. Y—you know me, I met the police and told them I'm the victim's friend, named Rika Crusi. I told them.. that I was carrying her home and that she was mostly fine, aside from a few wounds. She is sound asleep, and she's at her home now. I'm here to retrieve her clothes.." answered Mizo, as the policewoman nodded. "Oh, yes. You're that Mizo kid. I found this." The policewoman gave him ripped clothes. "Oh, this is.." Mijo trails off, as the policewoman stood up and looked around. "The criminal's an escape convict.. He stole the clothes of the person in this room, since the person was out for the weekend. Don't worry about this now." The policewoman gave a thumbs up as Mizo left.

"Oh.. then I'd have to get new ones.." Rika says, as she looks at the ripped clothes. "Thanks for trying to get them back, at least." She says as she sighs and walks away to put them into her drawer. After she did, she went to see Mizo. 

"I.. I'm.. clean.. though." Rika thought out loud, as she sat next to Mizo. "Um, how did you.. uh.. get me clean from that.. that event, yeah.. I was wondering because.. you know, infection and disease stuff.. related to things like this.." Rika asked, as Mizo recalled what exactly happened after he got her and her clothes to her house. "Hmm.. Well, I figured a bath would be good so I gave you a warm bath by carrying you there, and letting you rest there for a while and letting you.. dry. Um, forgive me though, I had to look closely at your.. sensitive areas and give you multiple baths just to get you clean enough. After I wrapped you in a towel, and let you dry in it, I then placed you on the bed and waited." Mizo explains as Rika tilts her head in confusion.

"Wait.. so in those.. hours I never woke up? I don't remember any of that. Um, would you say I was.. conscious?" asked Rika as Mizo tilted his head to the left and right. "Kinda. But, I was focused on your body's health first. I remember you helping me move you around a bit, and.. when you tapped me on the shoulder when you were dry enough." explained Mizo as Rika nodded. "Ohhh.. figures. I don't remember.. but probably because I was just unconsciously helping you do stuff, while my mind was still blank.. I guess thanks for that too? Damn, that must've been a lot of work moving me around, haha.." Rika says, giving a light touch on Mizo's chin.

"Well what else? I don't know.." Rika says as she goes closer to Mizo. "Let's just move on for now...  Are you.. okay?" asked Mizo, as Rika nodded hesitantly. "Fine today.. I guess."  Rika starts to use her phone. "Then.. okay." Mizo looks at his phone too and starts using it.

"You know, you look.. like.." said Mizo as he looked at Rika eating a caramel ice cream with a big cone. "Huuh?" asked Rika, before Mizo smirked and shook his head. "Nevermind. It wouldn't make sense." continued Mizo, as Rika was about to retort but just decided to continue eating her ice cream. Mizo was waiting around for her to finish eating as they sat somewhere quite secluded in a super mall. Then Mizo decided to look around before suddenly Mizo straddled himself on Rika who was sitting still, as she gasped in surprise as the heat between them increased, but she didn't push him away.

"Mizo?! Um.. I'm not done—" said Rika before Mizo kissed her on the lips, she was initially surprised as Mizo dominated her mouth. She lets out an involuntary whimper as Mizo pulled back.. "I.. uh.. um.. Mizo, I.. just.. let me finish my— Mmmph~!" said Rika before Mizo kissed her again, as his hands navigate to her firm breasts covered by her shirt, undershirt and bra. "Nnngh.. Mizo.." Rika whispered as Mizo slightly pulled back, letting her breathe. "My... ice cream.." said Rika as she finally gets to finish her ice cream while Mizo starts moving a hand to her skirt.

"Eh.. Mizo.. I.. uh.. I'm not sure about.. any.. um.. more intimacy around the mall.." said Rika as her hands drift to his hands, one on her clothes breasts, and one on her inner thigh. "Oh..? Guess I was.. getting too immersed, I wouldn't want to have an audience, but.." said Mizo as he settled his to instead pull Rika into a hug, while kissing her. "Mizo..." repeated Rika before pulling back and stood up. "I understand, but here's the thing, what do... you want? As in, **IF** we have private time, what do you want from this whole.. uh.. intimacy? I'm not opposed to anything really, I just need to know." asked Mizo as he sits back nearby and Rika holds her arms with a slight blush.

"Ah.. I.. well.. I'm just not used to speaking about my sexual preferences to my.. best friend, much less a boy." said Rika, as she scratched her head. "What do you think?" asked Rika, as Mizo responded, "Um.. you definitely have a deranged and hidden sexual preference, otherwise.. why would something.. 'vanilla' ironically enough, would be weird to say to me?" Rika blushed intensely and shook her head. "Sh—shut up! It.. it's just.. It's not.. well, how about you start huh?! Feeling so confident.." asked Rika, as Mizo smirked.

"Oh? Then I like.. B.D.S.M..! Do I have to elaborate?" said Mijo, as Rika turned her head in a bit of shock as Mijo made his point clear as he patted her head while going closer to her face. "Nngh.. Ah! Stop.. stop.. I can't stop myself from... making sounds and shit.." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled and pulled back. "I don't think I need to know anyway, you seem the type to be very.. very.. **submissive** when in these situations like these, yes?" asked Mizo, as he made Rika look at his eyes, eliciting a slight shiver and strained whimpers from her. "I.. stop.. for a moment. Need to catch myself.." said Rika, as she felt super heated and her heart pounding. Mizo pulled back again as she held herself to steady the emotions mixing together.

"You know, maybe we should get the heat off already at your place, before you die haha." said Mizo, as Rika immediately starts blushing again. "Fine, fine.. I hate you so much.. for making me act this way. Let's just.. get it done, I.. hate being like this.." responded Rika, as Mizo hugged her while helping her back up. "Ahh~ N—no~ Just.. ah.." mumbled Rika, before  Mijo pulled back and they walked to her house, getting out of the super mall, the entire time, Rhida was very red while Mizo kept her vigilant with occasional kisses on the cheeks.

Once they finally went inside Rika's house, Mizo wasted no time helping Rika settle down, then when Rika was about to go into her bedroom, Mizo managed to bother her, and as she turned around, Mizo kissed her as he pushed her inside her room, then to her bed. He pulled back, as Rika was limp and heavily breathing. "M—Mizo... I didn't.. expect that.. but.. I'll let you.. manhandle me, just this.. time." commented Rika, as Mizo nodded and played with Rika's hair. "Are you happy.. dummy?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded and kissed her again.

"Mmmph.." mumbled Rhida as Mizo kissed her more intimately, going deep in her mouth. Rika melted into his kiss, accepting everything he's doing, but she gets a bit confused and needy when he eventually pulls back and looks at her all satisfied. "Huh..? Why.. did you stop?" asked Rika, as Mizo gently started to part her legs, revealing her pink shorts covering her inner parts. "Ah? T—there..?" said Rika, as Mizi started to slowly take off her pink shorts, to reveal the red damp panties that Mizo smiled and moved his hands to touch it. "Gosh.. this is really happening.. mmnn..." said Rika, before a small whimper escaped her lips as Mizo started rubbing.

"J—just be careful.. I..very.. hazy.. when.. aroused like this.." said Rika as Mizo looked at her with a clear face on clarification of what she said. "J—just.. y—you.. ah.. the.. whole.. experience.. the.. being aroused part.. Makes me dizzy.. D—don't worry though.. My body just acts that way.." explained Rika, as Mizo watched Rika's very red face and her panties as he took them off and prepared to go inside, Rika seems so pliant and limp in his hands, yet he wants to be delicate about it.

"I.. just gotta ask, because.. while I trust you're saying the truth.. Do you really want to.. do this whole thing, or are you just.. following my lead?" asked Mizo, as he stood up and looked directly at her face. "M—Mizo.." said Rika as she adjusted herself to a more comfortable position. "I.." Rika sighs and looks at herself. "I don't trust myself to not.. ruin this whole thing between us. I.. just.. I don't know If.. if.. I would accept myself just.. retreating inward." explained Rika, as Mijo laid beside her, looking at her with concern.

"Mizo.. it's not that I.. don't have the desire to.. but, I'm just so.. conflicted. I'd.. rather accept this.. whole dynamic between us, let you take the leading role. I'm.. I.. don't want to just.. say that I want.. this. What If I don't in the future? It's.. getting night.. All I want is.. comfort. Please, if.. there'd be anything I would say.. It's.. that I would respond. Always, if anything.. I trust you to be gentle with the tsundere girl with her own problems." continued Rika, before hugging Mizo. Both pulled back after a while, and Mizo asked, "So.. do you still have the 'mood'?"

"Yeah, I can see it in your face.. My.. speech made you lose your.. drive. Me too, and.. it sucks." answered Rika, laying her head on the wall behind her. "It's fine.. I'm not that horny, besides.. we're still best friends. We've gone through a lot without navigating this weird romance." responded Mijo, as he gently sat beside her as she put her head on his shoulder, slightly blushing. They were quiet, the electric fan buzzing through the stillness. She shifted a bit, tugging her shirt as she grabbed her shorts and wore them again.

"D—don't get any ideas though.. I'm getting used to.. this. I can retaliate." she mumbled, her voice half-sharp and half-soft. "I might get red.. but.. I'm not melting whenever you look at me all weird okay? Got that?!" Her cheek pressed on his shoulders, her voice getting louder. "Haha.. I'll keep it in mind. I'll just continue to be more surprising then. Ooh! Maybe.." said Mizo as he made Rika look at him with that grin.

Rika was confused, but before she could say anything, Mizo booped her nose and chuckled. "Hm? What were you thinking? Hehe.. Anyways, we got a bunch of stuff to do.. or..?" asked Mizo, as Rika narrowed her eyes and slapped him, gently. "Hah! Shush.. You're _baiting_ me.. You know my answer." answered Rika, as she hugged him to make him fall to her bed more, she is on top, while he's on the bottom. "Ohoh? Are you..?" said Mizo, as Rika had a slight blush before pulling him back up. "Nope. Stop thinking about it! I swear, you always think about sex.." responded Rika, with a smirk.

"Can't help it. A girl pushes me on _her_ bed and she's _on top_, blushing and smirking.. I'd be a bit of a stone head if I didn't see the implications." said Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Shut upp.. You started this.." responded Rika as Mizo got close to her face, just enough to not kiss her. "You're welcome." whispered Mizo, before pulling back. Rika shook her head slightly with a smirk as they lay together in her bed, resting.

"Hey.. can you.. uh.. come into my room..?" asked Rika, calling Mizo through her phone. "Hm? Why?" questioned Mizo, as Rika slightly blushed. "I.. need someone to talk about this.. okay...?" answered Rika, as Mizo replied, "Aight." then a few seconds later, someone knocked at Rika's door. "Come in.." said Rika, as Mizo went inside and sat beside her. "So.. what's gotten you so flustered? Usually, I'd see you like this if I—" asked Mizo, before Rika held his hand tightly. "Sh—shut.. up.. B—but.. I uh.. well.." stuttered Rika, as she took a deep breath and looked at Mizo.

"Wanna.. review some hentai with me?" asked Rika, as Mizo is slightly flustered and widened his eyes a bit. Quickly though, he smirks and looks at Rika in the eyes and answers, "Oh? Yes, but.. May I ask why?". Rika blushes more intensely, and looks away. "F—for fun. Please don't take it any other way, it's just been a rough few months for me.. B—besides, we get to 'learn' more about each other...!" blurted out Rika, as Mizo nodded and chuckled.

"Aight, if that's how you want to frame it. Though, before I let this go, can I just say that only high school couples that are VERY close with each other do this?" asked Mizo, as Rika held Mizo's shoulders and looked at him directly in the eyes, a bit irritated. "Sh—shut up..! I—I know that.. but.. we're.. different, okay? Best friends who trust each other with this stuff." said Rika, before pulling back.

"Mhm. I'm convinced~" said Mizo as he opened up his phone and opened up his favorite hentai website, on private mode of course. Rika does the same. "Who's going first? I have so many, but I want to.. ahem.. start with this one." said Mizo, as he shows her a certain comic about a character being.. raped and mind-broken by a particularly strong man after a decisive war. 

"W—what.. this.. is.. crazy.. you.. use this material?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded, feeling a bit vulnerable. "Mhm. Don't worry, it's all fantasy. But yeah, this is the.. summary of the many.. hentais I look at. Mainly the 'rape' tag, and the 'mind break/control' tag." explained Mizo, as Rika seems to be shaking for an unknown reason. "O—okay... I know, it's all just fantasy and shit, but.. I.. I've never seen you.. you know, be as.. uh.. let's say sex-crazed and coercive to do these to.. wait, do I see a... 'slave' tag?" responded Rika, as Mizo nodded, both of them fully horny now.

"Yeah, that's.. that's also part of it. Though I tend to leave it off, it's a reoccurring tag I click and.. enjoy to." explained Mizo, as Rika nodded slowly. "Mmmnn.. Those.. uh.. breakdowns. Shit, I'm.. yeah. This is.. very prone.. to..." said Rika, as she looked at the images a bit closer and felt the ache on her crotch intensify as she looked away. "Look, I don't want to know if you're horny or not, but I know you probably are... It's just.. so humiliating for the woman there.." said Rika, as she brushed her hair and shook her head to clear her thoughts.

"I think she's a great general in the canon right? This is technically a r34 version. She's.. being.. taken, by the enemy she defeated in the game.. It's just.. why.. do so many.. dynamics fall into this? I know her backstory was of a slave, but.. it seems that if.. like, a female who is strong and beautiful gets released, and they have a vaguely antagonistic relationship with someone, there pours in the various.. comics about dominating the girl. You know, I'm.. quite rebellious, if you can call it that.. So the whole.. whiplash is.. real." mused Rika, as Mizo thought about what she said.

"That.. is true. I agree. I've thought about it when writing and sometimes just looking at the most popular ones.. There's a trend. What about you though? I'm sure you got something equally.. surprising." said Mizo, as Rika nodded and showed him her selection. It's about two guys, one is a bully, but on the start, he turns into a girl, and basically was raped in the first instance, and well.. is sexually coerced eventually to become the bullied boy's girlfriend/fuck-buddy, constantly being sexually aroused by the boy and humiliated.

"Hm. I thought you would like lesbian or gay hentai more..?" asked Mizo, as Rika moves her head side to side as a 'maybe'. "Well.. they all do the same thing! Without specific looking and more... deep searches, most of the hentai is straight! See, even if I find one, it's like.. you're using a dick, why not just be a man and fuck thay way? I guess.. strap-ons but full large dicks..? Also, those.. scenes, like they're way too big to fit in any boxers, much less panties. T—that's why.. I've found.. well, as you can see.. These. Um, well.. I'm quite embarrassed now." explained Rika, as Mizo took a minute to look through the panels of the hentai.

"Rape.. gender change..? How.. quaint. Hmm.. Seems like we have about the same penchant for.. non-consenting acts, manifesting in different ways. I like more brutal ones, more rough. You tend to.. hm, this character, wouldn't you say she has.. a certain 'tsundere' to her when she gets turned to a girl?" asked Mizo, as Rika further blushed and nodded. "Mhm. Yeah, you tend to.. like.. people switching. Where, someone turns to another, like mine actually. Only difference is mine is more magical and forceful and yours is more coercive and hidden, am I correct, dear friend?" continued Mizo, as Rika nodded before burying her face in her pillows.

After Rika felt her confidence level up a bit, she went and took her phone from Mizo as they locked eyes. "I.. uh.. you know, I.. learned a lot from this exchange. Um, promise me.. You.. never will.. you know, do 'that'..?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded and held her other free hand. "I promise. Sometimes, it even gets.. disgusting sometimes y'know? So, while this.. is my kinks, I won't.. forsake anything for it. Not with you. Not anyone else." promised Mizo, as Rika nodded. 

"Y—yeah.. I'm just.. self-aware now of that girl getting coerced and dominated in the hentai. I.. as arousing as it is, I know I wouldn't actually like being raped, then sexually assaulted, then raped, continuously, until I 'enjoy' it. I'm just.. feeling so.. weird to you, you know? If we both like non-con stuff, what's stopping us from betraying each other..?" mused Rika, as Mizo reassured her, "We won't. I won't. I know you won't. Just... be aware of both of our boundaries I guess, though I'm more forward about testing that than you are to me."

"I—I know. Okay.. I just.. need some release. Um.. I don't know..! If I should fulfill it or not, it's just so.. embarrassing now, looking at the hentai again." said Rika, as she suddenly hugs Mizo, both horny, both incredibly aroused now by each other. "Rika! You'll.." said Mizo, as Rika mumbles, "I know.. I feel.. you. Just, don't do anything, just hug, okay?" Mizo nodded, embracing the hug, but Mizo's bulge is above her pussy, while her breasts strain from her shirt and his chest. 

Rika eventually pulls back, her face flushed, panting and looks away. "T—that's enough.. thanks for.. not doing anything." said Rika, as she grabbed her phone, still a bit shaky. Mizo smirked, shifting to ease his arousal. "Yeah. Glad I can help you with that.. Hey, at least no messes to clean up right?" teased Mizo, as he went closer, getting her attention. "You, red? Cute~" whispered Mizo, as Rika further blushes.

"Gah! Sh—shut up!" snapped Rika, as she threw the pillow nearby to his face. "I'm.. not.. hmph. Whatever. D—dumbass." continued Rika before she huffed as Mizo took the pillow and put it down on the bed. "Well, well... Looks like my tsundere is a bit red still? Hm, I'll let you go now, but.. hey, stay vigilant~!" responded Mizo before pulling out his phone and the room quiets down.

## Unfulfilled Desires

Moments in-between moments.

Rika is using her phone when someone enters her bedroom, she doesn't notice who it is until she is pushed to the wall by Mizo. "M—mizo?! Mmmnnn.." said Rika trying to push back, but Mizo got closer. "You'll be fucked like never before.. and by the end, bliss will overcome you, your desire.. very much fulfilled." whispered Mizo, before he kissed her deeply, making her squirm.

'Stopp... can't.. breathe.. Mizo.. please..'

Then when Mizo pulled back, Rika was looking at Mizo confused, and wanted them to chill for a moment. "Mizo..! St—" said Rika, before Mizo growled and tugged at her shirt before taking it off suddenly, exposing that she wasn't wearing a bra. "Hey hey don't.. nyaa~" said Rika, before Mizo started sucking on them and touching her intensely.

'W—what's happening.. why is he so intense?'

Rika's breath hitched as Mizo's lips touched her nipple, his hands roaming around her that sent jolts of arousal through her. "Mizo..!" she gasped, her words melting into soft and involuntary whimpering. She gasped again, as his mouth switched to her other nipple, while the cold air hit her other. Her hands tried to flail weakly against him, trying to push him away but.. she only pulled him closer, her mind a haze.

"Mizo.. mmnnn..!! AHH~!" Her words dissolved into a sharp cry as his fingers were inserted inside her, igniting a fire that raced through her veins. "Nnngh.. AHHH!!" Her body arched, a strangled moan escaping her lips as she hit the peak, all bliss, raw and consuming, filling her senses until everything was fading into a warm, heavy dark. She floated on the bed, as her heartbeat turned into a distant drum. The world almost softened, sinking her deeper into the dream, pulled by the quiet embrace.

_So.. good.. but.. I.. don't.. know.. if I should.._

"MIZO!" Riza shouted as she woke up from her dream, a quite wet dream. "What.. just happened?! Did I dream of this.. dummie, fucking me?! N—non consensual too.. Shit.." said Rika as she processed her surroundings. Mizo was beside her, peacefully sleeping, likely from the night before. They were in her bedroom, same bed, same room. She was clearly blushing and felt that ache in her crotch area. "Damn it, not that too.." Riza said before taking a pillow and holding it tightly, trying to calm herself from what just happened.

Rika's grip tightened, as she pressed it harder against her chest. She was trying desperately to smother away the heat and shame flowing through her body, but it seemed relentless. Her breathing was ragged, and uneven. Worse, she could feel the very humiliating dampness in-between her thighs, that makes things harder to calm down. "I hope to god Mizo is asleep.." mumbled Rika before shooting a glance at Mijo. He was still asleep, peaceful and normal.

"Stupid brain.. why.. am I so.. horny!" Rika muttered, her voice shaky. She shifted, pulling her knees closer as she groaned into the pillow. Her cheeks, still burning as she said, "Why.. him?! Why.. why am I having sexual fantasies.. with **that guy?!** Aww.." The dream fragments replayed again and again, a mix of disgust and shameful arousal started to appear. She shook her head furiously, trying to make the thoughts go away. "N—no way! That's not me. That isn't me! Gross.. disgusting.. Rika.. fuck you!" She tried to impulsively punish herself but she stopped when she felt Mizo stir and move.

"Please.. don't wake up.." she mumbled, as she looked at a Mizo who had an arm lazily slung over on the edge of the bed. 'Quite harmless..' she thinks to herself, a far cry from the dream Mizo. "Dummy.." she whispered softly, her grip loosening on her pillow as she went closer to Mizo. She looked at him for a while, as the electric fan buzzed and Rika felt her emotions calm down, almost like the gentleness took away her worries for a while.

"Eek!" Rika was startled when her phone buzzed and so quickly picked it up. "What.. oh? Someone.. liked my art on.. Mastodon? That's.. surprising. I never had much notifs there anyway, no wonder I didn't turn it off.. But.. unsurprisingly.. it's the.. NSFW one. Hays, even in the fediverse, horniness prevails." continued Rika, as Mizo stirred awake. Rika realized it was 6:00 and they both usually woke up together. "Rika..? You up?" asked Mizo, as he looked at her, blushing a bit as she looked at her phone.

Rika's head snapped towards him as she met his sleepy eyes. "Y—yeah..! I—I'm up!" said Rika, a bit too fast from normal. "What's got you red? What? Did you have a.. 'moment'?" teased Mizo, smirking as Rika looks away, knowing what Mizo is doing without even looking. "W—what do you mean? I—I just.. I was just looking at a post I made that someone liked." responded Rika, as Mizo chuckled and went closer, whispering. "I sure hope it's the cute ones, but.. I'm not surprised.." as he took her phone and looked at the post. "H—HEY! That's n—none of your business, dummy!" shouted Rika as she wrestled her phone away from him, feeling more embarrassed than before.

"Happy now..?" asked Rika and before Mizo could respond, she spoke up again. "Ugh. Whatever. Not a big deal, I'm fine. I'm.. I wanna sleep again.. it's still cold." Rika then put her phone back on the night stand nearby, as she laid on the bed comfortably. "Oh? Is the dream that good?" teased Mizo again, as Rika blushed and stuttered, "N—no! No.. yeah.. no.. I.. shut up! Just sleep already." Mizo went close and kissed her on the lips before also sleeping. Rika blushed but let him, as she closed her eyes, praying to god she doesn't get raped in the dream again.

_I sure hope.. mmnn.. what's this.. feeling..?_

"Ugh.. huh? Why am I only wearing this huge ahh shirt? This.. is down to my.. wait. Why am I only wearing a shirt..? My.. bottom.. completely.." said Rika, instantly blushing as she is only wearing an oversized blue shirt, the hem brushing her thigh. She had nothing else on.

"Rika~" said a female voice, though the tone sounded familiar. "Huh?! Who's there.. W—who are you!?" responded Rika to a woman, who is wearing clothes and acts like the Mizo she thinks of. "Mizo, of course.. How could you forget, dear Rika..?" asked Mizo before pinning her to the bed. "Mizo!" she shouted as she gasped due to the shirt riding up, the exposure making her squirm. She was flailing, trying to push back, but somehow Mizo's strength kept her pinned, the mattress sinking. It felt soft and warm, her heated self collapsing under immense arousal.

"Why so.. shy, dear?" murmured Mizo, her tone teasing, but laced with something darker and hungrier. "Thinking about your.. girlfriend, haven't you?" Her lips brushed Rika's neck, soft and deliberately, making Rika shudder. "N—no.. no.. I—I haven't, please. Mizo, let me go.. I.. can't take anymore of this.." Rika twisted beneath Mizo, but she tightened her grip. Mizo chuckled, low and sultry as she shifted to straddle Rika fully, her weight pushing Rika deeper into her bed. "You're so cute when you fight, my little tsundere~" said Mizo, releasing one wrist to trail her fingers down Rika's arm then to Rika's stomach, under the hem of Rika's shirt.

Rika's breath hitched as Mizo does her thing, teasingly light before deeping lower, to whwre she doesn't want to go to. "But.. my girlfriend, you.. look like you don't want to stop, hm?" asked Mizo before Rika immediately protested, "I do! I swear, I DO! Plea— Ahh.." She immediately cracked into a whimper as the fingers inserted inside her, the fire igniting something she can't process. Her body arched into the touch, the shameful involuntary response of herself that made her want to kill herself for letting anything happen.

"S—stop.. please..!" gasped Rika, but it felt weak and hollow, the haze creeping over her like a wave. Mizo's eyes locked onto Rika with intensity. "That's it.. Let go, dearie.." Her hand slid up, cupping Rika's face to force her to meet Mizo's gaze. "God.. Mizo.. I'm.. close.. help.. me.." pleaded Rika as Mizo worked her pleasure to overwhelm. Then the crash out, Rika was blinded, the raw shuddering release tearing her apart as she cried out and trembled underneath a Mizo she doesn't recognize.

_What.. what.. happened.._

Rina snapped awake, a ragged gasp clawing out of her throat. "Mizo..? Who am I even getting raped by anymore..?" asked Rika to herself, as she pressed both hands to her faxe, muffling a groan. "What's wrong with me..?" She darted to Mizo, his peaceful sleep a cruel contrast to whatever the fuck happened. "You're.. ruining me.. and fuck it, it's not your fault either.." she muttered, half pleading and half-irritated, before burying her face into her pillow again. She squeezed her eyes shut, praying for a non-sexual dream to happen. "Please.. I don't want to fuck or be fucked anymore.." murmured Rika before drifting off again.

## Numbing Sex

The first (yes, I wrote this last) chapter in the 'Rika is submissive and she's scared about it' series where she experiences more trauma! Anywho, this is the beginning, mainly because it fits starting darker so the lighter endings feel satisfying. Anyway, let's say, someone is affected by everything.

**_NON-CON DEPICTED. ABUSE. ALL TYPES._**

Rika is currently chilling at bed, playing a hack-n-slash mobile videogame. Something about Babylonia and Gray Ravens. As she was somewhat focused on playing, someone laid on her legs and she yelped as she looked at who it was. "Mizo?! Hey! Get off of my—" blurted out Rika before Mizo kissed her, making her drop her tablet, as she was easily overwhelmed by this sudden surprise. Mizo pulled back as Rika was blushing.

"M—Mizo?! G—get off.. please.." said Rika, as she felt weak by this closeness. She is trembling and her breath hitching. "Mmm.. Rika.." whispered Mizo, his eyes gleaming with dark intention, yet she felt it was hollow. "Mizo.. what are you doing.. just.. move.. and.. I... I'll forgive you.. just please.. get off of me.." pleaded Rika, as Mizo groaned but kept being on top of Rika.

Mizo pressed heavier on Rika's legs, making Rika squirm. "Nngh.. it hurts.. I.. don't want this.." whined Rika, trying to push Mizo off but he easily pins her wrists. "Nuh—uh. You're staying like this." whispered Mizo, his smile hollow yet wicked. He seems.. off, both in how unusually dominant he is, and how his eyes aren't lustful, almost like he's just following an instinct. "I'm scared.. y—you're not listening.. you could—" said Rika before cutting herself off, flinching.

"Scared..? Cute.." said Mizo as Rika shivered when his fingers traced lazily over her arm. "W—what's cute a—about that.." said Rika, further trembling as Mizo adjusted, holding onto her waist, making her gasp. Mizo went close to her lips as he whispered, "Listen.. just follow me.. and you'll forget about all the little problems.." said Mizo before he kissed Rika, making her moan involuntarily, her body weakly protesting.

Mizo pulled back, as Rika looked at him with flushed cheeks and wide, teary eyes. "Mizo.. I—I know we're.. not.. so.. close, because.. of stuff.. b—but.. I—I swear, y—you don't have to—" said Rika as she was cut off by her own squirm as Mizo stopped her from adjusting. "No." said Mizo firm, but almost like he's just reacting to Rika's resistance. "Is this.. scaring.. hurting.." muttered Mizo as he brushed over her breasts, lightly teasing her nipples beneath her bra and shirt.

"Both! I—It's both! Please. Listen to me. Listen as best friends.. Release me.." said Rika, her voice breaking. "Your.. body." Mizo laughs, like he's finding something amusing in this depraved situation. "Funny how that works. You can want something but don't feel it. But.." said Mizo before moving his hands to her crotch, teasing her shameful damp area there. "When your body craves, yet your mind says it's **all** wrong." Rika whimpers as he does this, struggling to think critically.

"I—I..!" Rika doesn't know what to say, what is he even talking about, she thinks. Then, she says, her voice softer and pleading again. "Mizo. If you care, stop.. I—I beg. I—I..." Rika trails off as Mizo looks at her tablet, the game AFK on the menu. "Begging.." Mizo then quickly pinned Rika when she was about to scoot back to the headboard, making her yelp.

"Mizo— Wha—?!!" exclaimed Rika as Mizo grabbed the hem of her shirt and brought it up, temporarily blinding her, then she felt her bra being taken off as suddenly her shirt was taken off and tossed aside. "Mizo!!" shouted Rika as she tried to fight back, adrenaline rushing before Mizo started touching and nipping her nipples, making her gasp and moan as he took off her glasses too, the blur only worsening the fact that she doesn't know who is the person on top of her.

Rika is rising in panic and is trying to move her arms and legs, but her arms are pinned, and.. "Mizo!! Wait don't—" said Rika, before Mizo pulled down her pants, with her damp panties, her shameful slick hairy pussy under full display. "Fuck you.." said Rika, trembling, half-angered yet half-aroused. "Oh..? Looks like you're not taking care of this little ol' thing. Don't worry, I'll.. I'll.. do something." said Mizo, he seems to be commenting, but is forcing himself to comment on it while not being in the mood to do so.

Rika's wrists ached, her legs trapped. "I.. I don't know why you're doing this.. Y—You don't even look like you want this!!" shouted Rika as Mizo lazily smirked, mechanically. "Want..? Do I want this?" commented Mizo as his fingers trailed down her stomach, pausing at the sensitive skin above her pubic hair. Rika squirmed and her thighs trembled, her cheeks blushing more.

"Wanting.. hey, your body's.. screaming, almost.. like.. begging. Such a shame, really." said Mizo, detached to Rika's confusion, humiliation and shame as he pressed a finger against her folds. Her body shuddered and her thighs twitched as she bit her lip to keep herself from whimpering.  "T—then do—ngh!—something about it!" shouted Rika, trembling with defiance yet the flush creeping up her neck wasn't letting go. 

Mizo's fingers circled around her clit, as the sparks made Rika's breathing hitch as he does so. "S—stop..! I.. don't want.. this.." she choked out, her tears prickling on the corner of her eyes. Mizo's fingers slipped inside her folds, she arched involuntarily as she let out a choked moan before clamping her lips shut. "Funny thing.. is there a difference?" mused Mizo before he curled his fingers inside her, hitting a spot that made her gasp and squirm.

He let go of her hands but before she could push him away, he spread her legs. Then he pressed his erection through his pants against her as her hands instantly fell on the bedsheets, gripping them tightly. Mizo pulled his fingers out the  he took off his pants mechanically. His erection was clear as Rika's heart sank and she immediately tried to kick him. 

Mizo caught her heel grazing his thigh, then pinned it to the bed. He positioned himself between her legs, his arousal obvious but his face blank. "Shh.. It'll all be over soon.. you'll.. _like it._" said Mizo, almost soothingly, though he seemed more like mocking than anything. He leaned forward as Rika managed to blurt out something as she was trying to survive, "Look at me.. please please... You're.. better than.. any of this. Please.. come back to us." said Rika, her voice soft but very desperate, tears spilling down her cheeks.

He shifted, positioning himself between her thighs, his erection pressing against her slick entrance. "W—wait—" panicked Rika, before he pushed forward, the head of his cock breaching her entrance. "N—no..!!" screamed Rika as she clawed at the bedsheets, her thighs twitching weakly to attempt to close. Tears now started fully streaming down, her body betraying her, slick and yielding despite her mind's resistance.

"Mizo..! I've never done this..! It—ah!— hurts.. stop.." she whimpered, her voice breaking. "Now you know. Besides, your body likes it." said Mizo, as his hand slid to her clit, circling it with precision that made her hips buck despite everything, a choked moan escaping Rika's lips. "It's.. _you_.. you're making me. like th—" Her words dissolved into a sob as Mizo thrust harder, the rhythm relentlessly pushing her mind to the limit. She gripped the sheets as her legs trembled.

Rika's voice was incomprehensible to herself and Mizo as the overwhelming sensations ruined her strength. Her hips twitched, meeting his thrusts, very much against her inner will. He thrust deeper, harder like he was fulfilling a mechanical urge. Rika's broken whimpers and Mizo's breath hitching because of the mechsnical act rang out.

Her tears soaked the pillow as her inevitable shameful climax approached. Rika's body convulsed, a strangled moan escaping her lips as she had an unwanted orgasm ripping her body apart. Mizo followed, his release spilling inside her as he continued pumping inside her. His body stilled for a moment, before pulling out. He immediately got his phone and said, "You'll be fine." before leaving Rika in her ruined and violated state.

Rika laid there, exhausted, ruined and scared. Her body felt foreign, not hers, marked by the violence that just happened. She pulled the sheets over herself, wanting to sleep the pain away as if it could be like that. As if she slept there, he wouldn't.. do it again. She buried those thoughts, her mind and body hurting too much to consider potentially being seen by Mizo, and it happening again. She fell asleep sobbing, curled up in a fetal position.

_Wide awake, now._

Rika woke up, sobbing as she looked at the ceiling on top of her. She quickly looked around and saw Mizo, also staring off into the ceiling like he just witnessed a.. huh. "M—mizo?" said Rika, fully prepared for a dismissal or anything that told her it was just a dream. "Yeah.." replied Mizo, defeated as he looked at her then looked away. "Tell me right now. Did we or did we not have sex? I—I know this is a weird and dumb question, but.. I.. just need to know." said Rika, stern.

"No. Thank god we didn't. Didn't know it would lead to rape." answered Mizo as Rika gasped and put her hands on her mouth. "Y—you had..?" asked Rika as Mizo interrupted her, "Yes.. I did rape you in a dream, which led to me killing myself while you stayed around for the whole thing, then you got my stuff, and was a traumatized rape survivor." admitted Mizo, as Rika wondered what the fuck led the two of them to have the same dream, just.. hers cut off. 

"W—wait.. really..?" asked Rika before adding, "Wait.. was I playing, Babylonia Ravens?" Mizo turned to her, almost weirded out before answering, "Yeah.. I did. Your account too.. wait a fucking minute.. Did we have..?" Mizo realized before immediately going, "I'm so sorry for that. I promise, promise.. I would never fuck you like that. I would never rape you no matter how tired I am, of you.. Or or.. I would never hurt someone because I'm hurting, okay?! And never while you were playing Babylonia, you can't pause that game while in battle!!" 

Rika processed it before saying, "Y—yeah.. I.. didn't think you would... But.. does this mean.. you.. uh.. technically raped me in your dreams, and I felt that?! I.. yeah.. I was also wondering if I ever finished.. uh.. the Babylonia level.." Mizo sadly sighed and nodded, "What the fuck.." he says as he looks at Rika concerned. "Ugh.." Rika laid down, processing. 

"I—I don't know why it keeps happening.. Maybe.. I'm just scared of you? Deep down, I don't trust you, and so make up every damn possible way you could ruin me? I don't know.. I.. fuck. I'm just so insecure about.. everything, Mizo.. I hate how I like being taken like a damn whore, I hate my parents for being such shit people, I hate myself for being so weak to stand up to them and I hate you for being so.. so.. strong. You don't collapse like me. I.. fucking will let you walk over me, fuck me over, just because you gave me happiness once. I hate thinking about it it's all so hypothetical but it eats out— fuck no! drains— agh!! It fucking destroys me, okay?! OKAY!!!" vented Rika, as she let out her anger at Mizo, before immediately apologizing, "S—sorry.." then laying down again as she went closer, almost contradicting her very words.

"I guess.. I can't.. leave you. No matter how.. fucked up it is.. Fuck me, I don't know how. I don't think you ever did anything bad.. I just.. keep expecting you to do so.. Every single tiny thing, I.. ugh. I know you're like.. a dom in bed or something, but.. it just twists in dreams.. For that, I'm so sorry, even if you don't think I should." continued Rika, more softly before crying herself to sleep, holding a pillow yet maintaining very close to Mizo. Mizo sighed and slept too, he wanted to put this behind for later, he was sleepy and tired too. "Goodnight." he says before closing his eyes.

## A Controlled Fire

### Author's Note:

Well.. let's see here.. **_Non-con.._** okay, that's.. usual, at this **fucking** point.. **_Abuse?!_** _Physical, mental_ and.. **_sexual abuse?!_** Holy..

Yeah, this one's experimental, to see if I can write them at their most extreme, their motivations intact, but something twisted. Say, what if a certain person stops trying to.. be a moral person? Or, someone breaks entirely, forcing _her_ to mold herself and hold herself together to an increasingly hostile world, and _him?_

"Wait, isn't that the—"

I know, I've done it before. I want to further develop this, to further understand the relationship and how it works. So, to do that, let's go to this scenario again, but.. well, it's not less horny, but more visceral, likely. Though, yes.. let me say again;

**_NON-CON TOPICS. ABUSE. ALL TYPES. SELF-HARM TOO MENTIONED_**

Edit: It.. didn't write the way I wanted it too.. But then I realized. This is the absolute limit. Of course, it'd turn horrible, it's just.. I'm not satisfied, with it. I guess. Imma.. take a different approach.

Edit 2: added a dream section, to salvage this draft, hopefully.

Rika is silently watching over the people at the super mall, as the school year is finally over. Then, _he_ appeared. "Hey.. Rika~" greeted Mizo, as she was pulled to look at him, she didn't know how to feel, he was.. **different**. In the bad way, that is. She doesn't know what to feel, and that's sca— "Mmmnn!" Rika tried to pull back, but she wasn't ready, not at all. Yet, Mizo didn't notice this and continued deeply before pulling back, smiling.

"Mizo.. I.. don't—" said Rika, as she is dragged by Mizo, to a restaurant. "Hm? You're hungry, right?" asked Mizo, as he started to order. Rika wanted to say something, **anything**.. but he was already ordering. "Mizo.. I—I was.. but, I want to—" said Rika, before she was pulled again, and she gasped. Rika tried pulling back, but she was held firm in her right arm. They sat at it, and 'chatted' as they waited;

"W—what did you order..?" asked Rika, she has given up on trying to get out of this situation. "Your favorite, _Siomai Chao Fan_, me? _Chicken Lauriat,_ of course." said Mizo, as Rika looked away, trying to think. 'I—I mean.. Y—yes, that's my favorite, but..' Her train of thought crashed suddenly as he cupped her chin, making her look and tense up. "What's wrong? Is it school stuff, family? Come on, you can always.. _rely_ on me." comforted Mizo, as Rika tried to speak, but he suddenly pulled away as the order arrived.

Rika quickly distracted herself with the food, munching on every fried rice and siomai she could eat, focusing on the dish and not the person right in front of her. As she was about to finish, Mizo commented, "Hey, Rika..? You're taking your time, y'know. I mean, I'm just wondering. What's so delicious about it?" Rika shook her head. "N—no! I—It's nothing, I swear. I just eat slow.. okay?" responded Rika, as Mizo brushed her hair, making her pull back in shock.

"H—hey! I'm trying to eat.." asked Rika, as she finished eating, and put the bowl down. "T—there.. Let's go." said Rika exasperated as they got out and continued walking. "Y—you paid for the entire thing, didn't you?" asked Rika, as Mizo smiled and went close to her ear. "Of course~ But, you don't have to pay it back, no.. this, is enough.." whispered Mizo, before biting the lobe of her ear, making her squirm before kissing her deeply, _again_. 

'Oh god oh god please whatever— whoever Mizo this is please stop stop.. fuck... no.. why.. I shouldn't I'm going to—'

Mizo pulls back, as Rika breaths hitched. "T—that.. w—wasn't warranted. At all. Stop it. I.. don't need this.." said Rika, as she looked at Mizo, his face unreadable as he continued walking with her. Her right hand was held tight by Mizo, and even though she wasn't really trying to pull away, she _wanted to._ She doesn't know what to feel again, if she is even good enough to be without Mizo. 

'Fuck.. I.. not again not again.. Stuck.. with.. you.. Why.. is this so.. confusing.. fuck.. help.'

Rika mostly looked down while they walked home, Mizo was yapping about something, but she didn't care. Or rather, she was distracted by how firm his grasp is, or the multiple.. _violations_ she's trying to process. Until they arrived at _his_ home.

'Right.. W—we stay away from my house because.. of _them._ Parents. Fuck me.. I—I have to either face _them_ and their **hellfire** or.. _him.._ Always Mizo.'

Rika is interrupted in her train of thought again, as Mizo has her pinned to the wall near the gate. "H—hey!! G—get away!" screamed Rika, as she tried pushing him away and well.. she did succeed. "W—what's wrong with you.. I—I wasn't paying attention.. L—Let me talk first, **dammit**!" continued Rika, as Mizo shrugged and dusted off his shirt. "Then talk, princess. You've been.. distracted, so I had to distract you back." said Mizo, as Rika started tearing up.

"D—don't you get it.. I.. don't.. want.. this weird romance thing you're trying to do. I—I don't know why you've been so pushy. A—and I am not even hiding anything! I—I.. y—you know _me._ Why—" ranted Rika, before Mizo hugged her tight as she tried to pull back. "Hey! Mizo—"  said Rika, as he kissed her deeply while teasing her crotch. 

'W—what the fuck!? Stop— who are you— what have you.. done.. to.. Mizo.. mmmnn.. fuck.. you, why are you exploiting my sexual vulnerability?! Nngh..'

Rika tensed up and used all her power to just.. push _him_ away. She can't. He has her right where he wants her to be. Mizo grabbed her as her mind was half-dazed by the forced arousal and half-panic trying to retreat from this blatant violation of any semblance of symbolic boundary the two have.

Mizo pushed Rika to bed, as Mizo tugged down her pants. "Hey hey—" Rika was silenced when she was immediately choked by Mizo. Rika tried to stop him, as his intentions were clear.

**_Use her, and if not compliant? Break. Her._**

"M— Mizo— stop—" Mizo pulled back as Rika tried to breathe. "Please.. I.. I.. won't.. do anything.. I just.. want.. I can't.." blurted out Rika, it was very unclear to Rika, but instinctively she knew he was exploiting her **defeatist submissive mindset** that she had been trying to stop doing but can be exploited if she's been sufficiently made volatile.

Rika didn't know what else to say, but as she tried to think, her shift was lifted up and the bra removed. "Mizo!!" shouted Rika hoarsely as she tried to stop him by using her hands to hold his, but then she got pinned to the bed. Mizo dove in, as Rika tried to make it uncomfortable for her and him, but her knees buckled, her nipples pebbled..

'Fuck.. don't... ahh.. Mizo.. is this—'

**_Blank._**

Rika wasn't sure what happened next, all she knew was.. she awoke to Mizo, still inside her, and clearly.. there had been.. discharge. At this point, she should care. She should call the police. Heck, fuck it. Call her parents, and risk imprisonment at her own home just so that she can't meet Mizo if this is what he does. If that even is him.

**_No thought, empty head, only obey._**

Rika stared into the calendar, it had been months since she had any conscious thought. She remembered fragments of what Mizo told her;

"Your parents? Yeah, I told them we got accepted to a new school. I did. You didn't. You're staying here, and I put myself here."

"Haha.. sometimes I wonder how I dealt with your mess.. Luckily, I found a way. To make you mine. No more conflict, just us."

"And oh boy, you didn't tell me you were a freak~ Always fucking so desperate and clingy, I like it.. You'd have objected, but.. now you know your place."

"Thing is, it's not that your parents were wrong about you, but.. you were wrong about yourself and me. So, this is why we're together~"

"Children? Haha~ Who needs them? I have you. No children, from sex. I keep you without that bothersome uterus, and now.. we can have all fun, every day.."

These statements didn't make sense. Well.. at least for her current mindset. She probably would've escaped by herself into somewhere if she was aware of this abuse. Honestly? If there's something Rika still knows is that.. she'll be discarded eventually. They'll grow old.. and his desires never met. He's too possessive to not kill her once she is old enough to not be 'beautiful'. Probably. Everything is hazy anyway.

"Rika.. let's go." said Mizo before dragging her to be dressed.

_Dreams and reality blur like memories from the distant past.._

Rika wakes up tear-streaked, breath hitching as  she curled up into a fetal position, holding a pillow scared. Rika then immediately looked around her, no Mizo in sight. "Mizo..?" said Rika as she looked everywhere. "MIZO!! Where are you?!" screamed Rika as she looked around more frantically, before bumping into Mizo.

"What is it..?" asked Mizo, as Rika jumped up and unintentionally hit herself on the bed, making her fall back. "I don't know.. Who are you, Mizo? Why do you.." muttered Rika as she starts crying. "Fuck Fuck Fuck!!" said Rika as she shrieked when Mizo tried to get closer. "I don't know.. I can't.. fucking... trust, just.. I hate everything.." said Rika, as she groaned. 

Rika went silent as she stares off, breath hitching. Then Mizo suddenly sat beside her. "Mizo! Get the fuck ou— ugh.." Rika scratches her head intensely then ruffled her already tangled hair before wiping away her tears. "Ugh.. I don't know why I don't trust you.. I want to but.." said Rika as Mizo went closer again, but Rika further pulled back, hitting the wall beside the bed.  "Ah.. I.. ah.. You know.. I *feel* very trapped right now. Yet, I just want.. security? Do I feel that with you? I.. it.. tends to.. differ. I hate that. I hate just.. feeling insecure.. and I didn't see how.. you can hurt too.. until.. " trailed off Rika, as Mizo sadly nods. 

"Okay.. I'll.. say something. So, let me start, w—why did you.. what's the problem this time..? I thought it was school, then family, then me? It keeps getting more personal, and I just want you to be happy, content.. it'd be better with me, but I can leave.. Anytime. If you need it." said Mizo, as he analytically analysed the situation. "Ugh.. tch.. Mizo.. I just want to.. exist with you properly? I.. swear, I just.. I hate myself for not being good enough but.. clearly, I started hating you because hating myself was getting too much.. You.. don't allow me to cut myself.. soo.. I have to.. have someone to focus on.. I'm sorry.. I'm so sorry.. I know anything you could say.. I understand.. every.. thing you say, I.. just can't **apply** it." answered Rika, before reflecting more.

"Uh.. how do I put this.. it's so hard to talk your feelings, Mizo.. how do you write it as your hobby..?" Rika sighs, then looked at Mizo's eyes. "I.. uh.. I'm afraid that you'll.. become so detached that.. you'll forget about me.. I just really hate being attached to you and.. all this thinking about.. what if. what if.. you changed, I couldn't stop you. I have no agency. I just know.. no matter what.. damned thing will happen, I'll stay here. Whether you go insane or not..? I hope to god you don't." explained Rika, as Mizo sighed and nodded in acknowledgement. 

"I haven't been fair to you huh? Look, I.. don't mean to ignore you, berate you or even.. hurt you with words sometimes, it's just how we work right? Constant, push-and-pull.. But.. I get tired. I get.. irritated. I am not perfect. I will definitely make some dumb mistake, maybe.. but.. I just.. want you to understand, if I truly love you, both as a friend and this weird romance thing, I do not want you to suffer because of me. I.. thought, that.. by ignoring you, it'll fix whatever problems appear, no.. It doesn't. I know it doesn't, yet.. I do it because, I know how.. fragile you are, volatile, tsundere.. all that fun very intense stuff.. You don't know much about how I went through because I didn't want you to know. And, the only reason we now are.. well.. somewhat.. living together, is because of vacation. We never done this before. So, everything's new. I guess, I.. hid myself in the protective 'good' boyfriend mask, way too much for you. Am I right for saying that, if I was this.. apathetic from the beginning, you would leave me?" said Mizo, as Rika gasped and impulsively hugged Mizo.

Rika tried to say something, but incomprehensible mumbles came as she cried more. "I..! Mizo.." exclaimed Rika, before pulling back. "Maybe..? But that's besides the point. I don't think you're hiding. Or.. faking really, I just.. focused on myself, y'know? But.. yeah, yeah.. We never did this I guess, I was forced to.. since of **that** dream.. Did I tell you.. it was about how you *fucking* raped me to submission? You'd think it's a hentai doujin plot but.. no, it's.. no, probably is.. I just projected to our relationship.. Y—you get the relation, right?" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Again, I'd never do that, but.." said Mizo before winking, making Rika look away, blushing faintly. "Shut up! You can't make jokes about that! Not y—yet! But.. seriously, I just need more of you talking to me about **your** feelings. Finally." said Rika, before Mizo smiled and nudged Rika to her thigh.

"Mm! Oi!" Rika immediately looks at Mizo, before Mizo closed in into Rika's mouth. Though, Rika as soon as she saw Mizo getting close, tackled Mizo to the mattress, she's on top. "Hey! I'm the one that's kissing you okay! You don't get to.. uh.. uh.. force me! I wasn't— Hey!" said Rika, before Mizo grabbed her waist and grabbed her, making her stumble below Mizo, now on top. "Hey.. Mizo.. this is.. uh.. rape! Yeah!" said Rika, half-joking but also half-thrilled. "Rape..? Hey, I'm not doing anything, I'll leave if you don't want to, I was doing something anyway..?" responded Mizo, before Rika interrupted, "I was.. joking? Force of habit, sorry.. So like.. what are you doing on top of me? You know, this position doesn't scream 'I have work to do!' and more like 'Wifey~ I'm in heat right now..' What..? D—did you get fucking turned on by rape or something?!"

Mizo pulled back, as Rika scrambled to lean up. "Well.. uh.. technically, con non con exists, so.. uh.. if I say yes, would you say I'm bad?" asked Mizo, as Rika mocked gasped. "Of course! A poor woman like me gets exploited by you every single da—" said Rika, putting her palm on her head, looking distressed exaggeratedly. Then, Mizo went in for a kiss, but Rika, the ever-vigilant now, tackled Mizo and kissed him. Both stayed on each other before Rika pulled back. "There! You happy? Go back to writing nerd." said Rika, as Mizo got out of Rika's hold. "I will, I will. I.. just remember to not crash out while I'm note here, alright?" said Mizo, before leaving his bedroom. As Rika stared at the door, groaning. "Great. Now I have to act all.. eh. Fuck it. If he can't handle me at my worst then he don't— wait he did.. huh." murmured Rika to herself before deciding to shower to clear her mind off of the.. 'dream' or worst case disaster nightmare scenario.

"Mmmnn.. 'nother day.." mumbled Rika, as she woke up and stretched her arms. "Ugh.. it's.. so.. mmnn!!" muttered Rika before being pushed into bed, kissed by someone. Rika thinks to herself, 'H—Hey, w—who is th—' Rika cut herself off with a whimper, when her pussy was rubbed. "H—hey.." said Rika, as she tried to focus on who was on top of her.

Rika's heart raced as she squirmed beneath the insurmountable weight pinning her to the bed. The kisses deepened as Rika is hit by a familiar scent, that damn stupid cologne Mizo always used for some reason. "M—Mizo..?" mumbled Rika, her voice trembling. She focused on his eyes, dark with desire and his breath on her neck. "Mhm.. it's me.." murmured Mizo, as he teased the hem of her pajamas.

"W—why..?" asked Rika before she gasped as her pajamas were pulled down, revealing her panties. "Mizo..!" she gasped out, as Mizo's hands moved to hold Rika's thighs open. "Mizo.. what.. hey.." blurted out Rika, as her thighs instinctively buckled. 

Rika's breath hitched as Mizo's fingers traced her panties, the touch oscillating between light and possessive. "M—Mizo.. w—what's goi—" she stammered before she cut herself off with a whimper as a budding warmth built. Her thighs trembled, but his hands remained there, the restriction being a catalyst. "Shh.." murmured Mizo, leaning down to her earlobe before nipping it sharply making her gasp. "You're cute, y'know? Especially when you're like this.. soft, pliant, and.. _squirming.._" Supposedly gentle words, but his grasp into her thighs revealed another side much more **rough.**

Mizo tugged her panties down, as the cool air hitting her skin makes her whimper again. "W—wait! I—I'm not rea.. I—I just woke up..!" she protested weakly, but it quickly dissolved into a soft involuntary moan as Mizo's fingers slid between her folds. The slow deliberate strokes stirring up more heat she didn't want to have right there. 'It feels.. good.. but.. Mizo.. please.. stop..' Rika thinks to herself, the submissiveness inherent making her conflicted mind dazed. It felt like a warm blanket on a cold rainy afternoon, which only made her more dazed.

"Hm? Look at yourself.." Mizo growled, his voice roughening. He pressed his outline of his hard arousal against her thigh, grinding it like he's desperate. "So.. _wet,_ Rika." His fingers moved faster, then slower, coaxing a shaky cry from Rika. "Tell me.. you want.. no. _need_ this." he whispered, his lips hovering over hers. Rika's cheeks burned, "I.. I don't.. I.. Give me time.. plea—" she cut herself off when Mizo pushed her shirt up, exposing her breasts. "Mi—"

He cupped one, his thumb brushing the nipple as she arched into him involuntarily, a needy sound escaping her mouth. 'God.. please.. anyone.. stop.. whatever.. I'm.. feeling.. or _him_..' she thought to herself, the haze fogging her hesitations and doubts, as it made her crave how _he_ took control. "Don't lie~" Mizo said sharpy but also strangely soft. He pinched her nipple, then caressed it making her yelp. "This is enough.." He then shifted, his knee nudging her legs further apart as he positioned himself between them.

"Mizo..! Please just.." mumbled Rika, her haze making unsure of what she was trying to do. 'Submit? Assert?' she can't tell. Mizo immediately kissed her though soon after, his hands roaming her body, mixed reverence and greed. Then, he pressed himself against her entrance, teasing the poor girl again. "Just.. let me take care.. okay?" Mizo said, directly looking at the glazed over eyes of Rika.

Rika tried opening her mouth then closed it as Mizo leaned closer to her face. "Rika?" Mizo then kissed Rika deeply, at this point her mind was exhausted, and so, sealing her fate, she finally embraced this strange warm arousal, with a moan into the kiss.

## Awakened Exhausts

### Author's Note:

Honest talk, also, a more reflective chapter after greasing my rusty smut writing skills with the first one. Also, yes, it's up to you, whether this whole thing is canon, but I'll only say that anything related to sex is strictly restricted here, no matter what topic. Anyways, enjoy~!

**_WARNING: SEXUAL. DUH. NON-CON DISCUSSION_**

"AHHH!!!" Rika screamed as she awoke from another.. sexual dream, as Mizo stirred awake. "Hm? Why?" asked Mizo, as he looked at Rika, blushing and heavily breathing. "I— Fuck... Mizo!!" exclaimed Mizo as he held the collar of  his shirt. "What? What's the dream about huh? Is it like fucking.. like yeah.. fucking?" asked Mizo, as Rika tensed as she looked at his eyes. "I.. ugh.. you'll just.. yeah.." answered Rika, defeated as she slumped back to laying on the bed.

"Mmm.. So what brand is it?" asked Mizo as his body went up to look at Rika staring off onto the ceiling. "W—Wha— What?! I.. it's.. like.. you.. I guess. and.. me.." said Rika, stopping as she looked at a smirking Mizo. "Hey!" Rika's body goes up as she goes closer to Mizo's face. "Woah~ Early morning kiss? Guess you must've experienced a **very** _interesting_ drea—" commented Mizo, before Rika grabbed a pillow and used it to smack Mizo away slightly.

"Stop..! Fuck.. I can't talk about it when you're not serious! Ugh.." said Rika, as Mizo's face softened. "Go ahead." responded Mizo as Rika sighed and brushed her hair. "So.. I thought in the dream, I woke up before you showed up, being all pushy a—and intense.. I.. I.. just.. had a very.. 'primal' reaction.. to the **sex** that was happening." said Rika more softly as Mizo tilted his head slightly forward and raised his eyebrows. "Hm? Really.. then, what's the ending of this dream, why'd you.. scream?" analyzed Mizo, a more serious tone.

"I.. it's just.. I.. succumbed to it, y'know? Like.. I could've, should've stopped.. well.. yeah.. I.. just don't like.. being.." trailed off Rika, as Mizo went closer. "Hey.. you.. good or something?" asked Mizo, as he held her hand. "I.. no..? I don't know.. that.. I don't know if I should.. it's just.. it's all so wrong.. but there's the— you know.. like, desire to, even if I don't want to." continued Rika, sighing as she shakes her head to calm herself again.

"I.. well.. it's just your brain doing weird stuff.." said Mizo, as he also started brushing her hair. Rika blushed, as she looked at Mizo. "I.. I know, I guess. I just.. don't think about it a lot, so I'm dragged into endless dreams of.. desires I haven't.. ugh.." Rika held Mizo's hands on her hair and her other hand as she prepared to say something. "Hey.. just curious.. have you thought, of.. like.. sex. Towards me? N—not asking for anything to be done!! I.. just want to know if you're also.. wrestling with.. sexual thoughts?" asked Rika, as Mizo looked at her with wide eyes, blushing slightly.

"I.. well.. I'd be lying if I said 'No'." said Mizo, as Rika gasped in a mock surprise. "Oh really~ Well, now look who's talking?" said Rika, as Mizo slightly grinned. "Pot calling the kettle black?" responded Mizo, as he moved closer, intentionally hovering his lips over hers. Rika opened her mouth to speak before Mizo kissed her. The two locked in, before both pulled back.

"Tch.. You.. baited me for a kiss, huh?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "Well.. now I seem desperate.." replied Mizo, as Rika used her hand to wipe her mouth, then looked at Mizo. "You haven't elaborated. I.. told my disgusting horny dream.. You gotta have something, right?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "It's really simple. Literally imagine that.. dream of yours, but my perspective." Mizo admits, before immediately adding, "O—Of course, this is simply a visualization.."

"What..? What visualization?" asked Rika, as Mizo continued, "Basically.. uh.. it's like.. an estimation. Like, yeah. I.. fuck." Rika replied, "Wait wait, shut up.. So.. It's like.." Rika thought about it for a minute before suddenly blurting out, "You imagine fucking me, in all my damn places.. And you can't tell it like it is?" Mizo froze up and awkwardly smiled. "Yeah.. What? I just think.. it's a bit weird coming out of my mouth, that's it." said Mizo, as Rika sighed.

"Well.. I suppose.. it's better to.. be the.. 'victim' in this story than the perpetrator, I guess..?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded. "Mhm. Kinda. What I mean is, it's.. more I think, 'weird' and 'unethical' if I'm the one.. well, it just applies to anyone that's able to.. _you know._  While, for.. you, it's something that won't happen unless you are stuck with someone who would do such a thing.. Though, I guess my impression still exudes that, huh?" explained Mizo, as Rika looks away. "M—Maybe?? Don't look into it.. Me and my horny brain are completely separate. You just happen to be.. uh.. protective enough to where I can see it happen, in very horny twists." responded Rika, as Mizo shifted and brushed Rika's hair again.

"Oh? An admission.. Well, same with me. Maybe.. Just maybe.. I've been focusing when you're.. vulnerable to me, where I almost.. have total control, and that carries over to horny mode." said Mizo, as Rika stretched her arms. "Well well.. Now I wonder whenever my next mental breakdown comes in, you'll use my insecurity to get sex?" said Rika, in a playful mocking way. "Hah. You think so low of me, Rika~" Mizo went closer, as Rika instinctively leaned back. "When you've been stuck with someone for years, you learn a few things.." said Rika before they kissed on the lips before pulling back.

"Aight. Shoo. I need to get out and go to the CR. You don't bleed out monthly like I do." said Rika, before getting out as Mizo pulled back. "Mhm.. Would you like some chocolate then?" asked Mizo, as Rika immediately replied, "Hey! I haven't said anything.. Just.. give me some when I need one, I'll even.. _beg_ if you prefer, **weirdo.**" before grabbing her hygiene stuff then entering the bathroom. "Man.. this was.. interesting. I better go and organize the currently very rumpled bed. Then.. other housework, I guess." muttered Mizo before doing it.

## Coffin of Desire

### Author's Note:

So.. you seen the above, right? Let's.. try again, basically. Imma see how this can be done without being targeted to specifically sex. Thing is, I think I focused too much on the 'dominant' aspect of Mizo, and.. well, while that is an aspect, I felt it deserved more buildup or basically more reflection. 

**_NON-CON 'DISCUSSION'. BUT MOSTLY CON 'NON-CON'_**

Yes. We're back there again.

Rika entered Mizo's room as she was surprised by a Mizo.. quite interested in his phone, while being under a blanket that hid something on his crotch. "Ahem. Mizo. You have _me_ over. And you didn't lock the door. Why are you.. doing whatever this is..?" asked Rika, as Mizo was surprised and quickly fixed himself as Rika looked away in embarrassment. "Oh. I didn't expect you to arrive so early." said Mizo, as he looked at her eyes, trying very clearly to not look.

"Yeah yeah shut up." said Rika as she sighed. "Anyways.. On a related note.." continued Rika, as she went closer to Mizo. "I.. don't really know how to say it, but.. I'm feeling.. heated. Probably too much Mastodon. My feed's full of so-called 'tasteful' art. So.." said Rika, as Mizo hovered over her lips. "Mmnn.. stop.. I.. wasn't asking.. but.. yeah.. m—maybe just.. touch..? N—no.. uh.. insertion. How does that sound?" whispered to Rika, as Mizo stepped back and gave a thumbs up.

"Sure. You're the one telling me you're horny and expect me to know what exact type of sexual satisfaction you—" said Mizo, as Rika squeaked. "Shut up..! I.. said it. I'm.. so.. embarassed.. let's just.. start?" asked Rika, as they sat down. "Why do you act like you haven't been naked before? You do know you're—" said Mizo, as Rika was taking off her clothes methodically. "H—hey! Shut up. I didn't know, that when having sex, **someone** has to comment. W—we.. haven't fucked, right? Like.. n—not together, I mean you? Who knows?" asked Rika, as Mizo chuckled.

"Nope. Saving for you, speaking of which.." said Mizo, as he fully got all of his clothes off. "Look at that." said Mizo, pointing to his.. dick. "What..? It's nothing special, Mizo. It's like.. boasting about my boobs or something. It's weird." said Rika, as she got her clothes off fully too. "Well.. outside the bedroom, yes. But.. come on, Rika.. We're trying to make each other hard and wet, respectively. So, boasting and basically lying is a way to increase sexual desires." explained Mizo, as Rika instinctively flinched.

"I.. guess..? It's.. weird still. I.. know what you mean though. I just.." said Rika, as Mizo smiled. "What? Do you need to be degraded? My _slutty princess?"_ asked Mizo playfully, as Rika blushed. "Ah.. fuck you, I shouldn't have told you about.. wait.. fuck, then.. we fit huh? L—like.. you.. 'dominate' me.. or something, and I respond making you increase your hedonistic desires." realized Rika, as Mizo went closer.

"Guess I rubbed off on you huh?" said Mizo, as he starts rubbing the tip of his dick in her inner thigh. "In more ways than one~" continued Mizo, as Rika was clearly affected, her knees buckling and nipples pebbling. "H—how are you able to come up with these while horny?!" commented Rika as she looks at his lips.

"It's easy, you just gotta look at your partner, confidently while acknowledging who they are as a person. The rest will naturally follow, like.." said Mizo as he started pinching her nipples on her breasts. "Ah! Okay.. I.. should I be worried by this..?" asked Rika, as Mizo went closer and closer to her.. actual vagina. "What..? Like.. pregnancy?" asked Mizo, as Rika gasped as she heated up even more. "N—no?! M—maybe?! Mmmnn.. just don't surprise me by inserting anything, okay..? Can't think.. unlike you apparently.." answered Rika, as Mizo is now rubbing on her vulva.

"Ah! Fuck you.. how do you know this?!" asked Rika, as she is increasingly close to the climax. "A writer reads a lot of material.. and researches often.. you saw me, Rika.. By the way, I notice we're.. 'syncing..' Keep going, and let me.. handle it~!" explained Mizo, as he slowly but surely got both of them straight to the final breaking point. "Mizo!" shouted Rika as she climaxed as Mizo smirked, pulled back and also did, the discharge landing on her abdomen.

"Mmnn.." mumbled Rika as her daze temporarily left her breathing as she looked below, seeing the damp sheets and discharge scattered along her inner thighs and lower abdomen. "Happy? You had sex without having sex. Wasn't that cathartic?" asked Mizo, as Rika's brain suddenly jumped up to respond, "W—what.. how are you.. so calm.. Did you goon so much you don't even feel satisfied or something..?" answered Rika, as Mizo chuckled and got out of bed as he got some soft cotton towel.

"Of course I do.. It's.. just easy for me to respond. What? You don't goon too? Wait, no you of course do. You just haven't seen the male perspective huh? So focused on that entrance~?" explained Mizo, as he went closer to her face. "Let's just clean up.. or actually you do. I'm cleaning up myself. Apparently, the woman has to because she's the recipient.." said Rika, as she went to the bathroom and took a shower. 

"Hey, technically this means this sheet is our first actual sex, congrats Rika, you have a baby!" teased Mizo, as he audibly heard Rika groan but not respond, likely busy contemplating her horny life choices. "If there's another towel.. we probably should've used that. getting it all over my bed? More fabric to worry about.."  continued Mizo, as he got the sheet off then went to replace it as Rika got out of Mizo's bathroom and quietly got her clothes back.

Before Rika could contemplate whether to stay and risk Mizo seeing her again, or run to anywhere but here, Mizo arrived back, making her jolt and surprised. "Ah! H—Hey! Tch.." blurted out Rika, as Mizo chuckled as he replaced his bed. Somehow, her observation made her more.. interested. "Fuck this.. I'm going to get horny if I watch you." murmured Rika ashamedly before rushing to the bathroom. Mizo heard that but kept quiet as he felt it wasn't necessary.

_Later, when Rika accepted she just begged Mizo to fuck her during a lapse in judgment.._

"Hey, Mizo." said Rika, as she slumped over on Mizo's couch. "Hm? Done reflecting on the best sex you had in your life?" asked Mizo, sarcastically. "W—what?! That wasn't even sex dumbass. A—and I didn't want it to be anyway.  It was more of a weird way.. of.. whatever sexual act that was.. A—anyways, shut up for a minute, let me cook." responded Rika as she glared at Mizo playfully as he kept silent on whatever comeback he had on his mind. 

"So...I thought about it.. and I want to revisit what we.. uh.. discussed.. so.. j—just a hypothetical.. NOT ASKING— but.. what if.. we got into.. a heated moment, right? Then.. you.. pinned me down.. and.. inser—" said Rika, before Mizo kissed the already blushing Rika, as Rika was initially surprised but then reciprocated as she pushed him to his back on the sofa. Rika pulls back, as Mizo smiles. "Now now.. where did this sudden burst of horniness come from?" asked Mizo, as Rika pushed herself off Mizo. 

"I.. I'm just asking. I.. wonder.. how'd you feel, I guess. A—after all.. if we're going to continue to have this weird fuckin' somewhat sexual relationship, might as well..  y'know." explained Rika, as Mizo pondered before shrugging. "What'd you want me to say? You know me, I know you.. So, I'd say I like every single sound coming out of that mouth of yours as I ruin you.." whispered Mizo to Rika, making her shiver.

"Okay, okay.. I get it. You'd be the stereotypical 'dominant' man and I'd be the submissive woman. As per sexual standards." said Rika, as Mizo pulled back and shrugged again. "That's your call. Again, I don't _really_ care either way, it _all_ focuses on you, love~" said Mizo, as she booped her nose and pulled back. "Ah.. well.. fuck it. Let's move on now." said Rika, as she brushed her hair and shook her head to clear the lingering heat.
