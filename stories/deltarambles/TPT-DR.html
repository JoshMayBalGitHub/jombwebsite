# DeltaRambles: The Paper Trail

Author Note: I mean, i had to do it, as GASTER said "What this entity desires is to finish the story, so desperate for an ending that deprived of one, they will make one themselves, such a nature cant be stopped". Well i prove to you that then.

Summary: The Player might not be here anymore but the story continues... Kris, Noelle and Susie talk to Asriel.

*CONNECTION SEVERED*

Kris after years of being controlled is finally free! Free to do whatever they please. But why would they disconnect after so long? It must've something to do with that knight that they see everytime they die since they look like they were speaking to the soul not them but as they thought about it-

"Mom! Kris! I'm home!" A voice echoed downstairs and... it was Asriel! They needed to tell him about all of the dark worlds before something bad happens.

Kris rushes out of their bedroom and quickly goes downstairs.

Toriel said excitedly, "Asriel, my dear, how has been college?"

Asriel said "Oh, mom it has been great! Where's Kris- Oh."

Kris has been watching the two near the telephone and hasn't said anything.
