##  Thy Night

## Author's Note:

I don't know if this is related but, it gotta be here because it's something I'm explorin'

By the way, the perspective, it's from a character's viewpoint. Not me.

"You know, I never understand the appeal of tight clothes.. I mean, they're just so uncomfortable to wear y'know.. And and besides, if you're going outside, best bet you'll be freezing or melting depending on time of year..! Worst part is, they often show everything your body's gotta offer, and you know, I'm not as.. uh.. pretty as other girls, you get me.. Those girls that somehow stay thin during high school even with all the stress..! When I'm in my baggy and large shirts and pants because of my height.. and ugh.. weight, I think somehow it just.. well I don't think about it but you know, especially during that school party we had, I had an all dark blue pants, polo, fedora hat and blue sling bag! But when I saw the other girls, dresses, purses.. Yeah, that's why I was so focused at drinking the soft drinks they sold.. Gets?"

I said, "Yeah, but I don't see how that'll affect your enjoyment. I.. uh.. was busy with others, so I only saw you occasionally buying and drinking cold soft drinks, looking off to wherever happened to be interesting.. You even messaged to me about reading that book you got in your exchange gift while the stage was speaking about something, you said you got bored after a while but didn't want to waste anything so uh.. you drank.. like last time."

"Mhm. I.. ugh. Just, look.. Even if you know, what I know.. Sitting together on that night seemed icky to me. You, boy, and me, girl.. Even if we're supposedly only best friends and are sibling-like.. I'm.. just saying..! Hey, you didn't tell me what you did by the way... This is the first convo we're having since you blacked out on my messages.."

I responded with; "What..? I.. just said.. that I was pretty tired.."

She responded, "Uhuh.. But I did see you standing there talking to your make friends, so obviously.. you still weren't tired that time, even if it was close to closing.."

I said, "What..? I thought you already left.. um.."

She said, "Yeah, I messaged you saying I was leaving, not that I left. Look, I don't care about that, but it's obvious that you ignored me during that time."

I said, "It slipped out of my mind.. Shucks.. Sorry, then."

She responded, "Nevermind about that. It was dumb of me to assume you weren't busy all night.."

"I.." I looked away after this, processing her words. She was about to continue, but then stopped too, stuttering before going on her phone and going farther to a nearby seat.

"Why.. did.. she.. why is she so.. clingy? I don't.. Should I.. I.. this is so much.. Damn.. I gotta face her atleast, but what response..?" I thought to myself, eventually turning to face her, using her phone.

"Hey Rika." (Rika was her name) I called out, before she looked up at me and was clearly annoyed and almost glaring at me. "What..? Mizo?" She said, clearly with a hint of annoyance in her voice (Mizo's my name)

"I.. want to just.." I mustered the courage to say it. "Apologize.. It's all I can do."

"Apologize.. huh?" She said, as silence appears between us.

"Don't..  be like this, Rika. I just.. didn't.. I was.. just.. making some other connections, you understand.. right..? We talked about how.. it'd be better if we tried to talk with other people." I say as she is staying silent, opening her mouth to speak, but mumbling something then stopping as she pressed her phone closer to her chest.

"Mizo." She says as she puts away her phone. "Let's go." 

She stands up and drags me, then we walked to an arcade, she then spoke up, "Let's just have fun." she said, with a seemingly hurt tone, but trying to hide it.

And well, we tried to atleast, we went to a bunch of machines, we started with;

"Ooh! The mini ice hockey thing, let's do that." I say, as we then go and grab some play coins that totalled to around 50 then we started playing.

It went pretty well, after the mini ice hockey thing, we went to the basketball one, the driving one, the shoot-em-up one, then final, the vr shooting one, after that we ran out then raced each other to a milkshake tapo drink store, I ordered iced coffee with pearls, she ordered, after looking at me then listing out the options while shaking me she eventually chose, the matcha one with pearls and a lot of sugar and iced tea. We sat down and this is the convo that followed;

I was panting as we sat down on some fake grass in an indoor park in a mall, and she said, "Well.." 

"Well.. what?" I asked, as I patted her shoulder. 

"Well, wasn't that fun..?" She asked, with a smile that seemed genuine.

"Yeah.." I said, drinking some coffee.

"Yeah. It is. Now.." She said, drinking her coffee then turned to me, staring directly into my eyes.

"Mizo. I.. don't.. wish to.. strain anything. I.. don't.. want to lose you, like.. earlier. I know.. I might be a little.. well.. clingy.. But, I just.. want you to know, I.. won't just.. leave like that, okay..? I know you have your own.. stuff to do, and I have mine.. Just, remember me sometimes.. okay?" She said, as she gently touched my hand and looked at me intensely.

"Oh, um.. I will.. then. Haha.. Promise." I say, as we do a pinky promise, then we awkwardly hugged and pulled back quickly, I couldn't see.. but I think she was embarrassed too.

We just chatted and drinked after that.. That's the end.

## Gacha Procrastinación

## Author's Note:

Can you tell where I found the will to write this? Well, it's pretty simple. If Honkai: Star Rail can ruin my late evening, so will I too. Everything here is fictionalized of course, but is based on some true feelings and topics I felt willed enough to write.

Oh, and the reasons for like the specification of Mizo and Rika, the names was because I was writing this as I sent it over to help get opinions on it, you know, stuff.

— jmb~

"Ugh.. I am so.. tired right now.. So much work I did earlier duuude.. And I had to face the teachers like I didn't know that I was already late in passing my tasks.. Like, seriously..! Three performance tasks..! I.. just can't.. justify how.. I just.. misplaced the time that was required, like seriously.. I am so disappointed at myself for being so indulgent, not realizing the impending occurrence of my life.. I know, I know.. You're suffering too, but I swear, even you can just.. just.. pass some of them on time, while I have barely passed the 3 I needed to do.. since last week..!" She said, frustrated and also clearly agitated.

"Haha.. yeah.. Um.. I get it. But, if I may ask, what's the progress..?" I asked her, she clearly was a bit agitated but restrained herself from saying anything before responding;

"Oh you know, nothing. Barely a draft for that essay, barely a scrap of drawing for that comic task, and especially only a concept for that brochure.. Don't even ask, you know." She said, rolling her eyes.

"I.. yeah. But, you know.. I just, want to check up sometimes..?" I say, as she sighs and brushes her hair before turning to face me, with an annoyed yet regretful face.

"Did you know, what I spent my time doing instead..? Play this stupid video game where I sit around and do puzzles for 50% of the time, auto combat 20% and you know what.. almost all of them have this.. this long ass fucking dialogues with more yapping than one girl can handle in one night..! You wanna know the worst part? I DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING.. COMPLETE IT! I WAS STUCK ON THIS.. this boss, spoilers.. but this guy's pretty strong, and when I tried to fight it, I realized one thing. You need the new characters, with their builds ready, even just the DPS to beat that boss. Unless you want to suffer finding out why that's the case, take my advice." She said, before slumping on the chair, adjusting her glasses as she took deep breaths, while I processed what she said.

"I haven't.. played through that yet.. I just pulled because I wasn't that interested in for the reruns.. and well, I got the banner character. Only barely made it through, like around the.. Okhema arc..?" I said, as she looked up at me and smiled menacingly.

"Okhema huh.. When you just arrived.. hmm?" She said, before standing up and looking at me intensely. "Don't be an idiot like me. Realize that the 10 hour gameplay isn't lying. There is more yapping that's going to happen. You're lucky you have the previous pulls. I had to go around for.. 7 HOURS! Combined. In a span of two nights, to get the character. Be gracious in your luck, Mizo." (Mizo's my name) She said, as she crossed her arms and looked away.

"Alright alright.. Yeah, I.. don't spend much time in these games anyway, gotta write and all. So if you're procrastinating with gacha games, I'm procrastinating on my novel which will never be seen by anyone..!" I say, with a smile, feeling a bit ashamed by advertising my novel.

"Yeah yeah, your novel. Cool writer, learnt to use it on research?" She said as I looked at her with an amused expression. "Hitting hard I see, want me to remind you what you just said to me..?" I say, forming a sly smile.

"Psssh. Shush it then. Now, before I forget, help me figure this fucking essay." She said, dragging me to the chair next to her and making me look at her newly opened up laptop screen, with barely any words on a document, then she scrolled down, revealing rants about the gacha game, then the story we were supposed to review, then her parents before it stopped to show a singular huge image of the word 'The' with elegant writing.

"Here's where we start." She says.

## Dreadful Memories 

## Author's Note:

You can tell who I based this off. Anyway, another story. I'm starting to from this on out, this is now a spinoff of deltarambles. This is not an alternate timeline though, more of a story that happens in a larger one. Who knows? They might get some cameos, but.. for now, they're just the vaguely high school pair going through life, without the big magic and world ending events in their head.

Maybe just indulgent, but I'm willing to write until I don't want to, and that's the freedom I've been missing with the main deltarambles story. Longer plot points are good, but they do take a considerable amount of time now, even with a more fast writing.

I was walking, when I saw her, Rika. I walked up to her to greet her but I stopped myself when I saw she wasn't in her usual cheesy tomboy-ish happiness, she was more of the depressed one. "You're here." She says.

"I'm.. here. Yes." I say, I try to gauge her reaction but she seemed to stay in that exact neutral face, with a hint of sadness. "Sometimes, all someone needs is a little push. But, what if you've been pushed too far..?" She asks as I look at her and answer, "I... don't know, do you?" She nodded and sighed as she brushed her hair then got some water and drank it.

"Then.." She grabbed me then moved me to a more secluded area and nlw looked more agitated, frustrated and sleep-deprived.

"Then let me show you how much I hate myself. I haven't tried harming myself, but it would feel.. intense but.. exhilarating yes? Hate. It's a strong word yes? Shows me how much self-loathing I've built. The only thing I could think of is HOW STUPID OF ME TO BELIEVE IN OTHER PEOPLE. How.. naive. When, I should believe in myself. Look where that got me. LOOK AT IT." She slightly shows signs of bruising just below her neck, then shows off slight cuts at her lower abdomen.

"Tell me how much hope you can lose before you break? Tell me how much fake masking you can do until you decide to do what's the only thing keeping you from not existing.. Your self-hatred of cowardice." She said, our faces intensely close, she is almost pressing me to a wall, while she still looks angry and desperate.

"Rika..! You're getting too close for comfort.. I'll.. help, just not like this.." I say, before she chuckled before pulling back. "Why would I expect help when this is how I treat people? Even my best friend..?" She said to herself, with a bitter smile.

"Huh..? A—at least you reach out.. By reaching out to me.. at least, you can—" I am cut off by a sudden lurch of her towards me, her hands about to touch me before she turned away and looked away, heavily breathing, her hair now more tangled.

"Haha.. haha...." She laughs while she grabs her phone. "Hard work will pay off..? Huh, what a shame your stupid quote doesn't work out in reality." She closes it then turns to me. "Yeah, I want to be successful, sure. But, not like this. I'm.. not just some random girl to be a cog in the machine. But, I am sure you don't care either way. Die in the system, or be cursed out into the unknown of life, maybe you'll find your success in the annals of history, or not and just die. Your choice." She responds to an unknown person.

"Isn't this the messages from the stage during the usual monday school ceremony earlier..? What.. made you save them?" I asked, as she smiled. "Cycle.. Cycle..! Yeah. I remember that. Wasting time?! Wasting time..! I would rather die than continue to live like this. But, I can't. A coward's way out. Suck it up and live in a jar." She said, somewhat to me and to the unknown person.

"What is.. wrong with me.. Why do I think, I think.." She says as she grabs her phone and plays, 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' by Nirvana while she grabs some water to drink, completely ignoring me. I understood what she wanted by this and so stepped away and sat close enough to where I can see her, but not too close.

After a while, she stopped at the last 'What is wrong with me?' from the song then stood up and walked to her guitar she brought to the park we were staying at, and looked at me like she wanted to make me follow, so I did. We went to her house, and entered, her parents were out until the night, and this was right around 16:00, so we just sat at her living room and she brought out the guitar then after a few adjustments and tuning, she started to play the guitar cover of 'You Know You're Right' by Nirvana, while singing the lyrics with her phone slowly scrolling it nearby, while I listened.

As she sang the song, I felt quite relieved but worried at the same time, she even hit the notes perfectly, at least in her voice, I can see her tears start to form. But what stood out from me is she changed all the references to a 'she' to a 'he' in her cover of it, afterwards she turned off the guitar and just started crying right there, in front of me, while grabbing a handkerchief and covering her face from me. I silently patted her back as she did it, before she hugged me, and I hugged her.

## Researching Research

## Author's Note:

Thinkin' of a day that I'll finally break free from my chains and write the best adventure novel, anyways let's see.

Unresolved Issues?! Wow.

"Hey. Mizo, what's.. what's on your mind..?" said Rika, as she looked at me staring at my laptop screen with a somewhat unfinished draft of a manuscript of a school research project. "I.. can't.. describe it, it's.. like, you know, so overwhelming.,, just thinking about it." I said, as I fell over to the nearby bed, looking stumped and conflicted. "Um.. Lemme look at this, while I'm not a writer, I should just get a general idea for what your group has been writing.." She continued, before reading the manuscript, silently doing so as she scrolls through it. "Hey.. Mizo..?" She asked again, looking at me holding up a pillow in front of my head.

"What.. I.. just.." I mumbled some incoherent words before stopping. "Hey.. Mizo.." She said, standing up and trying to go near me. I quickly tighten my hold on the pillow while turning away. "Leave." I managed to blurt out, before silently crying. "L—leave..? That's not what we do, Mizo. I.. don't think I need to say what you have told me as well." She responded, as I remained silent, taking off my glasses and wiping my tears away. "Mizo.." She said, getting closer to me, but still hesitant to touch me.

"Go away, Rika. From.. the bottom of my sensitive heart, **leave**." I say, my strained tone makes it obvious now to what I was hiding from her. "I'll just.. close the laptop, gotta buy a new battery, hehe.." She said, awkwardly shuffling away and turning off the laptop, before audibly sighing and walking away from my room.

I compose myself, then I remove the pillow from me and look at the blank laptop screen with anguish that I can't describe. I sighed too, then turned to where Rika likely went through, the door of my room. "I'm sorry, so much.. But, while I know that my.. reaction was justified, it isn't.. excusable." I told myself, before she suddenly appeared with a neutral expression. "Hey, I got us some food." She said, while staring at me.

"Oh..? Yeah, okay.. What is it..?" I asked, as I got up and approached her. "It's a surprise, pal~" She smiled then dragged me to my kitchen table while covering my eyes. "Surprise..! Not really, though.. haha~!" She says, as she shows me two plates with rice and fried chicken, both have gravy sauce beside them and two drinks of soda about a large size for both of them. "Wow.. where did you order this, huh?" I asked as she looked away from me with a smile and answered, "Just.. delivery service. Thought it would be nice to grab some fast food for today."

"Fast food..? What, you can't co—" I say before a slap on my arm stopped me from finishing. "I can..! Shut up. What, desperate for my cooking or something?" She retorted while I chuckled and said, "Maybe a little, but I suppose this order would do. It's a better chance of eating not burned food, haha.." I say, as she slaps me again in response. "Shut up..! I swear, it's only fun when you're the one being teased.." She says, as she is slightly smiling. "Well, don't throw rocks when living in a glass house~" I say, as she slaps me for the third time. 

"Oh yeah, how about a machine gun huh?" She retorted with spite before I dragged her to her seat and responded, "Suppose I get it, you'd always want a weapon that can backfire." I said, as she wrestled my hands away and looked away, heavily blushing. "Just eat." She says, and I nod and sit down. I start eating the food and when she notices she starts eating too, looking like she forgot what we were doing just moments ago.

"Okay, okay. Aside from that.. I.. uh, got a few comments on your manu—" She cut herself off, as she shook her head. "Oh.. right. I'm sorry.. for bringing it up if it's so.. um.. traumatic..? For you.. I realize—" She said before I cut her off. "Hold it. I shouldn't make you.. **apologize**." I say before she cut me off. "Hey..! I get it, Mizo.. You don't have to be hard on yourself, I did something I didn't realize—" She said before I cut her off. "No, no.. You wouldn't have realized. Why would you..?" I say, as her breath shuddered.

"I still didn't ask.. if you were still.. comfortable talking about it. For that, I'm **sorry**." She says as I shook my head and held her hand. "**Please**. I.. none.. you.. you don't have.. to. Okay..?" I say, as I held her hand tightly. She tried to say something, but she stuttered before she stopped and she nodded.

"I am.. not.. this.. emotional, really.. but like.. I.. it just brought up bad memories. It's.. so..  confusing.. yet, I can't help.. help but feel a sense of.. dread. I'm.. going to my room. You have the couch and kitchen to yourself. Go to me if you want to sleep, after.. fifteen minutes." I say, finishing my food and putting it on the sink and leaving, leaving her to process what just happened.

## You Know You're Right

## Author's Note:

The title means exactly what it means.

Oh boy, this one was interesting to write. Let's just say very deep and heavy topic of self harm will come up.

— jmb~

---

"Hey..." She said, as she was looking off to the distance of our school balcony. "Yeah? Got anything to share today?" I asked, as she chuckled and turned to me, with an eerie smile. "I got just the thing." She said before suddenly taking a razorblade and using it on her lower neck area. I try to stop her but she pushes me away and gets a small cut, she then wipes the blood using a yellow handkerchief then she pressed on her wound using her hand as I went to pull her away.

"Stop. Stop. I need to do this." She says as we fight over her wound, she gets increasingly rough to match my adrenaline pumping moves to prevent her from hurting herself. "No! I won't." I continue to try and stop her, as she is visibly tearing up due to how much she's pressing on the wound while also trying to push me away. "Please..!!" She manages to shove me back as she spreads her blood nearby the wound accidentally, while she gets her handkerchief to dry off her tears.

"Rika..?" I ask, as she quivers while crying into her blood stained handkerchief, while the wound is now somewhat good now, it's still scarred, but now it's starting to heal. "Get away from me, now!" She said, turning back in shame.

"I can't.. go. I need you to be safe, Rika." I say, as we notice a teacher walking by and I quickly hid her and acted like we were about to kiss, to hide her pretty obvious wound. She tensed up, but she didn't make a move as she knew doing anything would be more.. concerning.

The teacher noticed us and he nodded to me as he passed through, we both pushed each other back as I looked at her and had a faint blush while hovering around her wound a bit.

"W—what..! I.. stop.. why.." Rika turned away as I slowly approached her. "What did you do..?" She says, trembling.

"It was to shield you. I know you don't want anyone else to know." I say, as she looks at me with tired eyes, before stepping back from me again, shaking her head a ton as she hid the razorblade and handkerchief back.

"I—I'm leaving." She says turning to run but I grab her shoulder. "No. Not until your promise me not to hurt yourself anymore." I say, with a serious face.

"Please.." She tries to wrestle me away but I remain steadfast. "Promise me. I don't want to see you hurt. Even by yourself." I say, as she shakes her head. "Yes.. yes..! Okay! Fine..! You're right. I should.. I shouldn't do.. this. You know you're right.." She says as she starts shaking more while keeping her head down.

Silence fills the hallway as a fellow student, a friend of ours was walking when she saw us and quickly rushed to us, noticing Rika's crying. "Kari..?" Rika says while I look at her, with a bit of a worried face.

"Rika..? Mizo..? What happened here..?" She asks, while I contemplate.

"Kari... I.. uh.." Rika shoves me in hopes to make me answer instead. "Huh..? Hey..! It's.. this is your issue. I'm not—" She looked up at me and did her best puppy eyes face as Kari looks on in confusion. "Fine. But, don't expect anything.. okay..?" I say more gently.

"What..? One moment Rika was crying her heart out, now she's just.. I don't know.. begging? clinging?" Kari says as Rika turns away, likely in shame. "I don't know. Okay..?" I composed myself, before I tried explaining what happened.

"Okay.. so.. Rika here... decided to.." I look at Rika, now shaking a bit as she is clearly listening but is still looking away. "...harm herself. Luckily, I stopped her before the bleeding got worse. Then we.. umm.. well, faced together when a teacher was going around and the best thing I thought would be to position her to a kiss. Obviously, we wouldn't, and didn't. Trust me on this one." I explain, as Kari gets progressively more concerned, while Rika held her arms around herself and was clearly trembling.

"So.. she.. wow." Kari says, while she looks like she's thinking while Rika turns around and hugs Mizo tightly. "Hey..!! Hey..?" I say, as I see her eyes about to burst with tears while her mouth was being forced closed while she held on to me tightly.

"Mizo..? Are you sure you two are just.. best friends..?" Kari asks, as I shake my head. "I don't know. But, what matters more is her safety. She.. she needs help. I just don't know if she can get one." I say, as Rika tightened further and started digging her nails into my polo. "I understand.. I just.. Okay, I knew she was going through a lot, didn't speak to me, and.. well.." Kari looks at Rika's disentangled and messy hair covering her back uniform. "She never does this. The self harm part I mean. We all have our own problems.." I respond as Kari nods and pats Rika's back as she stiffens and Kari instantly pulls back.

"Um.. Okay, this.. I.. was not prepared for this. Um, I have to go now though. See you, you two." Kari says and waves at us before leaving. As soon as Kari leaves, Rika instantly pulls back from the hug and with intense shaking. "T—thank you." She says as she grabs her things. "I.. promise. I just need some time alone. Do.. do you trust me.. no. Will you trust me again..?" She asked, as she looked at me with unintentionally desperate and needy eyes. A long silence followed, I needed to make sure what I say won't make her situation worse.

"Forget about it. I know you'll just say 'No'. I'm still going. It's going to be night." She says, before getting her things and leaving alone. "I.. wait..!" I called out, but she ignored me and continued to walk, I considered catching up but I stopped myself as she disappeared around a corner, leaving me alone.

## Chained Soul

## Author's Note:

"Let you live alone, in the world you have in place."

"You live your life like it's so easy and there's no meaning, but you don't know it's the calm before the storm. So, I play along."

"Do you want to know what.. my life has been.. Mizo..? Let me show you." She said, before she dragged me to her bedroom. It has a distinct pink and black contrast, her books and computer being mostly silver and charcoal black while her room and bed was with pastel pink and purple. "I don't.. want to wait for tomorrow." She says as she enables the laptop to start booting up, while she sits down at a barely functional swivel chair. I also noticed that her red floor was collapsing and had concrete showing. "I don't want to take it to the limit.. 'cause I'm already in it.. I can't make it better.. I.." She shuddered before she jumped to her bed. "..**surrender**."

I am trying to process what she's saying when her laptop finished booting and she immediately sprung up and went to it. I saw that she went to her documents, then recordings. "I don't record. This is.. more of a diary." She says as she clicks on one titled 'AKAHSHHSJHWWJWBWKSJEBDB'. "That's quite a long.. name." I commented before the markdown text file loaded. Here is the contents;

> GIVE ME LIFE GIVE ME GOOD GIVE ME SOMETHING FROM ABOVE
I AM PRAYING FOR ABOVE TO INTERVENE
I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE
BUT WHEN THE DARKNESS SETS IN
LIGHT SEEPS THROUGH LIKE A CURSE
URGING ME TO BE FREE OF MY SHACKLES
WHEN I AM HELPLESSLY ALONE
YOU APPEAR.
WHEN I AM TIRED OF YOU
YOU APPEAR.
I'M STUCK SEARCHING FOR SEARCHING 
GASPING FOR WATER AND AIR
I CAN'T FEEL YOU
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE OKAY 
DON'T SAVE ME DON'T TRY TODAY
YOU'LL END UP LIKE THE MANY PEOPLE THAT'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT AND LOST
I'M BURNING BRIGHT WHILE MY COLD CHAINS RESTRAIN ME
TELL ME O SILENT VOICE
WILL MY SALVATION COME?
OR WILL I BE RESIGNED TO MY FATE
TO HATE MYSELF?
LOSE IT.

She looked at it absent mindedly, like she was processing what she was doing when she wrote the note down. "This is.. when..?" She looked at the file's details, it was just three days ago, on a monday. Middle of the night, 3:00. "Oh god." She says as she sits down in a chair swiveling it around as I try to come up with words to say.

"What.." She repeated to herself, while she further made her rotation quicker while holding her head. "I.." Rika looks at me and jumps at me and faints, landing in my body very awkwardly.

"Rika..! Rika..?" I called out, but she was completely out, her face was relaxed now and almost seemingly put her weight on mine. I gently patted her head and slowly carried her to her bed nearby. "I.. don't know if you need medical.. assistance.. I just hope you feel better, okay?" I say to her unconscious self before leaving the room quietly, not before turning off her laptop and lights.

## Love Buzz

## Author's Note:

Taking a small break from the heavy emotions of these 'chapters' to pivot to more heavy emotions [this time can you guess..? ;) ] that are less.. into the depths of the abyss of people's worst emotions and turmoil. I can never complete the long ones so this short one is a lil' treat.. :D

— jmb~

"Come on..! You're taking your time, huh?!" She says as I calmly mop the floor of our classroom. "Shut up, you're not even an assigned cleaner today, and you think you can do better, _woman?"_ I retorted before she threatened to dirty the undried floor I just mopped. "Hey..! Stop.. no..!" I warn as she held her tongue at me. "Behh..! Tu madre es una puta tonto! Como tu!" She says, before I stared into her eyes. "Tu canto es.. tan bueno como.. las uñas en.. la pizarra..!" I say, as she directly steps over the floor to get closer to me.

"Young lady, I cannot—" I say in a formal tone before she pushes me to the wall behind me. "What? Where'd that voice go huh?! That bravado.. **show me."** She said, our bodies are very close, but not touching. "You know, if we stay like this, I might just get.. tempted." I say before I wink, and as she processed what I said, another random student that left her bags appeared on the door and opened it, seeing us very close.

"O—oh..! S—sorry..! Am I interrupting something..?" The student asks, as I look at Rika, the girl very close in front of me. "W—what?! No..! No!! You are not. I.." said Rika, she's the girl in front of me is clearly blushing as she moves away from the classroom and goes outside. "Don't.. um.. say anything about that.. okay..?" I ask the student as she smiles and nods. "Oh don't worry, Mizo. My lips are sealed tight. Though, I am not surprised.. do you two have a bond beyond.. friendship?" July (that's her name) asks, as I awkwardly laughed and looked away. 

"Um.. it's not that.. far. Just, umm.. we haven't figured that out yet." I answered, as July got her bags and moved closer. "Well, you better do.. Valentine's coming up after the exam and mid oral defense, if any deadline is to be thought of.. that's what I would say." July moves closer, with a friendly smile. "Why do you know..? Do **you** have a plan for February 14?" I ask as she turns away from me, likely hiding her blush. "I.. have a plan. But, but.. honestly, I'm more interested in you two, see how you develop.." She admits as I turn to face her back. 

"Really..? Your love life is not working out..?" I responded before she chuckled and turned back to me. "Well.. I'd say no. But.. it's been a struggle finding the perfect.. partner." She admits, turning to a more reflective tone. "Well.. yeah." Before I could say anything Rika went back inside and looked at me with a playful annoyance. "Are you still not done?! Talking to girls before you even finish your mopping.." She condemns as July laughs. "I better go now. See you in class tomorrow..!" She says before waving us goodbye.

"What..? Getting jealous are we.." I tease as she glares at me and crosses her arms. "Just finish the damn mopping, Mizo.." Rika then watched me complete my mopping while I had one earbud on to listen to grunge music while I kept my ears ready for anything from her. Although, she kept opening her mouth to say something, then not following through. Until she sighed then asked, "W—what are you listening.. to..?" 

"Nirvana. Specifically, all of Bleach: Deluxe Edition on my phone. Currently, it's.. Floyd the Barber that's playing. The studio version. You're a Nirvana super fan, you should know." I answer as her eyes lighten up. "No way..! Um.. you listen to.. haha.. right.. Um, what's your favorite song on Bleach, the studio recordings..? Mine is Downer." She asks as I smile and look at her intensely. "About A Girl." 

She immediately got what I was getting at and blushed intensely. "Sh—shut.. really..? That's.. wow.. yeah.. I guess it's a popular one, not really my thing.. For me, even Paper Cuts and Sifting are more.. to my liking." I smile and turn to mop more. "Meh, I haven't grown to like them. What, is Big Cheese in your top five?" I ask, as I turn to face her, she surprisingly nodded. "Y—yeah. Downer, Scoff, Blew, Negative Creep and.. Big Cheese. My top five." she elaborated.

"Wow.. I guess you must hate Smells Like Teen Spirit?" I ask, knowing of a few common tropes when being a Nirvana fan. "O—oh..! Well, it's not that it isn't a good song.. It's just not my favorite in it.. 'Drain You' is my favorite there, in the Nevermind album." She responded as I smiled and finished mopping and then as I was about to throw out the dirty water used, I looked at her, and we were both near the classroom door very close, I said, "Maybe I'd consider.. being that.. you in that song.." before quickly running away.

She was intensely blushing, but she ran after me, calling out; "H—hey..! Stop flirting, you.. incessant worm..!" She caught up with me when I arrived at a utility area. "Hey..! Hey..!" She calls me, while I am panting from exhaustion as I throw the dirty water away. "What.. what's gotten into you..! I.. you know how I feel about this.. Oh, how I long to punch you straight at your manhood.." She continued, while trying to calm herself down.

"Hey.. it's just a bit of teasing, hmm?" I say, as she calms down and looks worried. "I—I get that. But, oh I don't know.. with the blatant ways you flirt with me.. Mizo." She stopped herself as I finished the utility cleaning and looked at her, more seriously. "Are you worried that this.. friendship is more than that..?" I ask, as she hesitates to answer before nodding. "Yeah. Something like that. I.. just.. think I'm not.. fit for you, as a girlfriend.. There's no.. well, it's like siblings, you get me..? I'm grateful for you, and with our bond, it's just. the whole romance and sex thing isn't.. what I want for us." She explained, putting her hands to her chest, near her heart.

I contemplate her words, as I nod. "I get it. I'm used to teasing you about it, but.. never considered if you were.. well, also confused about it like I am. I mean, if someone were to flirt with me like I did to you, I would blush too, y'know." I say as we slowly walked back to our classroom. "So.. are those.." She trails off as I nod. "Yeah, I.. well, wanted to rouse you up more than you do to me. I figured it would be.. well, no I wasn't thinking." I stumbled on my words before we silently continued.

We made it to the room, then we silently cleaned up then locked the room for the night. 

"So.. are we still.." I ask, as she nods. "Yeah? Yeah! We're still going to eat dinner in that fast food restaurant I told you about. Come on, hurry up..!" She responds, before dragging me with her, to run to the super mall nearby.
