## Summary:

The sun shines on a busy afternoon, and Mijo is once again at a precipice of a new year of darkness and light. The duality of suffering and happiness, it weaves around until it can be wrestled and used for good.

## Author's Note:

A mostly prologue dealing with the plot setting up of Season 3, I guess. Further details will be added if necessary, as edits but if not, enjoy!

— jmb~

---

Mijo is walking on a cloudy day. He's in the light world in the local _freedom_ park. "It's been.. two months, huh?" Mijo looks around him, while no one around here knows his story, and he thinks, they shouldn't anyway, it still makes him feel _alone._ "I remember that day like yesterday. The cries, the laughs and the longing once we all went our separate ways.."

_Flashback._

Mijo is looking at Rhida, both in their school uniform as Rhida slowly walks away from him and the dark world opening. "I know you think higher of me, I know you all do." Mijo says to himself, as she can't hear his words from that range. "But.. I can't.. wrestle with it. These.. separations. They're all but one more bond broken for.." Mijo stops, as he looks at Rhida one more time before she turns to a corner, leaving him alone in his thoughts.

"..good?" Mijo answers, but it's shaky, he doesn't know if it's true anymore. "It's true, I got my wish, I saw you, and _and the Dark Pearl_ again." Mijo looks at his arms, legs and pink notebook, that was resting nearby along with his backpack. "I just wish it didn't take so much out of me." Mijo remembered moments, many regrets, many painful fights and many defeats only barely won. "It does make for a good adventure, I guess."

_Back to Present._

He was snapped back to reality, when he absent mindedly looked at a random girl in the park that looked just a tiny bit to Rhida. "Oh, right." Mijo shrugs. "Why am I always expecting fate to be by my side?" Mijo looks at the stage in the park, which has 'JESUS' written on its background. "I can only hope that God exists in both worlds, but.." Mijo looks away. "Then again, I probably wouldn't want to meet someone that let me almost die a bunch of times, gave me powers that hurt to use, and also.."  Mijo chuckles. "..the separations." Mijo continues walking.

_Later, at home._

"Let's continue my.. walk in there." Mijo says to himself, looking at the pink notebook. Mijo stabs it with a spare pen as the dark fountain spews out. "Got the.." Mijo checks the notebooks inside his room. "Pink for Jomi's Castle World.. Blue for Dajovy.. Purple for Nuevo Leon.. Peach for.. Compinter." Mijo nodded, as the ground collapsed and now he was free falling. "Alright.. What's the new enemy this time.." Mijo thought as he landed perfectly on the 'lightner' platform.

No Jomi was waiting for him. "Ah, right. I'm basically a part-time resident here. And.." Mijo grins. "Jomi is as busy as always." Mijo then starts walking, his full dark world form of a blue jacket and dark cyan pants. "Let's revisit something." Mijo walks to Jomi's castle as Jomi's guards meet him. "Good day, sir!" Mijo salutes them as he goes to a part of Jomi's courtyard where they put the remembrance for that version of the _Dark Pearl_ that featured **Ikari.**

'Here lies the magic-infused stone signatures of the 'Dark Pearl' as of April 11, 2025.'

_Jomi - jmmcjjaa~ 'The Princess of the Dark'_

_Mijo - Mijjcaljver 'The Lightbringer'_

_Urda - Urdnmg! 'The Wind of Golden Trees'_

_Jamise - Jmsee 'The Tides Trickster'_

_JR - JJRRB 'The Bulwark Rock'_

_Lauvielle - Lvlayaa 'The Shock Lawyer.'_

_Leviente - Lvvamg 'The Flame Defender'_

_Rhida - Rhiiadrramp 'The Ice Queen'_

_Ikari - Kaiirotut 'The Lavawalker'_

Mijo goes silent as he sees the names of his friends and where they could be now. "I have no need to.. recollect what happened here." Mijo says. "I.. have moved on." Mijo looks around the  surrounding courtyard. "At least.. I want to believe so." Mijo sighs. "I just.. wished separations weren't so.. long and reunion so.. unstable and crazy, ugh." Mijo then salutes the Dark Pearl Statue before leaving.

"I better head to the training area. Ugh, my muscles are all hurting just by crouching like this." Mijo stretches his arms. "Gotten lazy _and_ weak. Typical." Mijo then walks as he summons his original sword and unsheathes it. "I do wish I could use this outside of here.. ugh, It'll make so much more **things** easier." Mijo sighs again. He noted that. "Anyways, let's just.. get there."

Mijo walks around, he thinks the castle looks busy.. Jomi's guards moving around, staff with documents, paper, the usual government stuff. The castle seemed so big and empty before, but that was before the **first**.. and **second..** cataclysms. 'Huh, there sure are a lot of cataclysms every year or so..' Mijo thinks to himself, he wonders if Jomi is free after the workday is done but he puts it off.

Mijo goes to the training area and fiddles with the controls again. "Huh, nothing changed." Mijo mumbled, of course, he didn't really think it would but was curious to see, just in case it did. "Alright. Jomi I guess." Mijo selects Jomi Boss Battle - Medium Difficulty as the area transforms and Mijo stretches his arms and legs as he positioned himself to unleash Iaijitsu.

"I—If I have to fight you then I shall." Boss Jomi says as she charges up her sword attack. "If I remember correctly, there's an easy way to defeat this version easily." Mijo eyes Boss Jomi as she unleashes sparks of electro and walls of cryo all over the arena (the training area has become an arena) as he dodges without a single slash from Mijo. "Still got it.. ugh.." Mijo groans at the adrenaline coursing as well as the phantom pain.

"Let's end this." Mijo touched the hilt of his blade as he unleashed many slashes and even many direct cuts to ice blocks built or thrown in Mijo's direction. "You.." Mijo dodges an ice block. "shall.." Another slash to prevent blockage. "_DIE!_" Mijo unleashes his lightning attack, going into light speed to slash around as he went back to normal speed to follow up with a pyro attack using his other sword from his time in Dajovy. "Burn until I do!" Mijo unleashes red hot flames against Boss Jomi as she disintegrates.

Mijo lands as he falls to the ground on his knees being held up by the sword stabbed on the ground. "Ugh.. I keep using.. it.. it.. keeps hurting.. pain.. keeps.. me.. strong..!" Mijo stands up wobbly as his swords disappear. "You're here." Mijo says to a Jomi clapping slowly. "Wow. What a great move. Though, should've just picked the realist difficulty. Not like it would've changed a damn thing, since you're soo powerful, but.. hey, so you're in the dark world.. New school year?" asked Jomi as as Mijo chuckled.

"Yeah." Mijo sheathes his sword. "No wonder you're training then. Must mean.. well, nothing much on my side of things, anyway.. The city.. as well as.. the other worlds are.. fine. No abyss-level threats after that Christmas." asked Jomi as she immediately moves to that topic, as Mijo nods. "I see." Mijo looks around. "I suppose I shouldn't expect every threat to come out before school." Mijo shrugs. "Last time, it took a certain empty room, and the other.. well, more.. _cold_ appearances." Mijo holds Jomi's hand.

"Ah..! Yeah. I suppose so.. A—anyways, stop holding my hand like that, let's go to my office to chill for a bit.." said Jomi as she gently moves away Mijo's hand. "Surely, you..?" Mijo laughs a bit, finding amusement in these moments. "Of **course** I have time." Mijo boops Jomi's nose making her squeak and protect her nose using her left hand. "Why would I be here? Hah." Mijo looks at the window that overlooks the area from the office. "I suppose you were watching me, huh?"

Jomi looks down. "I—I..! Yeah. Of course. L—Let's just move on.. already.." Jomi grabs Mijo's hand then drags him with her to her office, passing by many guards, staff and other people in the castle. "Woah, your castle's lively. I still remember when it was just.. you, me and Urda." Mijo comments as he looks at guards chatting as well as some staff too. "Oh yeah.. Haha.. How.. u—um.. time passes.." Jomi is bothered by some staff in something Mijo doesn't bother to process.

'Looks.. normal. I notice how Jomi doesn't ever pull away. It's.. comforting, but like.. weirdly.. I mean, she's me.. and I'm her... Can we hate ourselves, but love each other? Huh? Wait can that even.. well.. I do hate myself, but I like her, she's.. what I want to be.. It's just.. that's—' Mijo's train of thought was crashed by Jomi who was now looking at him with slight concern. "Buddy. Mijo? Knight?" Jomi called out, snapping her fingers as they were in Jomi's office conveniently.

"Yeah? I was just thinking about how to.. sneakily push you into be—" Mijo smirks as Jomi visibly flusters and looks away. "Shut." Mijo laughs. "Let's.. just sit down." said Jomi as she and Mijo sat down.

"Alright, I think I can infer a lot of what happened.. Just, give me the gist of your current.. 'eternal winter' situation." Mijo says as he looks outside. "O—oh.. yeah.. the.. Dajovy reclamation process has been.. slow.. at best." Jomi tugs on her purple blouse. "W—we just haven't seen much of a breakthrough in terms of  that elemental robot we found, and.. admittedly, the city's tense and filled up. That's why I have a lot more people in my castle.." explained Jomi as Mijo nodded.

"Ohh.. right. Your.. world is literally just your castle, and Dajovy is only like.. a city and some towns beneath?" Mijo moves his head in disappointment. "Tsk tsk.. I see. Isn't Nuevo Leon.. well.. right. That's still.. a mess. Hey, what happened there anyway?" asked Mijo, as Jomi pondered while looking at the ceiling. "Um. After the second cataclysm? Uh.. I—I guess it's like outer Dajovy in terms of desolation.. Huh. It's just.. I guess we haven't like.. thought of going back there since the Cara-Rasca fight destroyed a lot of stuff.. a—and the abyssal corruption.."

"So.. basically, you want me to go there to destroy abyssal corruption and move over some people, if I get where this is going." Mijo says. "Oh. I.. well.. I was about to say that. W—we have resonators. Sasha.. Anastasia.. But.. me and them are too important for running Dajovy to focus on Nuevo Leon. Even Sasha. Like, we can't.. umm.. well, like Nuevo Leon is hostile right? So.. there's no guarantee that we'll come back.." explained Jomi as she saddened her expression. "A—and.. as.. we've experienced.. we really can't send small-time resonators either.. risk losing them to the corruption."

"I see. So it isn't all sunshine and rainbows here.. Though rainbows are rare here.. You get my point. I guess.. I'm trading light world problems for.. dark world problems? Where a mistake could.. doom the dark world to the abyssal corruption or outside here, where I'm doomed if I don't pass." Mijo reflects. "S—small correction.. Don't you have to do both..? A—at least the group ones?" asked Jomi as Mijo sardonically laughed. "Yeah. It.. wasn't a problem until it became _HALF_ of my damn school works." Mijo shakes his head.

"Worse part is.. I can't exactly.. Well, I've never exactly tried it with others I don't know as much but.. you know? Bring them? So I can skip stuff.. _Problem_, I have to trust them enough so they won't become a problem lightner." Mijo thinks. "You know.. uh.. yeah, Deltarune?" Mijo asked Jomi. "Yeah, it's been.. in my.. memories since the first cataclysm. Um, yeah they did release two new chapters, right?" Mijo nods. "And basically, the main antagonists are the lightners since a certain knight is one of them. Basically, point is, even though abyssal monsters and people are a problem, lightners could be worse as they exist in both the light and the dark."

Jomi thought. "I—I guess you were lucky, huh?" Mijo nods. "Very much so." Mijo looks at the desk of Jomi, very disorganized with papers and a single lone PC-lookalike turned off in the middle of all the regal decorations. "Anywho.. Back to the main problem. I can solve the abyssal monster problem, but.." Mijo thinks. "I might have to do it alone. And.. I also need a way to cleanse if I find a source." Jomi looks at Mijo, half worried and half disappointed.

"I—I see.." Jomi sighs. "A—are you sure you're.. going alone?" Jomi reflects. "It's just.." Jomi keeps both of her hands to her chest. "It's just.. you know.. I can't go with you, right?" Jomi asks. "If it's not endangering Dajovy, yeah no." Mijo answers. "Right, and.. I'm not sure if anyone else but me can handle the abyssal corruption and cleansing.. But.." Jomi thinks. "I can't go.."

"Fine. I'm helping **you** first." Mijo says, a bit more firm. "How are you a leader if you can't—" Jomi interrupts with, "H—hey! Just because.. this is tough alright?!" Mijo is speechless. "Ugh.." Mijo clears his throat. "What I meant, is.. there's no way you **can** go? You went with us in every adventure, even during Nuevo Leon. What changed?" Mijo asks as Jomi looks down quietly, thinking before looking at Mijo, with a serious face. 

"It's.. a lot. Firstly, due to the growing populace.. There's some.. discontent in what I'm currently doing. Many many things have been said. Secondly, there's.. also a lot.. of.. abyssal magic that doesn't come from me. I'm guessing some people have taken matters into their own hands. Thankfully, I have some.. people that use it.. like me but.. it's.. not looking stable for me to leave for something I cannot guarantee will go smoothly. Lastly, there's been some ongoing court war on Scians-Chemistra or something, I haven't looked over.." Jomi sighs and curls up on the sofa. 

"I—It's a lot.. and.. I haven't thought much on how to.. truly solve all of it. As I can't go to Scians-Chemistra without leaving issues in Dajovy unsolved, but there's no.. existential solution. Unless it involves you lightners, or.. I guess someone as capable as me." Jomi lies down on the sofa fully as Mijo processes the situation, and also lies down on the sofa, thinking. The two are silently thinking before Mijo speaks up.

"Is there a deadline?" asked Mijo, as Jomi stutters. "U—uh.. I—I don't know. But.. it's fine.. Mijo, y—you have time. I—I think? I don't want you to.. y'know." Jomi looks at Mijo looking upwards. "I don't wanna see you hurt.. again." Mijo wryly chuckled. "Hah. Being alive _is_ painful." Mijo looked at Jomi. "It's fine. The.. previous.. breakdown I had was.. a reaction of the inexperience of destruction." Mijo closed his eyes, slightly smiling. Then he opened his eyes as he looked at Jomi, still smiling.

"I'm used to it. I just.." Mijo looks up before standing up and stretching his arms. "I just need more time to think, I guess, and.." Mijo stretches his neck. "Find some new lightners, I guess. Haha~" Mijo laughs sardonically. "But in all seriousness, I.. as much as I don't want to admit it, I do need companions." Mijo thinks. "So, I'll be chilling in-and-out of the dark world for some time. I still need to figure out more of the situation." Mijo looks out. "Will I be recognizable.. Huh, yeah I am.." 

"Hey, Jomi? You have.. uh some clothes I could borrow for walks? My outfit is.. very recognizable, and.. I might need to change sometimes." asked Mijo, as Jomi thought. "W—we can use transformation magic..?" Mijo laughs. "Then I'll be even more recognizable. Who casually forgets the face.." Mijo moves closer to Jomi. "..of my cute, beloved oppressor?" Jomi blushes. "I—I can.. um.. still use **some** other form.. Um, I—I think, I actually haven't.. tested any.. B—because..! I didn't need to! W—without my public regal clothes and some.. hair adjustments, I'm fine..!"

"Alright, so.." Mijo smirked. "You don't **have** one for me? Girlie, I thought you'd have a male or androgynous disguise..." Jomi nodded flustered. "I—I.. do! I just haven't.. used them..?" Mijo laughed. "It's fine. I.. don't need it for now." Mijo turned to the door. "I'll have some more.. reflecting to do. Stay safe, Jomi, and.." Mijo looks at Jomi again, a bit apologetic. "I'm sorry for.. calling you out.. I know you know that already. Just, be cool, hmm?" Mijo pats Jomi's head as she freezes but reluctantly lets happen before Mijo leaves.

"D—damn you and your.. charm..? I mean.. we're.. oh god, do _I_ have flirting skills I have no knowledge of?!" Jomi says as she looks at her office door.

_Mijo, in the Dajovy City Plaza._

**One of the many unspoken rules is to not disturb lightners unless you are disturbed by them, interestingly enough.**

There, in the cold yet somewhat warm plaza, after a while of simply admiring the place, Mijo sits down in one of the chairs. "Let's see.." Mijo recounts whose names he can likely reach according to what fate has brought. "Urda. She's in my class this time. With the sacrifice of.. ugh, literally _everybody else."_ Mijo looks at the reader (yes, that's _you_) unintentionally, unamused before looking away.

"It's as if god.. if they even exist, I am cursed with progression, I wanna stay stagnant with my friends, dammit." Mijo chuckled darkly. "Though.." Mijo sighs as he looks onto the people casually walking around on a fine Dajovy night, lit up with Kugol' all around, the orange hue over the white city. "We definitely had an adventure, that's for sure." Mijo looks at the massive ice-geo statue depicting an ice structure with jagged lines and straight lines being wrapped by geo rocks in Kugol'. 

"I guess.. ugh." Mijo is drifting off, listening to some random conversation, something about cervical spines or whatever. He's not paying attention to whether that makes sense or not. "The hospitals are.. yeah.. there's not enough... princess.. abyss.." said the words of whatever he can make out. "Damn. Right, of course." Mijo nods. "The people." Mijo thinks more. "What happens once I.. complete it though?" asked Mijo, looking up to the night sky, it's dotted with stars, though Mijo isn't sure whether they actually exist or not.

"I thought it was over when Cara.. presumably died that day, or when she and Rasca were vanquished at Nuevo Leon.. Now..?" Mijo sighs. "Right, as long as something exists.." Mijo stands up. "It can be remade." Mijo summons his sword. "I should've said destroyed.. But, like.. Cara is 'I always come back' or something, so that isn't true." Mijo smirked before making his sword disappear as he started walking back to the spot to the light world.

"I need to.. speak to someone, but.." Mijo stretches his arms. "It'll be a few days before then.. Let's gather as much detail." Mijo goes silent as he goes up to the light world. 

_Ikari and Mijo Conversation.. Background Photo is a random purple-ish color with a heart in the middle.._

Mijo: yo.. uh dark world?

Ikari: Dark world?? Oh yeahh what about it??

Mijo: there's going to be a lotta problems for it in the following school year, you think you can make it..?

Ikari: Maybe

Ikari: Honestly, sun probs my last free day

Mijo: I see.. But, do you think you can be called upon, just in case it spills over to the light world?

Ikari: Probs not fr, busy with GSP stuff but

Ikari: Yeah just message me and if I can I will go

Ikari: Is it open and where is the entrance

Mijo: Still thinking of some spots, used my backup world in my backpack

Ikari: Ohh okay rightrighty then just tell me so I know where to go

Mijo: Cool cool (Ikari reacted with 👍)

_Urda and Mijo Conversation.. Blank Background._

_Funny emfna..._ (Mijo): Yo. Dark world.

_Dumb idiot a..._ (Urda): Dark world

Mijo: Yes.

Urda: New boss?

Mijo: Not yet idk

Urda: Then what?

Mijo: Some problem in Nuevo Leon I need your help with

Urda: Oh yeah what happened there

Mijo: Gist is; I need help killing some abyss monsters and restoring land.

Urda: Sounds like hard work

Mijo: Ofc it is and who knows, honestly, there's like dime-a-dozen beings in that desolate place,  we might find one

Urda: Coolerino then but like when and what exactly are we doing

Mijo: Just.. speak to me in school after the usual... intros and stuff.. I actually don't know where that it's safe to talk or create one without disturbance

Mijo: But if I don't have any, just meet me somewhere near the balcony, I'm usually there chilling (Urda reacted with ❤️)

_Planning.. Hours later, June 14, 2025._

Mijo is traveling for his sister, Deciene's (shortened to Dess') boarding house for whatever college internship, he thinks. As he's riding in a bus with his parents, he's already wondering what to do with the dark world days from now. 

"Nuevo Leon.." Mijo murmurs as everyone else is sleeping. "I got a certain pirate onboard, or even the flamewalker if I'm lucky.. The thing is.." Mijo looks over his other contacts, and immediately closes it as he hovers over Rhida's name. Mijo goes silent for a while, before sighing. "I'm trying to move on, Rhida.. It's just.." Mijo looks at the winding roads and fields outside the bus' window. "I can't." Mijo scratches his head almost regretfully. "Who can replace you..?"

"Ugh. I sound like a **fucking** idiot." Mijo scoffs. "Don't I?" Mijo looks at his mother, May right beside him, sleeping and even then, couldn't hear his mumblings. "Yeah..." Mijo continues looking onwards to the endless road ahead. "I do want to believe I'm holding out for someone, but.." Mijo sighs. "It's just not the same." Mijo shakes his head. "Never is going to be. Ugh, I keep.. remembering _her._"

"I'm like those hopeless romantics in poems or writings.." Mijo mocks a voice. "Oh my hopeless romance..!" Mijo chuckles. "I want you to be the love of my life, the one to bear my children..!" Mijo slaps himself playfully on this, as he felt a bit embarrassed in saying this. Since first, he _just_ lost the love of life, and two, he doesn't even want to have children, forever. At least, that's what he keeps telling himself, even _he_ doesn't know if his **libido** is going to agree with him on this.

"Ugh, disgusting.." Mijo keeps thinking about it anyway. "What would I even say.." Mijo thought. "Am I even.. uh.." Mijo instinctively recoils. "Sexually attractive??" Mijo shakes his head. "E—even so, surely we won't.. well.. I won't be dumb enough, right?!" Mijo thinks too many times where he doubted his own stupidity and was proven right. "Fuck.. I gotta start thinking about this now, right..?" Mijo thinks. "College is where my parents met and that's basically like not that far away from me now.."

This train of thought has been fortunately derailed by a buzz from his phone. "Oh..?" Mijo looks, it's just a message from Dess' that is asking their ETA to the bus terminal at the big city, some place called 'Cubao'. "Makes sense.. I'll just reply." This got him about minutes of distractions from his thoughts as he switched topics, dissociating like a '**boss',** apparently.

_UP Diliman. 10:30. Still June 14._

Mijo is consciously (or subconsciously, he can't tell sometimes) is walking behind most of the other 'college seniors' in his immediate family, like his sister Dess, Lentz (his aunt's kid, also indirectly older sis) and Ardo, her cousin's boyfriend (?). Honestly, whatever the friend group this is supposed to be Mijo can't tell, and he thinks that this is irrelevant to the dark world anyway, so.. he once again drifts off into his own thoughts while walking the pathways of this prestigious college.

"I can't stop thinking about college." Mijo says to himself. "It's like.. a looming threat with a far-enough deadline to where I can chill a day without being harmed, but chill for too long and destroy yourself.." Mijo chuckles darkly. "Just like the dark world, wonder why.." Mijo looks at the reader (*yes, he keeps looking at you..*) **again** before looking away. "Anyway, besides the point. The dark world's easier, though."

"I have experience, if necessary I can definitely bring in new lightners to the dark world.." Mijo thinks. "My only problem is.." Mijo looks to the vast green fields of the university, a luxury for a public and popular one. "Well.." Mijo sighs. "_That_ life." Mijo doesn't know if the haze that suddenly crept into his mind is because of this, but, he's hazy in thinking so he can't process it well. "I.. have been waiting for _so long_ to end _that_ life." Mijo, even though he sees no one touch his shoulder, still feels something crawling on his skin.

"Coming back.." Mijo narrows his eyes. "..Feels _so bad._" Mijo reflects on his summer vacation. "For how many times I crashed out.." Mijo chuckles darkly. "I don't know if I'll... _feel_ like that again." Mijo crosses the 'Tau Alpha Walkway' as he looks onto stagnant waters, even more grassy fields, and concrete bridges. "Should I feel..?" Mijo thinks. "I do though." Mijo further reflects. "It's not that I don't. In fact, it I can process it, I'll definitely have a reaction, and by definition, a feeling but.."

Mijo can't shrug off something this important. "Ugh. It's.. hard to try and feel something worth if... if.." Mijo thinks to the hell that _was_ Nuevo Leon before its desolation, wars and destruction.. Constant fighting, dark or light world, he'd never stopped fighting. "_Everything else hurts._" Mijo just feels exhausted just by thinking about the months leading up to the end of that school year. He also starts to feel feelings he can't even name, something sad, something angry, something in-between..

"Fuck. I have to learn to be better." Mijo tried to taste the hollow words in his mouth. "Or.. whatever that means." Mijo looks at the trees providing shade to the campus, making sure the sun doesn't fully gaze upon his soul. "If I go to the dark world with _them again_, would it be a repeat of last time?" Mijo questions this, but he knows the answer is never clear for him. "I.. I'll have to plan first. I can't let my past interfere with my future." Mijo says, but even he doesn't believe it, he's wondering if he will _ever_ do though.

_Manila Chinatown. 12:00_

Mijo is walking in this hustling and bustling part of the city, where multiple stores congregate and coagulate into a lot of people buying, chatting, selling, waiting and whatever is to do in this fine part of the city. As for Mijo, he heavily dislikes this part of the city, not only because it's filled with many many people, but also it reminds him of Dajovy, and it's overpopulation crisis.

As his group that includes May, Dess', and Lentz go around and stop at food places, Mijo thinks as he drifts off again. "It's.. weird thinking like I'm about to die once school rolls in." Mijo thinks back to a vague dream he had on the bus ride. "It.. featured me, being left alone _again_ by Urda and Ikari for.. _various_ reasons I can't remember, but.." Mijo gets an ice cream small cup from May. "But.. it's probably something dumb like..."

Mijo starts eating the ice cream as they move again. "Outside perspective or.." Mijo looks at a person that had the same hairstyle as Urda before she disappeared. "..they moved on?" Mijo eats another scoop. "It's.. weird. I dread the day, yet it's so.." Mijo goes under a big umbrella that's held up because it was being used by a local street vendor selling dragon fruit flavored bubble tea. "...near. I guess it's because I have to do it. But, it's more than that.."

The world disappears in his mind for a minute as he starts monologuing properly. "Before.. during.. the dark world.. I was.. **never** a true leader." Mijo imagines Jomi. "She is." Mijo thinks back to the cyber world. "I only was one because of my powers. Because I felt.. powerful." Mijo imagines Jomi and Cara. "She.. used to be powerless and now powerful.. Me? I haven't been one."

Mijo imagines the Dark Pearl. "They'd all say.." Mijo sees the Dark Pearl cheering on and doing excellent maneuvers because of Mijo. "You're such a great leader, Mijo! But.." Mijo imagined himself looking at his school during one of many days of normalcy. "I never amounted to anything outside of it. In fact," Mijo sees the grades in his report card, from 1st to the 4th quarter, most middle of the road, others a complete failure. "I failed."

"But.. I'm still here aren't I?" Mijo thinks to the last meeting of him and Rhida. "Just.. not the same individual. But.. the same _circumstances_ haven't changed." Mijo looks at the gate of the school. "Same problems, same authority, and the same dread." Mijo sighs as the imaginary world shatters, the chinatown coming back to his senses. "Just another day of being me."

"Hey, Mijo~" Dess says. "Try this!" Dess shoves the boba dragon fruit mix as he reluctantly does so. Then afterwards, he commented, "It tastes like dragon fruit liquid sugary mess." Dess chuckled. "Yeah.. But it's fun!" Dess says, before turning to Lentz to talk about something Mijo couldn't overhear. "Though, there's something else." Mijo says, looking at the street then the buildings, before smiling.

_The group was eating at a local chinese restaurant. Still in Manila Chinatown. 14:30_

"I guess it's about.. me being able to experience not being myself..?" thought Mijo as he chewed on raw (no sauce)  steamed white chicken. "I'm not _exactly_ a good person in the light world.." Mijo gets more fried rice, with toppings. "I have **very** low self-confidence, looks and acts antisocial, and very nihilistic and quick to anger." Mijo pours just a bit more rice. "Also acts like a _victim_ always." Mijo doubts whether this means he feels guilty and pity for himself for blindly following or he feels guilty for feeling guilty in the first place.

"In the dark world?" Mijo chuckles. "I'm powerful, heroic and self-sacrificial." Mijo grins darkly. "Am I **truly** heroic? Or am I a savior complex self-destructive loser who only succeeded because I had the power to **actually** do my deluded fantasies?" Mijo thinks there should be a therapist for these types of talking, but then again, he thinks and wishes a lot, but most of them aren't fulfilled, whether he can do anything about it though.. that's a question he can't answer.

"Ugh. No point in thinking about this. Let's focus on the damn.. plan." Mijo sighs, before drinking his iced sweetened coffee. "It doesn't matter, if I can't.. _do_ anything about it." Mijo's force on getting another chicken tender and eating its juicy meat was a bit more forceful than usual. "Let's just.. plan. Damnit. I should just trauma dump on Jomi later, when I get home.." Mijo eats a siomai in one big chomp, getting some looks.

_Lucky Chinatown Mall. @ Matcha Tea Place 15:16_

"Alright.." Mijo is now typing on his phone. "Good places..?" Mijo thinks of the location, his classroom is somewhere in the 3rd floor, 6th according to the class GC, but he doesn't know how 'isolated' it is. "Is it.. like last grade where the room is in the middle of things? Is it on the sides? If so, are there any good spots that can be conspicuous.." Mijo further reflects, eating his ice cream from a local DQ (yes, that one..).

"Maybe.. the classroom.. that's always an option, and.. a chance, if there's a new dark world, which.. is.. not good." Mijo thinks. "I'll just have to see.." Mijo sighs. "Okay, but.. there's not a good 'permanent' spot."  Mijo thinks. "If my guess is correct, I'm in the.. that building. On the.. ugh, third floor, right? Right, so my guess.. is we.. wait, technically, I haven't been there, how will I..?" Mijo scoffs, then eats more scoops. "Fine. Let's just use my bag then, it'll be fine, for now."

"Mmmm.." Mijo appreciated his dairy queen cookies and cream ice cream for a second before getting back on topic. "Okay, once in.." Mijo reflects. "Jomi's help is unreliable.. So is Ikari's.. Urda's probably the only reliable one, but problem.." Mijo eats more. "Let's see how I do on Monday." Mijo thinks. "There's no way to plan stuff, without any foreseeable way.." Mijo eats the last scoop of ice cream. "If Urda doesn't go well, I still have to see the land for myself." Mijo nods. "That is settled, I guess."

_Let the world burn once more._

## Author's Note:

3 days.. The 3 days of.. this. Okay, let me get something out of the way, I was thinking of putting one more section about personal stuff related to Mijo, in the Venice Mall.. in the Philippines.. Manila.. No clue why it exists, but.. yeah, I wanted to have one, but.. I have pretty much exhausted the locations as well as what to say that hasn't already been said before. Anyway, we need a complete chapter and this is one of 'em. The new season needs a chapter to anchor it.

I'm not sure if I'm going to have a good progress roadmap, since school is hell, and I can't guarantee I'll have something done. 

But, as for the story and if it'll be like Season 1 or 2 in terms of pacing? It'll depend, we'll see. But, most likely: S2. But! I'm likely going to separate seasons per grading, so this will be longer in terms of chapters but same length as an S2 arc (C1-4,5-9) in the timeline... Probably. That's the plan, but my plans are always in flames, so.. anyway, that's all I got for ya, peace!

...

"I see." Mijo says as he looks over the bustling streets below, the wind caressing his skin. "Whatever battered hope I had," Mijo uses his right hand to feel the wind. "_has been lost to the wind._" Mijo thinks. "Why am I always expecting to be **blessed** by **fate?**" Mijo turns back, and sees familiar and unfamiliar faces, both blurring in the sea of students. "2:50. And this is where I am?" Mijo asks himself. 

_Urda and Mijo.. Hours ago, 12:30._

"Hey." Mijo says as Urda bids goodbye to her other friends as she goes up to Mijo. "Yoo..!" Urda leans to the balcony. "So.. dark world?" Mijo nods and replies, "Yeah," Mijo looks out. "It's a tough battle out there." Mijo looks at his hands. "Nuevo Leon. It's destroyed, and filled with abyss monsters." Mijo looks at Urda, with a stare worth a thousand yards. "Oh.." Urda looks away. "M—makes sense."

"It's.. not.. great there, and the works might pile up." Mijo says the cold hard truth. "I—I see." Urda looks to the rain that just started. "I still want to." Urda resolved. "But.. I need some time. I want the dark world to be accessible like during that cyber world again." Urda is concerned. "That's why, I wanted to ask if you have any places you think are great..?" Mijo thinks. "I've scoped out the building." Mijo shakes his head. "That part in time was lucky. Remember afterwards, where—"

"Yeah! I—I know and.." Urda sighs. "I—I just want it to be always open, so we can train and stuff.. Bring friends in, and.. yeah!" Urda grins. "A lot have left, let's make new ones." Urda suggests. "I'll.. think about it." Mijo looks down. "I haven't got used to the schedule yet. I'll message you when I have one. Go on, have fun." Urda nods, smiling. "Okay!! Thanks, Mijo." 

_Back to 14:50._

...

"Maybe I shouldn't.."

Mijo overhears teachers exhausted of the staircases, by the staircases. "May CR ba dito??" A male teacher asks, as the other taller one responded. "That one. It's locked though, di ko alam bakit." Mijo smiles darkly. "What a coincidence." Mijo goes back to his classroom and grabs his backpack, then gets the necessary things. "Pen.. notebooks.." Mijo then opens the backpack.

He looked around, and.. slightly 'nudged' (pushed very hard) to the door and it somehow opened. A dark world. "No fucking wonder." Mijo breathes very heavily before jumping in. His backpack and other bags dissolve as his sword appears. He lands in a very dark world, so dark that only the flames in his sword light the way.

"Alright." Mijo fires fire slices to light the way, eventually finding a path that leads to a light just in the very far corner that he ran very fast to stand at as he notices a switch. "Bathroom.. switch? Weird." Mijo flicks it anyway as lights flicker open, lighting the very dark now visible mall around him. Before he could say a word, suddenly people appear as they shop around and walk and sit down to talk, it seems like a normal mall.

"Oh?" Mijo exclaimed. "This must be a new dark world." Mijo thought. "Fuck. Where am I.." Mijo starts walking around as his sword disappears to blend in with the crowd. He walks around, seeing some appliance store, some knicks-and-knacks store, an arcade, a department store and a general shop for things that can be used for D.I.Y. stuff. "Wow.. sure looks familiar.." Mijo thinks of the store in his light world, eerily familiar but in different contexts.

"Wait." Mijo rushes to the bathroom, the male first, but does not find what he's looking for. He sighs and looks around before switching to a female form using a potion Jomi gave him during the farewell party of the second iteration of the Dark Pearl. "Wow~ Ugh.. shit why is this so.. huh?" Mijo looks down, it's done but.. damn, did Jomi literally just..? Nevermind. "I—I.. okay?" Mijo goes to the female bathroom and goes to each stalls discreetly before finding the.. empty one that looks like the light world exit.

"I wonder how.." Mijo shakes _her_ head. "Nevermind. It's a dark world. Let's explore the rest.. later..?" Mijo thinks. "Let's just find a good portal spot for Jomi. Speaking of which, she says she has the same feeling whenever a dark world opens up so.. I bet she's somewhere here." Mijo laughs and clasps _her_ hands. "Let's prank the shit out of her."

_Jomi POV._

"Wow.. so this is.." Jomi tries to read the sign. "Manecony.." Jomi is surprised by the advertisement that pops up on the sign and hides her face in the embarrassment as she goes inside the mall ahead. "This mall's called.." Jomi tries to read the text going left-to-right like it's an advertisement. "Lucky ManecoMart..." Jomi tilts her head in confusion. "Why lucky..?" Jomi shakes her head. "Nevermind.. Ugh.. I need to find who lightner entered this dark world.."

Jomi looks at the men casually walking. "I guarantee it's the Lightbringer.." Jomi chuckles before heading inside the mall. "Wow.. Pizza..? Chicken..? Books?! In this economy?" Jomi looks through the windows, through the overlapping advertisements, apparently it's popular enough to continue selling basic work and school tools with books. "Is this what Mijo calls the Light World..? The uh.. commodification of commons? T—though.. All I see is tech.." 

"Hm. This might be another Cyber World, where the magic inherent isn't harnessed through people's resonance but through tools.." Jomi shrugs. "To be fair.. those are literal computer programs... This just looks like those cybercities I've read in Mijo's collection of books he gives me occasionally." Jomi then suddenly pulls back as she finally searches for Mijo. "Right! Portal." 

Jomi looks around, and feels around for traces of lightner magic. "No.. not left.. right.. no.. Up..?" Jomi looks at the escalator like she hasn't seen it before. "Woah.. This is what this.. tech looks like..?" Jomi steps on it as she travels up, making her lose hold of the railings beside it. "W—what.." Jomi isn't dazed, she just wonders why it's necessary, or why doesn't it exist in her castle world yet when conveyor belts powered by Kugol' do.. but before she could finish that, she steps off as she is now at the second floor.

"Alright..." Jomi continues sensing lightner magic until she follows a trail to the.. bathroom? "O—oh..?" Jomi follows it to the female bathroom, then a specific stall until..

"Jomi!" Mijo kissed her very sloppily as Jomi was suddenly pulled in and pressed to a bathroom partition. Jomi is surprised and looks to see.. "MIJO?!" mumbled Jomi in Mijo's mouth as she pulled back, laughing. "Haha..!" Mijo smiles. "There. Better than talking about my issues." Jomi blushes as she tries to think about what the hell just happened, why did she enjoy it and why is Mijo her girl form now (which is just Jomi but more muscular and smug).

"Oh come on, princess..?" Mijo nudges Jomi until Jomi shakes her head. "Y—yes?? Y—you just kissed me! In a public bathroom?!" Jomi whisper-screamed as Mijo is still grinning and answered, "And also where I landed." Mijo points to the empty stall and the weird black ceiling above them. "O—oh..?" Jomi murmurs as somehow the light bulb above hangs from.. the weird black hole above.

"I—I see.. Though.. I—I.. don't.. make.. um.. portals in the same landing place as the lightners. W—what if..? Um.. a lot of people go to the same spot..?" Jomi looks around them. "Um.. hmm.." Jomi summons her sword and destroys the stall partition behind her to use as the portal, thankfully, no one was there. "T—that.. could've been.." Jomi sighs with relief. "Let's just.." Jomi destroys the toilet into the abyss.

"Damn, princess..?" Mijo commented. "Sh—shut up.. New things I learn.. a—and it's very draining. It's like.. if I remove something, I have to carry the same burden unless I rest for a while." Jomi thinks. "Like.. not that you'll collapse in yourself, but everything and everyone feels heavier basically." Jomi makes the portal. "A—alright. This should be the.. one to the Castle World.." Jomi looks at Mijo. "D—do you want to stay..?" 

"Nah. Let's head back.." Mijo thinks. "Though, if I exit from your world, I still exit through the bathroom dark world entrance because my bag is with me." Jomi nods. "It's fine. Thank me for that." Mijo mocks her with a kiss on the cheek and says in a too affectionate voice. "Oh my dear highest majesty, I am so grateful for—" Jomi drags Mijo into Castle World.

"H—how are _you_ this comfortable in the new body you just.. decided to use?!" Jomi comments as Mijo shrugs. "Nah actually. I kinda feel weird.. I don't know if it's the potion or.. something but yeah.." Mijo says in a more wobbly tone. "You did drink something _untested.._" said Jomi as Mijo nodded regretfully. "Man.. I like and hate this body at the same time.." Mijo says as she stumbled slightly as they headed inside the castle.

Jomi is quiet as they walk to Jomi's office, the staff around greeting the princess as she stays silent until they enter her office. "What's.. What are the side-effects?" asked Jomi, as Mijo sat down on the sofa, tired and a bit dizzy. "It's.. uh.." Mijo's clothes felt strained at her chest, and the new weight felt a bit too heavy. "You know.. the.." Mijo gestured at the chest that she's not used to but can't help but look at.

"What? Didn't you—" said Jomi before Mijo coughed loudly that Jomi stopped herself. "Y—yeah, that. It's just.." Jomi goes to her desk and gets a heart shaped empty glass bottle. "There's a.. reason you took it without question, even when it was a prototype." Mijo nodded and looked down as she said, "I guess..? L—look, just help me out here.."

"... Fine." Jomi says as she sits beside Mijo. "Just, tell me **dammit**, all the things you're feeling, right now." Jomi stands up and goes to grab her notebook from her desk. "Ugh.. I feel weirdly awful in my stomach area for some reason.." Mijo says, as she rubs it as Jomi picks the notebook up. "That is odd. You lightners usually don't use bathrooms here, what's different about this?" asked Jomi as Mijo shrugged. "I—I don't know!! You're the expert here..!"

Jomi went silent as she went to her potion room and returned with a similar potion that Mijo used. "H—here. Should.. turn you back immediately. But uh.." Jomi scratches her head. "It's.. prototypal too." Jomi looks at her notebook, hiding her eyes from Mijo. "Y—you're probably going to have to.. experience the... _after effects_ for a couple of more days." Mijo sighs and takes the potion. "Alright, alright.. I get it." Mijo stands up.

"I'll be going home anyway." Mijo shrugged. "Just wanted to see if there was a new one. As it turns out, there _is_ another _problem._" Mijo sighs. "I mean.. y—you did open one.." Jomi says as Mijo nodded in agreement. "Yeah, I know. I'm just sayin'." Mijo goes quiet then she tells Jomi, "Tomorrow, I'm going to Nuevo Leon. Be ready to _open the portal, please._" Jomi nods quietly as Mijo looks away, walks to the door, looks at Jomi again, then leaves.

_Back to the LIGHT! @ 16:30_

"Okay.. I have to—" Mijo realizes something is very wrong as her chest is now tight. "W—what.." Mijo.. is very much shocked. "N—no way.. no way.." Mijo rubs her eyes and does a double take on her own body. "I—It worked..? But.." Mijo then suddenly felt some deep, gnawing pain in her lower abdomen, like she had been stabbed there. "F—fuck?? What is this.." 

Another figurative plane has hit her pelvis this time, it throbbed with relentless, pulsing ache. It's like if jet fuel was melting and twisting her insides. Every step made Mijo gasp and involuntary whimper as she tried to process the sudden turn of events. "Can't live like this.. go back.. to.. dark world.. please..." Mijo says in fragmented shaky lines as she dragged herself to the door again so she could enter and use the emergency potion.

She busted down the door and fell face-first in the bathroom stall as she shakily stood up, holding by the tiles as she rushed to get the potion and drink it successfully. As she accidentally dropped and broke the glass as her body went back to his male form. Then afterwards, the pain slowly ebbed out, as Mijo can finally breathe and think properly.

Mijo was speechless at first, struggling to collect his thoughts as the past events were being processed. "Okay.. I.. really should speak to Jomi more about refining that potion..." Mijo looks at the potion, and sighs as he put his hands on his head and hair. "Fuuuck.. I should.. return this, even if broken.." Mijo got the shards, which were thankfully some few pieces and got up.

_Jomi's Castle, 16:45._

"Mhm.. yeah, I'm working on that, Sasha." Jomi says as she looks over documents of the weekly progress on the elemental robot now codenamed: 'Chukyn'. "I know, princess..!! It's just.. do you think it'll work..?" Sasha asks, as Jomi looks at Sasha, more serious. "Not _one hundred percent,_ but if there was.. _just_ more absorbing of the 'Strovna' machine of abyss matter into energy, I could try and wrangle the robot using the 'Lance of Сохранение (Sohranenie)' but.." 

Jomi thinks a lot more, adjusting her glasses. "It's unwieldy at it's core. I can control it, I'll need time and a _lot_ of effort.. There's also Mijo and Nuevo Leon." Sasha nods. "Right. He **just** arrived right? Well, according to Anastasia, we're expecting a _lot_ of turmoil following the third week since the Scians-Chemistra deadlock." Jomi nods and grabs the paper related. "Some.. political squabble, ugh. Not yet. But this means that people can't travel to there to find a new home, and continue the exchange of people to them as we give them free Kugol'.." Jomi sighs.

"Alright. Noted. Though, one last thing, princess, some soldiers are volunteering to go back to Nuevo Leon to fight there for their city, do you think Mijo can..?" Sasha asks, as Jomi shrugs. "He's going tomorrow.. Just, ask him when he comes back then.. You can join them, though, I'll take over abyss control in the city the time you're gone." Jomi says, as Sasha thinks, and nods. "Understood." Sasha salutes then turns to leave, but before leaving, she muttered, "Keep yourself safe, by the way, Jomi." before leaving.

Jomi doesn't manage to respond before Sasha already left. "Ugh..." Jomi slumps her head onto the table as her eyes fluttered closed. As she was about to nap on her desk, a sudden knock jolted her. "Who is it..?" Jomi adjusts her glasses. "Me, Mijo!" Jomi sighs, as Mijo came in. "Nothing much, just.. returning this." Mijo out the broken potion bottle on Jomi's messy desk. "H—huh.." Jomi says as she looks to Mijo, whom was already leaving. "Wait.." Mijo stopped and turned around. "What..?"

"Just.. Sasha and some soldiers are coming with you tomorrow, out of their own volition..." Jomi looks away. "Keep them safe, okay?" Mijo nods. "Huh, okay.. So.. Anastasia's..?" Jomi wants to correct Mijo, but she just nodded. "Sure sure.. Just leave.. I'm tired.." Mijo closed the door as Jomi finishes her speech.

_Portal to Nuevo Leon.. Next day, @ 8:00._

Mijo arrives with his sword already on his hip as he sees Sasha, with her scythe and battle uniform along with a few volunteer guards beside her. Mijo looks at them as the soldiers and Sasha salute. "Sir Mijo." Sasha greets, as Mijo nods. "Marshal Sasha. Let's go." 

The group fully heads over to the actual doorway as Jomi is right there, waiting with an unreadable expression. "You are here." Jomi turns to the portal before anyone else could greet her and opens it. "Be warned, be cautious. Someone has to defend the gateway, risk the castle be overrun by abyssal creatures." Jomi looks to Mijo. "Take over from here, I will be going." Mijo nods as Jomi walks away. "We probably just need someone to inform us of any large scale attack on the door. You three!" 

Mijo points to three soldiers. "Once we enter, I want you to stand guard. If it's too overwhelming," Mijo looks at Sasha. "Use your mobile phones. It should have enough radius for the range me and Sir Mijo are exploring." The three soldiers nod before the group headed in.

_Dark skies, unending flames.._

"Nuevo Leon." Mijo holds the hilt of his katana as he looks at the world, in chaos and disarray.
