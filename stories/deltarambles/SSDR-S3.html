<!--CHAPTER 1-->
<p id="C1"><md-block># DeltaRambles C1: Separation</md-block></p>

Mijo is walking on a cloudy day. He's in the light world in the local _freedom_ park. "It's been.. two months, huh?" Mijo looks around him, while no one around here knows his story, and he thinks, they shouldn't anyway, it still makes him feel _alone._ "I remember that day like yesterday. The cries, the laughs and the longing once we all went our separate ways.."

_Flashback._

Mijo is looking at Rhida, both in their school uniform as Rhida slowly walks away from him and the dark world opening. "I know you think higher of me, I know you all do." Mijo says to himself, as she can't hear his words from that range. "But.. I can't.. wrestle with it. These.. separations. They're all but one more bond broken for.." Mijo stops, as he looks at Rhida one more time before she turns to a corner, leaving him alone in his thoughts.

"..good?" Mijo answers, but it's shaky, he doesn't know if it's true anymore. "It's true, I got my wish, I saw you, and _and the Dark Pearl_ again." Mijo looks at his arms, legs and pink notebook, that was resting nearby along with his backpack. "I just wish it didn't take so much out of me." Mijo remembered moments, many regrets, many painful fights and many defeats only barely won. "It does make for a good adventure, I guess."

_Back to Present._

He was snapped back to reality, when he absent mindedly looked at a random girl in the park that looked just a tiny bit to Rhida. "Oh, right." Mijo shrugs. "Why am I always expecting fate to be by my side?" Mijo looks at the stage in the park, which has 'JESUS' written on its background. "I can only hope that God exists in both worlds, but.." Mijo looks away. "Then again, I probably wouldn't want to meet someone that let me almost die a bunch of times, gave me powers that hurt to use, and also.."  Mijo chuckles. "..the separations." Mijo continues walking.

_Later, at home._

"Let's continue my.. walk in there." Mijo says to himself, looking at the pink notebook. Mijo stabs it with a spare pen as the dark fountain spews out. "Got the.." Mijo checks the notebooks inside his room. "Pink for Jomi's Castle World.. Blue for Dajovy.. Purple for Nuevo Leon.. Peach for.. Compinter." Mijo nodded, as the ground collapsed and now he was free falling. "Alright.. What's the new enemy this time.." Mijo thought as he landed perfectly on the 'lightner' platform.

No Jomi was waiting for him. "Ah, right. I'm basically a part-time resident here. And.." Mijo grins. "Jomi is as busy as always." Mijo then starts walking, his full dark world form of a blue jacket and dark cyan pants. "Let's revisit something." Mijo walks to Jomi's castle as Jomi's guards meet him. "Good day, sir!" Mijo salutes them as he goes to a part of Jomi's courtyard where they put the remembrance for that version of the _Dark Pearl_ that featured **Ikari.**

'Here lies the magic-infused stone signatures of the 'Dark Pearl' as of April 11, 2025.'

_Jomi - jmmcjjaa~ 'The Princess of the Dark'_

_Mijo - Mijjcaljver 'The Lightbringer'_

_Urda - Urdnmg! 'The Wind of Golden Trees'_

_Jamise - Jmsee 'The Tides Trickster'_

_JR - JJRRB 'The Bulwark Rock'_

_Lauvielle - Lvlayaa 'The Shock Lawyer.'_

_Leviente - Lvvamg 'The Flame Defender'_

_Rhida - Rhiiadrramp 'The Ice Queen'_

_Ikari - Kaiirotut 'The Lavawalker'_

Mijo goes silent as he sees the names of his friends and where they could be now. "I have no need to.. recollect what happened here." Mijo says. "I.. have moved on." Mijo looks around the  surrounding courtyard. "At least.. I want to believe so." Mijo sighs. "I just.. wished separations weren't so.. long and reunion so.. unstable and crazy, ugh." Mijo then salutes the Dark Pearl Statue before leaving.

"I better head to the training area. Ugh, my muscles are all hurting just by crouching like this." Mijo stretches his arms. "Gotten lazy _and_ weak. Typical." Mijo then walks as he summons his original sword and unsheathes it. "I do wish I could use this outside of here.. ugh, It'll make so much more **things** easier." Mijo sighs again. He noted that. "Anyways, let's just.. get there."

Mijo walks around, he thinks the castle looks busy.. Jomi's guards moving around, staff with documents, paper, the usual government stuff. The castle seemed so big and empty before, but that was before the **first**.. and **second..** cataclysms. 'Huh, there sure are a lot of cataclysms every year or so..' Mijo thinks to himself, he wonders if Jomi is free after the workday is done but he puts it off.

Mijo goes to the training area and fiddles with the controls again. "Huh, nothing changed." Mijo mumbled, of course, he didn't really think it would but was curious to see, just in case it did. "Alright. Jomi I guess." Mijo selects Jomi Boss Battle - Medium Difficulty as the area transforms and Mijo stretches his arms and legs as he positioned himself to unleash Iaijitsu.

"Iâ€”If I have to fight you then I shall." Boss Jomi says as she charges up her sword attack. "If I remember correctly, there's an easy way to defeat this version easily." Mijo eyes Boss Jomi as she unleashes sparks of electro and walls of cryo all over the arena (the training area has become an arena) as he dodges without a single slash from Mijo. "Still got it.. ugh.." Mijo groans at the adrenaline coursing as well as the phantom pain.

"Let's end this." Mijo touched the hilt of his blade as he unleashed many slashes and even many direct cuts to ice blocks built or thrown in Mijo's direction. "You.." Mijo dodges an ice block. "shall.." Another slash to prevent blockage. "_DIE!_" Mijo unleashes his lightning attack, going into light speed to slash around as he went back to normal speed to follow up with a pyro attack using his other sword from his time in Dajovy. "Burn until I do!" Mijo unleashes red hot flames against Boss Jomi as she disintegrates.

Mijo lands as he falls to the ground on his knees being held up by the sword stabbed on the ground. "Ugh.. I keep using.. it.. it.. keeps hurting.. pain.. keeps.. me.. strong..! Mijo stands up wobbly as his swords disappear. "You're here." Mijo says to a Jomi clapping slowly. "Wow. What a great move. Though, should've just picked the realist difficulty. Not like it would've changed a damn thing, since you're soo powerful, but.. hey, so you're in the dark world.. New school year?" asked Jomi as as Mijo chuckled.
