## Summary:

The sun shines on a busy afternoon, and Mijo is once again at a precipice of a new year of darkness and light. The duality of suffering and happiness, it weaves around until it can be wrestled and used for good.

## Author's Note:

A mostly prologue dealing with the plot setting up of Season 3, I guess. Further details will be added if necessary, as edits but if not, enjoy!

— jmb~

---

Mijo is walking on a cloudy day. He's in the light world in the local _freedom_ park. "It's been.. two months, huh?" Mijo looks around him, while no one around here knows his story, and he thinks, they shouldn't anyway, it still makes him feel _alone._ "I remember that day like yesterday. The cries, the laughs and the longing once we all went our separate ways.."

_Flashback._

Mijo is looking at Rhida, both in their school uniform as Rhida slowly walks away from him and the dark world opening. "I know you think higher of me, I know you all do." Mijo says to himself, as she can't hear his words from that range. "But.. I can't.. wrestle with it. These.. separations. They're all but one more bond broken for.." Mijo stops, as he looks at Rhida one more time before she turns to a corner, leaving him alone in his thoughts.

"..good?" Mijo answers, but it's shaky, he doesn't know if it's true anymore. "It's true, I got my wish, I saw you, and _and the Dark Pearl_ again." Mijo looks at his arms, legs and pink notebook, that was resting nearby along with his backpack. "I just wish it didn't take so much out of me." Mijo remembered moments, many regrets, many painful fights and many defeats only barely won. "It does make for a good adventure, I guess."

_Back to Present._

He was snapped back to reality, when he absent mindedly looked at a random girl in the park that looked just a tiny bit to Rhida. "Oh, right." Mijo shrugs. "Why am I always expecting fate to be by my side?" Mijo looks at the stage in the park, which has 'JESUS' written on its background. "I can only hope that God exists in both worlds, but.." Mijo looks away. "Then again, I probably wouldn't want to meet someone that let me almost die a bunch of times, gave me powers that hurt to use, and also.."  Mijo chuckles. "..the separations." Mijo continues walking.

_Later, at home._

"Let's continue my.. walk in there." Mijo says to himself, looking at the pink notebook. Mijo stabs it with a spare pen as the dark fountain spews out. "Got the.." Mijo checks the notebooks inside his room. "Pink for Jomi's Castle World.. Blue for Dajovy.. Purple for Nuevo Leon.. Peach for.. Compinter." Mijo nodded, as the ground collapsed and now he was free falling. "Alright.. What's the new enemy this time.." Mijo thought as he landed perfectly on the 'lightner' platform.

No Jomi was waiting for him. "Ah, right. I'm basically a part-time resident here. And.." Mijo grins. "Jomi is as busy as always." Mijo then starts walking, his full dark world form of a blue jacket and dark cyan pants. "Let's revisit something." Mijo walks to Jomi's castle as Jomi's guards meet him. "Good day, sir!" Mijo salutes them as he goes to a part of Jomi's courtyard where they put the remembrance for that version of the _Dark Pearl_ that featured **Ikari.**

'Here lies the magic-infused stone signatures of the 'Dark Pearl' as of April 11, 2025.'

_Jomi - jmmcjjaa~ 'The Princess of the Dark'_

_Mijo - Mijjcaljver 'The Lightbringer'_

_Urda - Urdnmg! 'The Wind of Golden Trees'_

_Jamise - Jmsee 'The Tides Trickster'_

_JR - JJRRB 'The Bulwark Rock'_

_Lauvielle - Lvlayaa 'The Shock Lawyer.'_

_Leviente - Lvvamg 'The Flame Defender'_

_Rhida - Rhiiadrramp 'The Ice Queen'_

_Ikari - Kaiirotut 'The Lavawalker'_

Mijo goes silent as he sees the names of his friends and where they could be now. "I have no need to.. recollect what happened here." Mijo says. "I.. have moved on." Mijo looks around the  surrounding courtyard. "At least.. I want to believe so." Mijo sighs. "I just.. wished separations weren't so.. long and reunion so.. unstable and crazy, ugh." Mijo then salutes the Dark Pearl Statue before leaving.

"I better head to the training area. Ugh, my muscles are all hurting just by crouching like this." Mijo stretches his arms. "Gotten lazy _and_ weak. Typical." Mijo then walks as he summons his original sword and unsheathes it. "I do wish I could use this outside of here.. ugh, It'll make so much more **things** easier." Mijo sighs again. He noted that. "Anyways, let's just.. get there."

Mijo walks around, he thinks the castle looks busy.. Jomi's guards moving around, staff with documents, paper, the usual government stuff. The castle seemed so big and empty before, but that was before the **first**.. and **second..** cataclysms. 'Huh, there sure are a lot of cataclysms every year or so..' Mijo thinks to himself, he wonders if Jomi is free after the workday is done but he puts it off.

Mijo goes to the training area and fiddles with the controls again. "Huh, nothing changed." Mijo mumbled, of course, he didn't really think it would but was curious to see, just in case it did. "Alright. Jomi I guess." Mijo selects Jomi Boss Battle - Medium Difficulty as the area transforms and Mijo stretches his arms and legs as he positioned himself to unleash Iaijitsu.

"I—If I have to fight you then I shall." Boss Jomi says as she charges up her sword attack. "If I remember correctly, there's an easy way to defeat this version easily." Mijo eyes Boss Jomi as she unleashes sparks of electro and walls of cryo all over the arena (the training area has become an arena) as he dodges without a single slash from Mijo. "Still got it.. ugh.." Mijo groans at the adrenaline coursing as well as the phantom pain.

"Let's end this." Mijo touched the hilt of his blade as he unleashed many slashes and even many direct cuts to ice blocks built or thrown in Mijo's direction. "You.." Mijo dodges an ice block. "shall.." Another slash to prevent blockage. "_DIE!_" Mijo unleashes his lightning attack, going into light speed to slash around as he went back to normal speed to follow up with a pyro attack using his other sword from his time in Dajovy. "Burn until I do!" Mijo unleashes red hot flames against Boss Jomi as she disintegrates.

Mijo lands as he falls to the ground on his knees being held up by the sword stabbed on the ground. "Ugh.. I keep using.. it.. it.. keeps hurting.. pain.. keeps.. me.. strong..!" Mijo stands up wobbly as his swords disappear. "You're here." Mijo says to a Jomi clapping slowly. "Wow. What a great move. Though, should've just picked the realist difficulty. Not like it would've changed a damn thing, since you're soo powerful, but.. hey, so you're in the dark world.. New school year?" asked Jomi as as Mijo chuckled.

"Yeah." Mijo sheathes his sword. "No wonder you're training then. Must mean.. well, nothing much on my side of things, anyway.. The city.. as well as.. the other worlds are.. fine. No abyss-level threats after that Christmas." asked Jomi as she immediately moves to that topic, as Mijo nods. "I see." Mijo looks around. "I suppose I shouldn't expect every threat to come out before school." Mijo shrugs. "Last time, it took a certain empty room, and the other.. well, more.. _cold_ appearances." Mijo holds Jomi's hand.

"Ah..! Yeah. I suppose so.. A—anyways, stop holding my hand like that, let's go to my office to chill for a bit.." said Jomi as she gently moves away Mijo's hand. "Surely, you..?" Mijo laughs a bit, finding amusement in these moments. "Of **course** I have time." Mijo boops Jomi's nose making her squeak and protect her nose using her left hand. "Why would I be here? Hah." Mijo looks at the window that overlooks the area from the office. "I suppose you were watching me, huh?"

Jomi looks down. "I—I..! Yeah. Of course. L—Let's just move on.. already.." Jomi grabs Mijo's hand then drags him with her to her office, passing by many guards, staff and other people in the castle. "Woah, your castle's lively. I still remember when it was just.. you, me and Urda." Mijo comments as he looks at guards chatting as well as some staff too. "Oh yeah.. Haha.. How.. u—um.. time passes.." Jomi is bothered by some staff in something Mijo doesn't bother to process.

'Looks.. normal. I notice how Jomi doesn't ever pull away. It's.. comforting, but like.. weirdly.. I mean, she's me.. and I'm her... Can we hate ourselves, but love each other? Huh? Wait can that even.. well.. I do hate myself, but I like her, she's.. what I want to be.. It's just.. that's—' Mijo's train of thought was crashed by Jomi who was now looking at him with slight concern. "Buddy. Mijo? Knight?" Jomi called out, snapping her fingers as they were in Jomi's office conveniently.

"Yeah? I was just thinking about how to.. sneakily push you into be—" Mijo smirks as Jomi visibly flusters and looks away. "Shut." Mijo laughs. "Let's.. just sit down." said Jomi as she and Mijo sat down.

"Alright, I think I can infer a lot of what happened.. Just, give me the gist of your current.. 'eternal winter' situation." Mijo says as he looks outside. "O—oh.. yeah.. the.. Dajovy reclamation process has been.. slow.. at best." Jomi tugs on her purple blouse. "W—we just haven't seen much of a breakthrough in terms of  that elemental robot we found, and.. admittedly, the city's tense and filled up. That's why I have a lot more people in my castle.." explained Jomi as Mijo nodded.

"Ohh.. right. Your.. world is literally just your castle, and Dajovy is only like.. a city and some towns beneath?" Mijo moves his head in disappointment. "Tsk tsk.. I see. Isn't Nuevo Leon.. well.. right. That's still.. a mess. Hey, what happened there anyway?" asked Mijo, as Jomi pondered while looking at the ceiling. "Um. After the second cataclysm? Uh.. I—I guess it's like outer Dajovy in terms of desolation.. Huh. It's just.. I guess we haven't like.. thought of going back there since the Cara-Rasca fight destroyed a lot of stuff.. a—and the abyssal corruption.."

"So.. basically, you want me to go there to destroy abyssal corruption and move over some people, if I get where this is going." Mijo says. "Oh. I.. well.. I was about to say that. W—we have resonators. Sasha.. Anastasia.. But.. me and them are too important for running Dajovy to focus on Nuevo Leon. Even Sasha. Like, we can't.. umm.. well, like Nuevo Leon is hostile right? So.. there's no guarantee that we'll come back.." explained Jomi as she saddened her expression. "A—and.. as.. we've experienced.. we really can't send small-time resonators either.. risk losing them to the corruption."

"I see. So it isn't all sunshine and rainbows here.. Though rainbows are rare here.. You get my point. I guess.. I'm trading light world problems for.. dark world problems? Where a mistake could.. doom the dark world to the abyssal corruption or outside here, where I'm doomed if I don't pass." Mijo reflects. "S—small correction.. Don't you have to do both..? A—at least the group ones?" asked Jomi as Mijo sardonically laughed. "Yeah. It.. wasn't a problem until it became _HALF_ of my damn school works." Mijo shakes his head.

"Worse part is.. I can't exactly.. Well, I've never exactly tried it with others I don't know as much but.. you know? Bring them? So I can skip stuff.. _Problem_, I have to trust them enough so they won't become a problem lightner." Mijo thinks. "You know.. uh.. yeah, Deltarune?" Mijo asked Jomi. "Yeah, it's been.. in my.. memories since the first cataclysm. Um, yeah they did release two new chapters, right?" Mijo nods. "And basically, the main antagonists are the lightners since a certain knight is one of them. Basically, point is, even though abyssal monsters and people are a problem, lightners could be worse as they exist in both the light and the dark."

Jomi thought. "I—I guess you were lucky, huh?" Mijo nods. "Very much so." Mijo looks at the desk of Jomi, very disorganized with papers and a single lone PC-lookalike turned off in the middle of all the regal decorations. "Anywho.. Back to the main problem. I can solve the abyssal monster problem, but.." Mijo thinks. "I might have to do it alone. And.. I also need a way to cleanse if I find a source." Jomi looks at Mijo, half worried and half disappointed.

"I—I see.." Jomi sighs. "A—are you sure you're.. going alone?" Jomi reflects. "It's just.." Jomi keeps both of her hands to her chest. "It's just.. you know.. I can't go with you, right?" Jomi asks. "If it's not endangering Dajovy, yeah no." Mijo answers. "Right, and.. I'm not sure if anyone else but me can handle the abyssal corruption and cleansing.. But.." Jomi thinks. "I can't go.."

"Fine. I'm helping **you** first." Mijo says, a bit more firm. "How are you a leader if you can't—" Jomi interrupts with, "H—hey! Just because.. this is tough alright?!" Mijo is speechless. "Ugh.." Mijo clears his throat. "What I meant, is.. there's no way you **can** go? You went with us in every adventure, even during Nuevo Leon. What changed?" Mijo asks as Jomi looks down quietly, thinking before looking at Mijo, with a serious face. 

"It's.. a lot. Firstly, due to the growing populace.. There's some.. discontent in what I'm currently doing. Many many things have been said. Secondly, there's.. also a lot.. of.. abyssal magic that doesn't come from me. I'm guessing some people have taken matters into their own hands. Thankfully, I have some.. people that use it.. like me but.. it's.. not looking stable for me to leave for something I cannot guarantee will go smoothly. Lastly, there's been some ongoing court war on Scians-Chemistra or something, I haven't looked over.." Jomi sighs and curls up on the sofa. 

"I—It's a lot.. and.. I haven't thought much on how to.. truly solve all of it. As I can't go to Scians-Chemistra without leaving issues in Dajovy unsolved, but there's no.. existential solution. Unless it involves you lightners, or.. I guess someone as capable as me." Jomi lies down on the sofa fully as Mijo processes the situation, and also lies down on the sofa, thinking. The two are silently thinking before Mijo speaks up.

"Is there a deadline?" asked Mijo, as Jomi stutters. "U—uh.. I—I don't know. But.. it's fine.. Mijo, y—you have time. I—I think? I don't want you to.. y'know." Jomi looks at Mijo looking upwards. "I don't wanna see you hurt.. again." Mijo wryly chuckled. "Hah. Being alive _is_ painful." Mijo looked at Jomi. "It's fine. The.. previous.. breakdown I had was.. a reaction of the inexperience of destruction." Mijo closed his eyes, slightly smiling. Then he opened his eyes as he looked at Jomi, still smiling.

"I'm used to it. I just.." Mijo looks up before standing up and stretching his arms. "I just need more time to think, I guess, and.." Mijo stretches his neck. "Find some new lightners, I guess. Haha~" Mijo laughs sardonically. "But in all seriousness, I.. as much as I don't want to admit it, I do need companions." Mijo thinks. "So, I'll be chilling in-and-out of the dark world for some time. I still need to figure out more of the situation." Mijo looks out. "Will I be recognizable.. Huh, yeah I am.." 

"Hey, Jomi? You have.. uh some clothes I could borrow for walks? My outfit is.. very recognizable, and.. I might need to change sometimes." asked Mijo, as Jomi thought. "W—we can use transformation magic..?" Mijo laughs. "Then I'll be even more recognizable. Who casually forgets the face.." Mijo moves closer to Jomi. "..of my cute, beloved oppressor?" Jomi blushes. "I—I can.. um.. still use **some** other form.. Um, I—I think, I actually haven't.. tested any.. B—because..! I didn't need to! W—without my public regal clothes and some.. hair adjustments, I'm fine..!"

"Alright, so.." Mijo smirked. "You don't **have** one for me? Girlie, I thought you'd have a male or androgynous disguise..." Jomi nodded flustered. "I—I.. do! I just haven't.. used them..?" Mijo laughed. "It's fine. I.. don't need it for now." Mijo turned to the door. "I'll have some more.. reflecting to do. Stay safe, Jomi, and.." Mijo looks at Jomi again, a bit apologetic. "I'm sorry for.. calling you out.. I know you know that already. Just, be cool, hmm?" Mijo pats Jomi's head as she freezes but reluctantly lets happen before Mijo leaves.

"D—damn you and your.. charm..? I mean.. we're.. oh god, do _I_ have flirting skills I have no knowledge of?!" Jomi says as she looks at her office door.

_Mijo, in the Dajovy City Plaza._

**One of the many unspoken rules is to not disturb lightners unless you are disturbed by them, interestingly enough.**

There, in the cold yet somewhat warm plaza, after a while of simply admiring the place, Mijo sits down in one of the chairs. "Let's see.." Mijo recounts whose names he can likely reach according to what fate has brought. "Urda. She's in my class this time. With the sacrifice of.. ugh, literally _everybody else."_ Mijo looks at the reader (yes, that's _you_) unintentionally, unamused before looking away.

"It's as if god.. if they even exist, I am cursed with progression, I wanna stay stagnant with my friends, dammit." Mijo chuckled darkly. "Though.." Mijo sighs as he looks onto the people casually walking around on a fine Dajovy night, lit up with Kugol' all around, the orange hue over the white city. "We definitely had an adventure, that's for sure." Mijo looks at the massive ice-geo statue depicting an ice structure with jagged lines and straight lines being wrapped by geo rocks in Kugol'. 

"I guess.. ugh." Mijo is drifting off, listening to some random conversation, something about cervical spines or whatever. He's not paying attention to whether that makes sense or not. "The hospitals are.. yeah.. there's not enough... princess.. abyss.." said the words of whatever he can make out. "Damn. Right, of course." Mijo nods. "The people." Mijo thinks more. "What happens once I.. complete it though?" asked Mijo, looking up to the night sky, it's dotted with stars, though Mijo isn't sure whether they actually exist or not.

"I thought it was over when Cara.. presumably died that day, or when she and Rasca were vanquished at Nuevo Leon.. Now..?" Mijo sighs. "Right, as long as something exists.." Mijo stands up. "It can be remade." Mijo summons his sword. "I should've said destroyed.. But, like.. Cara is 'I always come back' or something, so that isn't true." Mijo smirked before making his sword disappear as he started walking back to the spot to the light world.

"I need to.. speak to someone, but.." Mijo stretches his arms. "It'll be a few days before then.. Let's gather as much detail." Mijo goes silent as he goes up to the light world. 

_Ikari and Mijo Conversation.. Background Photo is a random purple-ish color with a heart in the middle.._

Mijo: yo.. uh dark world?

Ikari: Dark world?? Oh yeahh what about it??

Mijo: there's going to be a lotta problems for it in the following school year, you think you can make it..?

Ikari: Maybe

Ikari: Honestly, sun probs my last free day

Mijo: I see.. But, do you think you can be called upon, just in case it spills over to the light world?

Ikari: Probs not fr, busy with GSP stuff but

Ikari: Yeah just message me and if I can I will go

Ikari: Is it open and where is the entrance

Mijo: Still thinking of some spots, used my backup world in my backpack

Ikari: Ohh okay rightrighty then just tell me so I know where to go

Mijo: Cool cool (Ikari reacted with 👍)

_Urda and Mijo Conversation.. Blank Background._

_Funny emfna..._ (Mijo): Yo. Dark world.

_Dumb idiot a..._ (Urda): Dark world

Mijo: Yes.

Urda: New boss?

Mijo: Not yet idk

Urda: Then what?

Mijo: Some problem in Nuevo Leon I need your help with

Urda: Oh yeah what happened there

Mijo: Gist is; I need help killing some abyss monsters and restoring land.

Urda: Sounds like hard work

Mijo: Ofc it is and who knows, honestly, there's like dime-a-dozen beings in that desolate place,  we might find one

Urda: Coolerino then but like when and what exactly are we doing

Mijo: Just.. speak to me in school after the usual... intros and stuff.. I actually don't know where that it's safe to talk or create one without disturbance

Mijo: But if I don't have any, just meet me somewhere near the balcony, I'm usually there chilling (Urda reacted with ❤️)

_Planning.. Hours later, June 14, 2025._

Mijo is traveling for his sister, Deciene's (shortened to Dess') boarding house for whatever college internship, he thinks. As he's riding in a bus with his parents, he's already wondering what to do with the dark world days from now. 

"Nuevo Leon.." Mijo murmurs as everyone else is sleeping. "I got a certain pirate onboard, or even the flamewalker if I'm lucky.. The thing is.." Mijo looks over his other contacts, and immediately closes it as he hovers over Rhida's name. Mijo goes silent for a while, before sighing. "I'm trying to move on, Rhida.. It's just.." Mijo looks at the winding roads and fields outside the bus' window. "I can't." Mijo scratches his head almost regretfully. "Who can replace you..?"

"Ugh. I sound like a **fucking** idiot." Mijo scoffs. "Don't I?" Mijo looks at his mother, May right beside him, sleeping and even then, couldn't hear his mumblings. "Yeah..." Mijo continues looking onwards to the endless road ahead. "I do want to believe I'm holding out for someone, but.." Mijo sighs. "It's just not the same." Mijo shakes his head. "Never is going to be. Ugh, I keep.. remembering _her._"

"I'm like those hopeless romantics in poems or writings.." Mijo mocks a voice. "Oh my hopeless romance..!" Mijo chuckles. "I want you to be the love of my life, the one to bear my children..!" Mijo slaps himself playfully on this, as he felt a bit embarrassed in saying this. Since first, he _just_ lost the love of life, and two, he doesn't even want to have children, forever. At least, that's what he keeps telling himself, even _he_ doesn't know if his **libido** is going to agree with him on this.

"Ugh, disgusting.." Mijo keeps thinking about it anyway. "What would I even say.." Mijo thought. "Am I even.. uh.." Mijo instinctively recoils. "Sexually attractive??" Mijo shakes his head. "E—even so, surely we won't.. well.. I won't be dumb enough, right?!" Mijo thinks too many times where he doubted his own stupidity and was proven right. "Fuck.. I gotta start thinking about this now, right..?" Mijo thinks. "College is where my parents met and that's basically like not that far away from me now.."

This train of thought has been fortunately derailed by a buzz from his phone. "Oh..?" Mijo looks, it's just a message from Dess' that is asking their ETA to the bus terminal at the big city, some place called 'Cubao'. "Makes sense.. I'll just reply." This got him about minutes of distractions from his thoughts as he switched topics, dissociating like a '**boss',** apparently.

_UP Diliman. 10:30. Still June 14._

Mijo is consciously (or subconsciously, he can't tell sometimes) is walking behind most of the other 'college seniors' in his immediate family, like his sister Dess, Lentz (his aunt's kid, also indirectly older sis) and Ardo, her cousin's boyfriend (?). Honestly, whatever the friend group this is supposed to be Mijo can't tell, and he thinks that this is irrelevant to the dark world anyway, so.. he once again drifts off into his own thoughts while walking the pathways of this prestigious college.

"I can't stop thinking about college." Mijo says to himself. "It's like.. a looming threat with a far-enough deadline to where I can chill a day without being harmed, but chill for too long and destroy yourself.." Mijo chuckles darkly. "Just like the dark world, wonder why.." Mijo looks at the reader (*yes, he keeps looking at you..*) **again** before looking away. "Anyway, besides the point. The dark world's easier, though."

"I have experience, if necessary I can definitely bring in new lightners to the dark world.." Mijo thinks. "My only problem is.." Mijo looks to the vast green fields of the university, a luxury for a public and popular one. "Well.." Mijo sighs. "_That_ life." Mijo doesn't know if the haze that suddenly crept into his mind is because of this, but, he's hazy in thinking so he can't process it well. "I.. have been waiting for _so long_ to end _that_ life." Mijo, even though he sees no one touch his shoulder, still feels something crawling on his skin.

"Coming back.." Mijo narrows his eyes. "..Feels _so bad._" Mijo reflects on his summer vacation. "For how many times I crashed out.." Mijo chuckles darkly. "I don't know if I'll... _feel_ like that again." Mijo crosses the 'Tau Alpha Walkway' as he looks onto stagnant waters, even more grassy fields, and concrete bridges. "Should I feel..?" Mijo thinks. "I do though." Mijo further reflects. "It's not that I don't. In fact, it I can process it, I'll definitely have a reaction, and by definition, a feeling but.."

Mijo can't shrug off something this important. "Ugh. It's.. hard to try and feel something worth if... if.." Mijo thinks to the hell that _was_ Nuevo Leon before its desolation, wars and destruction.. Constant fighting, dark or light world, he'd never stopped fighting. "_Everything else hurts._" Mijo just feels exhausted just by thinking about the months leading up to the end of that school year. He also starts to feel feelings he can't even name, something sad, something angry, something in-between..

"Fuck. I have to learn to be better." Mijo tried to taste the hollow words in his mouth. "Or.. whatever that means." Mijo looks at the trees providing shade to the campus, making sure the sun doesn't fully gaze upon his soul. "If I go to the dark world with _them again_, would it be a repeat of last time?" Mijo questions this, but he knows the answer is never clear for him. "I.. I'll have to plan first. I can't let my past interfere with my future." Mijo says, but even he doesn't believe it, he's wondering if he will _ever_ do though.

_Manila Chinatown. 12:00_

Mijo is walking in this hustling and bustling part of the city, where multiple stores congregate and coagulate into a lot of people buying, chatting, selling, waiting and whatever is to do in this fine part of the city. As for Mijo, he heavily dislikes this part of the city, not only because it's filled with many many people, but also it reminds him of Dajovy, and it's overpopulation crisis.

As his group that includes May, Dess', and Lentz go around and stop at food places, Mijo thinks as he drifts off again. "It's.. weird thinking like I'm about to die once school rolls in." Mijo thinks back to a vague dream he had on the bus ride. "It.. featured me, being left alone _again_ by Urda and Ikari for.. _various_ reasons I can't remember, but.." Mijo gets an ice cream small cup from May. "But.. it's probably something dumb like..."

Mijo starts eating the ice cream as they move again. "Outside perspective or.." Mijo looks at a person that had the same hairstyle as Urda before she disappeared. "..they moved on?" Mijo eats another scoop. "It's.. weird. I dread the day, yet it's so.." Mijo goes under a big umbrella that's held up because it was being used by a local street vendor selling dragon fruit flavored bubble tea. "...near. I guess it's because I have to do it. But, it's more than that.."

The world disappears in his mind for a minute as he starts monologuing properly. "Before.. during.. the dark world.. I was.. **never** a true leader." Mijo imagines Jomi. "She is." Mijo thinks back to the cyber world. "I only was one because of my powers. Because I felt.. powerful." Mijo imagines Jomi and Cara. "She.. used to be powerless and now powerful.. Me? I haven't been one."

Mijo imagines the Dark Pearl. "They'd all say.." Mijo sees the Dark Pearl cheering on and doing excellent maneuvers because of Mijo. "You're such a great leader, Mijo! But.." Mijo imagined himself looking at his school during one of many days of normalcy. "I never amounted to anything outside of it. In fact," Mijo sees the grades in his report card, from 1st to the 4th quarter, most middle of the road, others a complete failure. "I failed."

"But.. I'm still here aren't I?" Mijo thinks to the last meeting of him and Rhida. "Just.. not the same individual. But.. the same _circumstances_ haven't changed." Mijo looks at the gate of the school. "Same problems, same authority, and the same dread." Mijo sighs as the imaginary world shatters, the chinatown coming back to his senses. "Just another day of being me."

"Hey, Mijo~" Dess says. "Try this!" Dess shoves the boba dragon fruit mix as he reluctantly does so. Then afterwards, he commented, "It tastes like dragon fruit liquid sugary mess." Dess chuckled. "Yeah.. But it's fun!" Dess says, before turning to Lentz to talk about something Mijo couldn't overhear. "Though, there's something else." Mijo says, looking at the street then the buildings, before smiling.

_The group was eating at a local chinese restaurant. Still in Manila Chinatown. 14:30_

"I guess it's about.. me being able to experience not being myself..?" thought Mijo as he chewed on raw (no sauce)  steamed white chicken. "I'm not _exactly_ a good person in the light world.." Mijo gets more fried rice, with toppings. "I have **very** low self-confidence, looks and acts antisocial, and very nihilistic and quick to anger." Mijo pours just a bit more rice. "Also acts like a _victim_ always." Mijo doubts whether this means he feels guilty and pity for himself for blindly following or he feels guilty for feeling guilty in the first place.

"In the dark world?" Mijo chuckles. "I'm powerful, heroic and self-sacrificial." Mijo grins darkly. "Am I **truly** heroic? Or am I a savior complex self-destructive loser who only succeeded because I had the power to **actually** do my deluded fantasies?" Mijo thinks there should be a therapist for these types of talking, but then again, he thinks and wishes a lot, but most of them aren't fulfilled, whether he can do anything about it though.. that's a question he can't answer.

"Ugh. No point in thinking about this. Let's focus on the damn.. plan." Mijo sighs, before drinking his iced sweetened coffee. "It doesn't matter, if I can't.. _do_ anything about it." Mijo's force on getting another chicken tender and eating its juicy meat was a bit more forceful than usual. "Let's just.. plan. Damnit. I should just trauma dump on Jomi later, when I get home.." Mijo eats a siomai in one big chomp, getting some looks.

_Lucky Chinatown Mall. @ Matcha Tea Place 15:16_

"Alright.." Mijo is now typing on his phone. "Good places..?" Mijo thinks of the location, his classroom is somewhere in the 3rd floor, 6th according to the class GC, but he doesn't know how 'isolated' it is. "Is it.. like last grade where the room is in the middle of things? Is it on the sides? If so, are there any good spots that can be conspicuous.." Mijo further reflects, eating his ice cream from a local DQ (yes, that one..).

"Maybe.. the classroom.. that's always an option, and.. a chance, if there's a new dark world, which.. is.. not good." Mijo thinks. "I'll just have to see.." Mijo sighs. "Okay, but.. there's not a good 'permanent' spot."  Mijo thinks. "If my guess is correct, I'm in the.. that building. On the.. ugh, third floor, right? Right, so my guess.. is we.. wait, technically, I haven't been there, how will I..?" Mijo scoffs, then eats more scoops. "Fine. Let's just use my bag then, it'll be fine, for now."

"Mmmm.." Mijo appreciated his dairy queen cookies and cream ice cream for a second before getting back on topic. "Okay, once in.." Mijo reflects. "Jomi's help is unreliable.. So is Ikari's.. Urda's probably the only reliable one, but problem.." Mijo eats more. "Let's see how I do on Monday." Mijo thinks. "There's no way to plan stuff, without any foreseeable way.." Mijo eats the last scoop of ice cream. "If Urda doesn't go well, I still have to see the land for myself." Mijo nods. "That is settled, I guess."

_Let the world burn once more._

## Author's Note:

3 days.. The 3 days of.. this. Okay, let me get something out of the way, I was thinking of putting one more section about personal stuff related to Mijo, in the Venice Mall.. in the Philippines.. Manila.. No clue why it exists, but.. yeah, I wanted to have one, but.. I have pretty much exhausted the locations as well as what to say that hasn't already been said before. Anyway, we need a complete chapter and this is one of 'em. The new season needs a chapter to anchor it.

I'm not sure if I'm going to have a good progress roadmap, since school is hell, and I can't guarantee I'll have something done. 

But, as for the story and if it'll be like Season 1 or 2 in terms of pacing? It'll depend, we'll see. But, most likely: S2. But! I'm likely going to separate seasons per grading, so this will be longer in terms of chapters but same length as an S2 arc (C1-4,5-9) in the timeline... Probably. That's the plan, but my plans are always in flames, so.. anyway, that's all I got for ya, peace!

## Summary3

Mijo further regresses as he entered into the new era of dark worlds, alone as hidden enemies and new worlds await the lone lightbringer.

---

_June 16._

...

"I see." Mijo says as he looks over the bustling streets below, the wind caressing his skin. "Whatever battered hope I had," Mijo uses his right hand to feel the wind. "_has been lost to the wind._" Mijo thinks. "Why am I always expecting to be **blessed** by **fate?**" Mijo turns back, and sees familiar and unfamiliar faces, both blurring in the sea of students. "2:50. And this is where I am?" Mijo asks himself. 

_Urda and Mijo.. Hours ago, 12:30._

"Hey." Mijo says as Urda bids goodbye to her other friends as she goes up to Mijo. "Yoo..!" Urda leans to the balcony. "So.. dark world?" Mijo nods and replies, "Yeah," Mijo looks out. "It's a tough battle out there." Mijo looks at his hands. "Nuevo Leon. It's destroyed, and filled with abyss monsters." Mijo looks at Urda, with a stare worth a thousand yards. "Oh.." Urda looks away. "M—makes sense."

"It's.. not.. great there, and the works might pile up." Mijo says the cold hard truth. "I—I see." Urda looks to the rain that just started. "I still want to." Urda resolved. "But.. I need some time. I want the dark world to be accessible like during that cyber world again." Urda is concerned. "That's why, I wanted to ask if you have any places you think are great..?" Mijo thinks. "I've scoped out the building." Mijo shakes his head. "That part in time was lucky. Remember afterwards, where—"

"Yeah! I—I know and.." Urda sighs. "I—I just want it to be always open, so we can train and stuff.. Bring friends in, and.. yeah!" Urda grins. "A lot have left, let's make new ones." Urda suggests. "I'll.. think about it." Mijo looks down. "I haven't got used to the schedule yet. I'll message you when I have one. Go on, have fun." Urda nods, smiling. "Okay!! Thanks, Mijo." 

_Back to 14:50._

...

"Maybe I shouldn't.."

Mijo overhears teachers exhausted of the staircases, by the staircases. "May CR ba dito??" A male teacher asks, as the other taller one responded. "That one. It's locked though, di ko alam bakit." Mijo smiles darkly. "What a coincidence." Mijo goes back to his classroom and grabs his backpack, then gets the necessary things. "Pen.. notebooks.." Mijo then opens the backpack.

He looked around, and.. slightly 'nudged' (pushed very hard) to the door and it somehow opened. A dark world. "No fucking wonder." Mijo breathes very heavily before jumping in. His backpack and other bags dissolve as his sword appears. He lands in a very dark world, so dark that only the flames in his sword light the way.

"Alright." Mijo fires fire slices to light the way, eventually finding a path that leads to a light just in the very far corner that he ran very fast to stand at as he notices a switch. "Bathroom.. switch? Weird." Mijo flicks it anyway as lights flicker open, lighting the very dark now visible mall around him. Before he could say a word, suddenly people appear as they shop around and walk and sit down to talk, it seems like a normal mall.

"Oh?" Mijo exclaimed. "This must be a new dark world." Mijo thought. "Fuck. Where am I.." Mijo starts walking around as his sword disappears to blend in with the crowd. He walks around, seeing some appliance store, some knicks-and-knacks store, an arcade, a department store and a general shop for things that can be used for D.I.Y. stuff. "Wow.. sure looks familiar.." Mijo thinks of the store in his light world, eerily familiar but in different contexts.

"Wait." Mijo rushes to the bathroom, the male first, but does not find what he's looking for. He sighs and looks around before switching to a female form using a potion Jomi gave him during the farewell party of the second iteration of the Dark Pearl. "Wow~ Ugh.. shit why is this so.. huh?" Mijo looks down, it's done but.. damn, did Jomi literally just..? Nevermind. "I—I.. okay?" Mijo goes to the female bathroom and goes to each stalls discreetly before finding the.. empty one that looks like the light world exit.

"I wonder how.." Mijo shakes _her_ head. "Nevermind. It's a dark world. Let's explore the rest.. later..?" Mijo thinks. "Let's just find a good portal spot for Jomi. Speaking of which, she says she has the same feeling whenever a dark world opens up so.. I bet she's somewhere here." Mijo laughs and clasps _her_ hands. "Let's prank the shit out of her."

_Jomi POV._

"Wow.. so this is.." Jomi tries to read the sign. "Manecony.." Jomi is surprised by the advertisement that pops up on the sign and hides her face in the embarrassment as she goes inside the mall ahead. "This mall's called.." Jomi tries to read the text going left-to-right like it's an advertisement. "Lucky ManecoMart..." Jomi tilts her head in confusion. "Why lucky..?" Jomi shakes her head. "Nevermind.. Ugh.. I need to find who lightner entered this dark world.."

Jomi looks at the men casually walking. "I guarantee it's the Lightbringer.." Jomi chuckles before heading inside the mall. "Wow.. Pizza..? Chicken..? Books?! In this economy?" Jomi looks through the windows, through the overlapping advertisements, apparently it's popular enough to continue selling basic work and school tools with books. "Is this what Mijo calls the Light World..? The uh.. commodification of commons? T—though.. All I see is tech.." 

"Hm. This might be another Cyber World, where the magic inherent isn't harnessed through people's resonance but through tools.." Jomi shrugs. "To be fair.. those are literal computer programs... This just looks like those cybercities I've read in Mijo's collection of books he gives me occasionally." Jomi then suddenly pulls back as she finally searches for Mijo. "Right! Portal." 

Jomi looks around, and feels around for traces of lightner magic. "No.. not left.. right.. no.. Up..?" Jomi looks at the escalator like she hasn't seen it before. "Woah.. This is what this.. tech looks like..?" Jomi steps on it as she travels up, making her lose hold of the railings beside it. "W—what.." Jomi isn't dazed, she just wonders why it's necessary, or why doesn't it exist in her castle world yet when conveyor belts powered by Kugol' do.. but before she could finish that, she steps off as she is now at the second floor.

"Alright..." Jomi continues sensing lightner magic until she follows a trail to the.. bathroom? "O—oh..?" Jomi follows it to the female bathroom, then a specific stall until..

"Jomi!" Mijo kissed her very sloppily as Jomi was suddenly pulled in and pressed to a bathroom partition. Jomi is surprised and looks to see.. "MIJO?!" mumbled Jomi in Mijo's mouth as she pulled back, laughing. "Haha..!" Mijo smiles. "There. Better than talking about my issues." Jomi blushes as she tries to think about what the hell just happened, why did she enjoy it and why is Mijo her girl form now (which is just Jomi but more muscular and smug).

"Oh come on, princess..?" Mijo nudges Jomi until Jomi shakes her head. "Y—yes?? Y—you just kissed me! In a public bathroom?!" Jomi whisper-screamed as Mijo is still grinning and answered, "And also where I landed." Mijo points to the empty stall and the weird black ceiling above them. "O—oh..?" Jomi murmurs as somehow the light bulb above hangs from.. the weird black hole above.

"I—I see.. Though.. I—I.. don't.. make.. um.. portals in the same landing place as the lightners. W—what if..? Um.. a lot of people go to the same spot..?" Jomi looks around them. "Um.. hmm.." Jomi summons her sword and destroys the stall partition behind her to use as the portal, thankfully, no one was there. "T—that.. could've been.." Jomi sighs with relief. "Let's just.." Jomi destroys the toilet into the abyss.

"Damn, princess..?" Mijo commented. "Sh—shut up.. New things I learn.. a—and it's very draining. It's like.. if I remove something, I have to carry the same burden unless I rest for a while." Jomi thinks. "Like.. not that you'll collapse in yourself, but everything and everyone feels heavier basically." Jomi makes the portal. "A—alright. This should be the.. one to the Castle World.." Jomi looks at Mijo. "D—do you want to stay..?" 

"Nah. Let's head back.." Mijo thinks. "Though, if I exit from your world, I still exit through the bathroom dark world entrance because my bag is with me." Jomi nods. "It's fine. Thank me for that." Mijo mocks her with a kiss on the cheek and says in a too affectionate voice. "Oh my dear highest majesty, I am so grateful for—" Jomi drags Mijo into Castle World.

"H—how are _you_ this comfortable in the new body you just.. decided to use?!" Jomi comments as Mijo shrugs. "Nah actually. I kinda feel weird.. I don't know if it's the potion or.. something but yeah.." Mijo says in a more wobbly tone. "You did drink something _untested.._" said Jomi as Mijo nodded regretfully. "Man.. I like and hate this body at the same time.." Mijo says as she stumbled slightly as they headed inside the castle.

Jomi is quiet as they walk to Jomi's office, the staff around greeting the princess as she stays silent until they enter her office. "What's.. What are the side-effects?" asked Jomi, as Mijo sat down on the sofa, tired and a bit dizzy. "It's.. uh.." Mijo's clothes felt strained at her chest, and the new weight felt a bit too heavy. "You know.. the.." Mijo gestured at the chest that she's not used to but can't help but look at.

"What? Didn't you—" said Jomi before Mijo coughed loudly that Jomi stopped herself. "Y—yeah, that. It's just.." Jomi goes to her desk and gets a heart shaped empty glass bottle. "There's a.. reason you took it without question, even when it was a prototype." Mijo nodded and looked down as she said, "I guess..? L—look, just help me out here.."

"... Fine." Jomi says as she sits beside Mijo. "Just, tell me **dammit**, all the things you're feeling, right now." Jomi stands up and goes to grab her notebook from her desk. "Ugh.. I feel weirdly awful in my stomach area for some reason.." Mijo says, as she rubs it as Jomi picks the notebook up. "That is odd. You lightners usually don't use bathrooms here, what's different about this?" asked Jomi as Mijo shrugged. "I—I don't know!! You're the expert here..!"

Jomi went silent as she went to her potion room and returned with a similar potion that Mijo used. "H—here. Should.. turn you back immediately. But uh.." Jomi scratches her head. "It's.. prototypal too." Jomi looks at her notebook, hiding her eyes from Mijo. "Y—you're probably going to have to.. experience the... _after effects_ for a couple of more days." Mijo sighs and takes the potion. "Alright, alright.. I get it." Mijo stands up.

"I'll be going home anyway." Mijo shrugged. "Just wanted to see if there was a new one. As it turns out, there _is_ another _problem._" Mijo sighs. "I mean.. y—you did open one.." Jomi says as Mijo nodded in agreement. "Yeah, I know. I'm just sayin'." Mijo goes quiet then she tells Jomi, "Tomorrow, I'm going to Nuevo Leon. Be ready to _open the portal, please._" Jomi nods quietly as Mijo looks away, walks to the door, looks at Jomi again, then leaves.

_Back to the LIGHT! @ 16:30_

"Okay.. I have to—" Mijo realizes something is very wrong as her chest is now tight. "W—what.." Mijo.. is very much shocked. "N—no way.. no way.." Mijo rubs her eyes and does a double take on her own body. "I—It worked..? But.." Mijo then suddenly felt some deep, gnawing pain in her lower abdomen, like she had been stabbed there. "F—fuck?? What is this.." 

Another figurative plane has hit her pelvis this time, it throbbed with relentless, pulsing ache. It's like if jet fuel was melting and twisting her insides. Every step made Mijo gasp and involuntary whimper as she tried to process the sudden turn of events. "Can't live like this.. go back.. to.. dark world.. please..." Mijo says in fragmented shaky lines as she dragged herself to the door again so she could enter and use the emergency potion.

She busted down the door and fell face-first in the bathroom stall as she shakily stood up, holding by the tiles as she rushed to get the potion and drink it successfully. As she accidentally dropped and broke the glass as her body went back to his male form. Then afterwards, the pain slowly ebbed out, as Mijo can finally breathe and think properly.

Mijo was speechless at first, struggling to collect his thoughts as the past events were being processed. "Okay.. I.. really should speak to Jomi more about refining that potion..." Mijo looks at the potion, and sighs as he put his hands on his head and hair. "Fuuuck.. I should.. return this, even if broken.." Mijo got the shards, which were thankfully some few pieces and got up.

_Jomi's Castle, 16:45._

"Mhm.. yeah, I'm working on that, Sasha." Jomi says as she looks over documents of the weekly progress on the elemental robot now codenamed: 'Chukyn'. "I know, princess..!! It's just.. do you think it'll work..?" Sasha asks, as Jomi looks at Sasha, more serious. "Not _one hundred percent,_ but if there was.. _just_ more absorbing of the 'Strovna' machine of abyss matter into energy, I could try and wrangle the robot using the 'Lance of Сохранение (Sohranenie)' but.." 

Jomi thinks a lot more, adjusting her glasses. "It's unwieldy at it's core. I can control it, I'll need time and a _lot_ of effort.. There's also Mijo and Nuevo Leon." Sasha nods. "Right. He **just** arrived right? Well, according to Anastasia, we're expecting a _lot_ of turmoil following the third week since the Scians-Chemistra deadlock." Jomi nods and grabs the paper related. "Some.. political squabble, ugh. Not yet. But this means that people can't travel to there to find a new home, and continue the exchange of people to them as we give them free Kugol'.." Jomi sighs.

"Alright. Noted. Though, one last thing, princess, some soldiers are volunteering to go back to Nuevo Leon to fight there for their city, do you think Mijo can..?" Sasha asks, as Jomi shrugs. "He's going tomorrow.. Just, ask him when he comes back then.. You can join them, though, I'll take over abyss control in the city the time you're gone." Jomi says, as Sasha thinks, and nods. "Understood." Sasha salutes then turns to leave, but before leaving, she muttered, "Keep yourself safe, by the way, Jomi." before leaving.

Jomi doesn't manage to respond before Sasha already left. "Ugh..." Jomi slumps her head onto the table as her eyes fluttered closed. As she was about to nap on her desk, a sudden knock jolted her. "Who is it..?" Jomi adjusts her glasses. "Me, Mijo!" Jomi sighs, as Mijo came in. "Nothing much, just.. returning this." Mijo out the broken potion bottle on Jomi's messy desk. "H—huh.." Jomi says as she looks to Mijo, whom was already leaving. "Wait.." Mijo stopped and turned around. "What..?"

"Just.. Sasha and some soldiers are coming with you tomorrow, out of their own volition..." Jomi looks away. "Keep them safe, okay?" Mijo nods. "Huh, okay.. So.. Anastasia's..?" Jomi wants to correct Mijo, but she just nodded. "Sure sure.. Just leave.. I'm tired.." Mijo closed the door as Jomi finishes her speech.

_Portal to Nuevo Leon.. Next day, @ 8:00._

Mijo arrives with his sword already on his hip as he sees Sasha, with her scythe and battle uniform along with a few volunteer guards beside her. Mijo looks at them as the soldiers and Sasha salute. "Sir Mijo." Sasha greets, as Mijo nods. "Marshal Sasha. Let's go." 

The group fully heads over to the actual doorway as Jomi is right there, waiting with an unreadable expression. "You are here." Jomi turns to the portal before anyone else could greet her and opens it. "Be warned, be cautious. Someone has to defend the gateway, risk the castle be overrun by abyssal creatures." Jomi looks to Mijo. "Take over from here, I will be going." Mijo nods as Jomi walks away. "We probably just need someone to inform us of any large scale attack on the door. You three!" 

Mijo points to three soldiers. "Once we enter, I want you to stand guard. If it's too overwhelming," Mijo looks at Sasha. "Use your mobile phones. It should have enough radius for the range me and Sir Mijo are exploring." The three soldiers nod before the group headed in.

_Dark skies, unending flames.._

"Nuevo Leon." Mijo holds the hilt of his katana as he looks at the world, in chaos and disarray. "Where should we go, Mijo?" asked Sasha as Mijo was still looking around. "We should clear the ruins around. Sasha, once we are done here, get dendro resonators to heal the surroundings. I suspect the reasons for this are abyssal clots dotted around the world. Let's go find the sources." Mizo looks at two guards, "Stay and defend. Call for backup if need be." 

"Sir yes sir!" The guards positioned around as Mizo nodded and headed with Sasha and other guards further from the gate.

"I see one." Mizo looks to their right, an abyss clot swarmed with monsters. "Heh. Let's kill it!!" Sasha shouted as she summoned her scythe. The two moved.

"Purge all evil!" Mizo shouts as he unsheathes his sword, and decimates monsters with each lightning slash he does. Meanwhile, Sasha and the guards are smashing the stragglers, the guards using a mix of physical attacks and slight elemental use. Sasha fights and fights until she notices a certain regal queen arrive. "Cara— Mijo!!" Sasha shouted as Mijo immediately turned to the right as he clashed blades with Cara.

"Miss me?" Cara taunts as she dodges through phasing when she feels a sword behind her. "Hmph. You're back again." Mijo says as he pointed the blade at Cara. "Do know I still have the ability to eliminate you again." Mijo's electricity around him intensified. "Oh don't worry, I'm not here to.. interrupt this." Cara gestures to the fight. "I was.. also looking around, but.. ah, what do you know, I can't hide this forever." Cara smiles.

"Looking.. for?" Mijo asked, as his electricity is basically one flick away from being launched at Cara, and overwhelming her with his magic. "The new abyssal boss here, of course!" Cara smirked as Mijo sighed. "Of course. So, did you find it?" Cara shrugged. "No.. They're hiding from me. Bastard, I am their queen after all." Cara flicks her hair. "Anyway.. that clear? I am going to go and continue.. Have fun.. ahem, fixing your mess~!" Cara says before Mijo launched a devastating slash that destroyed ruined buildings and the ground below but Cara already dissipated in purple mist.

"The mess was caused when we defeated them." Mijo clarifies as he sighs. "Ugh. I have no time to explain it. I'm sure Jomi can, let's just go and take care of the abyss clot and then.. start some reconstruction, finally." Mijo explains, before looking at the destroyed abyss clot. "Haha.. she was standing in front of it. Funny.. Anyways, that's it right?" Sasha comments as Mijo nodded. "Let's take care of stragglers and get back already." Mijo commands before they continue.

_Later.. @ Jomi's Office.. 13:00._

"Thank God we're finally done with that.." Jomi sits on the sofa. "Aren't you god in this world?" Mijo smugly asked. "W—well, yes... I did merge the two worlds.. connected them.. and reconstructed.. T—there could be a higher being y'know! I just.. acquired a bunch, of power. A—anyways!! Not the point.. It was exhausting to move that portal to make it near the Silver Guard Base.." Jomi sighs. "Oh, uh.. it's.. going well, the.. dendro guys and gals. It's just.. there's been a lot of injuries on our side."

"I only cleared one part out, how big is this.. base in Nuevo Leon?" asked Mijo, as Jomi thought. "Uhhh.. like.. about.." Jomi grabs her notebook. "Umm.. around like.. uh.." Jomi finds her notes. "Around 100 meters." Jomi says, as Mijo looks at her unamused. "How big is that." Jomi quickly finds another notebook. "Like.. imagine this office, but like.. two times bigger??" Mijo nods, satisfied. "It's not that big, then." 

"Y—yeah.. But hey it's progress! Nuevo Leon is about.. um.. haha.." Jomi laughs awkwardly as she looks at her notes. "Right.. much more.. l—let's just.. uh.. wait, I can't rest, umm.. you.. go.. and uh.. rest or something." Jomi stands up as she goes outside in a rush.

Mijo sighs. "Ugh.." Mijo stretches his arms. "This is going to be.. a _long_.. month."

_Next week, around 16:00._

"What's the situation?" asked Mijo to Jomi as he entered her office and saw Jomi sleeping on the couch, completely messy, her hair tangled up on the sofa and her royal dress is very used, forming crinkles. "It's almost.. ugh. Okay." mumbled Mijo to himself before sitting on the sofa and stirring Jomi up. "Mijo..??" Jomi's eyes open up as she sees Mijo beside her brushing her hair.

"Your hair's a fuckin mess." responded Mijo as Jomi jolted awake, making Mijo stop. "A—ah—! Don't—! I was just.." Jomi shook her head. "U—um.. I mean.. Yeah, I—I was sleeping." Mijo sighs and just gets to the point. "What's the situation in Nuevo Leon?" asked Mijo as Jomi gasped. "Um.. uh.. let's see.." Jomi grabbed her notebook, again.

"Nuevo Leon's Reclamation has been slow, but steady. Though, we detected that some areas have higher levels of abyssal corruption." Jomi clears her throat. "It might've been.. uh.. Cara's work, but yeah. The boss thing she mentioned.. that you said she said, we don't know if she's not lying. We haven't explored outside of a few key outposts." Jomi adjusts her glasses. "Manecony has been in business as usual, I've.. explored it weekly, looks like no one has seen the portal."

"So nothing?" Mijo asked. "Y—yes. It almost seems like something only happens when lightners come here." said Jomi, as Mijo tilted his head. "Tch, what about the population crisis?" asked Mijo as Jomi sighed. "I meant.. new.. events." clarified Jomi, as she looked at Mijo awkwardly. Mijo was silent for a while, before standing up. "Any other news I should know?"

"U—um.." Jomi checks her notebook, "Uh.. the.. robot.." Jomi looks at Mijo, then down, pressing her hands to her thighs. "It's.. going.. fine..?" said Jomi as she looked at the window, overlooking Dajovy. "At least there's.. progress now, based on testing but.." Jomi twiddles with her hair, ".. it'd take.. at least months before the.. _new_ energy stabilizes." Jomi looks at Mijo, awkwardly smiling. "And what's this energy powering it?" Mijo directly asks, as Jomi looks down and sighs.

_"Abyssal energy."_

Mijo is not surprised, but is somewhat curious. "How do you take something corrupting, and.. turn it into energy, princess?" asked Mijo, sitting down, and getting somewhat uncomfortably close to Jomi. "I—I.." Jomi tried to move away, but Mijo's glare forced her to reconsider. "It's nothing much really.. it's—" Jomi's breathing quickens, "What I've known when I was with Cara, a—and it just got to.. a point where I knew that without my.. use of it, it'd probably take.. years.. a—and at first, that was fine, but with how the population has been.. slowly growing—"

"PLEASE—!" Jomi surprises Mijo slightly by pushing him slightly away. "I— swear!! It's nothing to do with Cara or— Rasca even!! It's.. my own will... unfortunately." Jomi's cryo is flaring around her. "Hm." Mijo holds Jomi's hand, making her gasp. "Being worried means you're still you. But.." Mijo inspects Jomi's abyss magic corruption level. "..it just manifests differently. You're always tired, aren't you?"

Jomi is shaking but nods. "Y—yeah I—I know it's because of the crises and.. this.. controlled yet powerful use, I know.." Mijo pulls back, as he sighs. "Look, I'm not exactly mad, but I'm worried about the people, they might see you're using it, and conclude that they must accelerate it." Jomi shook her head fervently. "I—I swear—! Only Anastasia and Sasha know— blame them if it gets out! I just.. I—I really want to save this world, and with just a few more sacrifices, I can..!"

_"You're just like me."_ 

Jomi freezes (not literally) as she's breathless. "Bound by duty, yet.. still me." Mijo brushes her hair, getting closer. "A princess, yet still.." Mijo's lips brush hers before he pulls back. ".. undoubtedly me." Mijo looks away, "I've always wondered why you didn't.. resist much to my advances.." Jomi is speechless and slightly blushing. "Then.. I realized, you.. wouldn't stop me, anyway. Just.. help me, like.. I would do with my own.. love."

Jomi's voice goes quieter. "I'm.. tired, Mijo.." She starts crying. "I... don't want the.. pain of having to do this, but I _HAVE_ to. I have to deal with the corruption, the hiding, just so with some force, just maybe, maybe I can restore some frozen streets, houses or beyond the snowy plains.." Jomi embraced Mijo, now getting him slightly uncomfortable. "Cara.. she's.. she was conniving, manipulative, even abusive sometimes.. But, I.."

_"I still remember why we were together."_

"The.. history she buried in herself, the.." Jomi pulls back slightly, adjusting her glasses. "I've.. actually talked with her." Mijo's eyes widened. "What?! After the first cataclysm?? As friends??" questioned Mijo as he instinctively got closer, making Jomi move back slightly in fear. "I—It wasn't much.. I just.. accidentally met her during the Dark Pearl's Christmas Party last year." Jomi was looking around, but not Mijo. "She's in disguise in the city. I'm the only one that knows she and Rasca are hiding out."

"..and now you do too. Please. Whatever you do, don't try to find them. I swear, they've only been good to me. I just can't find the time to meet up with them." Jomi sighs. "I won't tell you more than that. I.. don't.. want to." Mijo tilts his head, "Hm? Why?" Jomi's wiping away her tears. "I just don't want to provoke them. I swear, they don't know more than everyone else on stuff I've been doing." Jomi looks at her notebook. "You.. understand?" 

Mijo sighs, brushing his own hair. "Ugh, fine. I'm not you. I'm not the leader of the country the local terrorists are residing in." Jomi awkwardly chuckles. "They're.. technically.. yes.  But, I've.. um.. I'm going to see if the abyssal magic among the populace is their fault or not. I—I don't trust them completely—they just don't want to harm me, for some reason." Mijo huffs. "Maybe because you're using abyss magic, like they've been baiting you to do?"

"Maybe??? It's still the only way." Jomi sighs. "I've tried, okay?? A—and if you judge me for it, you should go and reclaim more Nuevo Leon land, it's still struggling." said Jomi as Mijo went closer again, kissing her on the cheeks. "Sure, but first you have to reward me with a functional transformation potion. One that doesn't immediately make my new uterus bleed out as soon as I use it in the light world." Jomi is speechless and currently processing the kiss before answering, "I'll see.. what I can do.. But you'll still do it, right?"

Mijo smirks, before it fades into seriousness. "Yeah. Though, I won't always be available, again... Shit to do, whatever." Jomi nods, "Okay.." Jomi looks at Mijo again, concerned. "Are you.. not going to ask why it happens..?" Mijo shrugs. "No, not yet anyway. I'm too busy—lazy? To understand how it exactly sheds my linings, just that it shouldn't do that— or at least not that painful." Jomi nods.

Mijo stands up. "Anyways, I was about to leave but then we got intimate." Jomi immediately stands up too, flustered. "Huh??????? You're the one initiating it, why are YOU complaining?" Mijo laughs. "Because it's fun seeing how you react, obviously." Jomi scoffs. "A—and you're treating me like I'm just some woman you go to dump your desires to and leave??" Mijo is amused but backs off. "Okay okay, I'll be a bit more considerate.. Also, that line is weirdly se—"

"I—I didn't mean it that— Just go!" Jomi brushes off her clothes. "I will. Plan the tomorrow Nuevo León operations for me, okay my dear beloved o' majesty princess Jomi?" Mijo leaves, the door closing hard before Jomi could answer. "Ugh.." Jomi sits down. "I need.. to sleep." She shakes her head before going to go and clean her office.

_Another next week.. 15:00._

"Sasha, can I take an early break..?" Jomi slumps on her chair as Sasha shrugs. "You're the princess, princess. Just.. do it?" answered Sasha as Jomi groaned. "I know.. I know..!! I just.. want someone to like.. watch over me or something...?" Jomi shrugged. "Like.. you get it, right?" 

Anastasia arrives. "Princess, reports of Nuevo Leon's reclamation have been successful, but there appears to be someone stopping it.. Uses of abyss magic have prevented us from intervening.. much." Sasha looks at Anastasia, "Oh that." then at Jomi. "I was about to mention it, but you look so exhausted already." Jomi narrows her eyes as she processes the information. "I.. see." Jomi stands up and stretches her arms. "I.. have to go out, and inspect this myself." Jomi walks to her bedroom.

"You two may take necessary actions to contain the threat, I'll have to go and neutralize it myself." said Jomi before fully entering her bedroom. Sasha and Anastasia look at each other. "Hah. I'll deal with the mess myself," Sasha summons her scythe. "Whatever it is, I have to.. ahem, contain it." Anastasia nods. "Sure, Sasha.. just don't be reckless, you gotta be alive for tonight." Sasha smirks, "Oh sure, guardian, what are YOU doing?" Anastasia looks to the window, smiling. "I'm going to go and inspect some abyss magic surges, and manage the people's.. panic."

_"ALRIGHT! LET'S GOOOO!"_

**_Later.. 15:30.**

"She should be here." Jomi says, in disguise. She is walking up to a particular home far out from her castle, but also in a somewhat elevated position. "Come on.." Jomi summons her sword, and hides it before knocking. "Ms. Raca, Ms. Tima? Are you there? I'm.. Ms.. Jima." No response, then Jomi hears someone walking, looks through the eyehole then opens the door.

_Rasca._

"Yes, this is.. Ms. Tima. Ms. Raca is currently out for.." Rasca loons behind Jomi and around her, random people casually walking. "..undisclosed purposes. Come on in, miss." Rasca brings Jomi in before closing the door, then enchanting the door with anti-surveillance magic, no one can hear outside, no one can hear the inside. "Hm." Rasca eyes Jomi walking and sitting on the couch. "I didn't come here for nothing, doctor." said Jomi, as she summoned her sword. "Where is she?"

"Oh?" Rasca summons her tablet. "And might I ask why, princess?" asked Rasca, as she looks at Jomi intensely. "You know why." Jomi stands up, holding her sword's sheath tightly. "Hah, well sit down, lass." Rasca puts her hand on Jomi's shoulder, making Jomi flinch but sit down anyway. "A certain queen is battling a war against threats to her power..." Rasca muses as she sits down on the armchair in front of Jomi. "It just so happens that she found external.. interference, influencing it."

_"Do you know of a dark knight, named Arlen?"_

_Nuevo León. 15:45._

"Found your refuge, knight?" Cara clashes blades with Arlen. "Ahaha.. yes, queen. This is fully the abyss' order now." Arlen launches dark knives as Cara slashes each and every one. "Haha, the abyss order? And what exactly is this? _Usurper?_" responded Cara as she launched rotating blades in front of her, Arlen dodging it. "Taking your power, _queen._" Arlen launches slashes that Cara manages to dodge, but she's grazed on her left shoulder.

"Heh, didn't know you'd be this hungry, Arlen, but just know.." Cara's left eye glowed purple. "You will never win as long as _he's_ here." Cara dissipates with a purple mist, as Arlen scoffs. "No matter, with just a bit more time.. I will win over Mijo. That _lightbringer_ shall burn out soon enough."

_Cara-Rasca's house.. at Dajovy. 16:00._

"Arlen..? What does he want?" Jomi asks as Rasca laughs. "Power, power to make Nuevo Leon the abyss' base of operations, and take over the world with darkness darker than dark." Jomi tilts her head. "I—is that possible?" asked Jomi, as Rasca checked her tablet. "See, while there's the light and dark worlds, due to the more magical nature of our world, rules can be bent. With enough power, you'll be able to reshape worlds.." Jomi gasps.

"Yes.. princess, what you did during your 'win' against the dearest queen the first time." explained Rasca as Jomi nodded. "I see. How'd Arlen rise, anyway?" asked Jomi, as Rasca pondered, putting her tablet down. "See, we're darkners right?" Rasca looks at her hands. "But here's the thing about certain abyss magic users, they've been completely consumed by it." Rasca looks at Jomi. "That's why she separated you from herself, princess and why.."

Cara opens the door and closes it, sparking and wounded.

"..she maintains a synthetic body."

"Oh hey, Tima.. and.." Cara does a double take. "Jomi? Oh my Jomi, you've returned?" Cara immediately taunted, as Jomi glares. "Shut up. I know what you're doing now." Jomi stands up. "Mind telling me why didn't you inform me of your abyss excursions in Nuevo León?" questioned Jomi as Cara chuckled. "Oh darling, why'd I tell you? You were soo busy in that little robot of yours..?" Cara coos as Rasca stands up as she notices Jomi had partially drawn her blade.

"Stand down you two." said Rasca, as she summoned RoyalCo. "Dear queen, stop taunting the poor princess over here, she's currently worried about Arlen's expeditions." Rasca goes and makes Cara sit down as Cara grumbles. "Fiiine. We'll get serious.." Cara slumps on the other couch beside Jomi as Rasca sighs and grabs her tablet. "Answer me, Cara." said Jomi, sitting down.

"In short, someone's being a little abyss parasite and I need to kill him to maintain my power." said Cara, as Rasca was now healing Cara. The healing magic Rasca was using makes Cara dazed from Manecony."

"That.. comes from me, hun! The guy's been very good but gets sloppy." brags Cara before being startled at a particular pain point. "And.. the abyss magic use in the populace?" asked Jomi as the two looked at her amused. "Ahh.. princess, abyss magic is such a hidden market, I myself have looked over what these fools have been using our magic for.. They're also trying to save Dajovy through any means necessary.." Cara tries to get up but Rasca holds her down by the arms. "Hey..! Ugh, fine." 

_"Get to work, princess, oh and that lightbringer..? Make sure he succeeds in defeating that usurper scum~"_

_Jomi's office. 16:30._

"Good, but I don't think that's the end of it. Just, stay alert, okay you two?" said Jomi to Anastasia and Sasha before they left.

**Mijo arrives.**

"Oh hey you're here." Mijo jumps and lays down on the couch casually. "I—I was handling something." Jomi goes and sits on the couch in front of Mijo. "Yeah, I was told you were handling something abyss related." Mijo yawns. "I went to Nuevo Leon and helped Sasha.. Then expand the reclamation zone a bit more.." Jomi nods. "So, like.. did you find anything? Sasha said you were in some sort of hidden mission?" asked Mijo as Jomi looked down and deliberated.

"I have.. found out that the boss Cara was hunting is real.. and that he's super dangerous."  said Jomi as she looked at Mijo. "He only appears when he needs to." said Jomi, as she shifted in her position. "Oh? So a coward?" said Mijo jokingly as he got up. "Make a plan, bait the mothertrucker— then I unleash Lightbringer's Dawn on 'im.. BOOM!" 

"Ahaha.. t—that would be nice. I—I will see what I can do." said Jomi as Mijo huffed. "Huh, what's that look on your face? Why so nervous?" Mijo got closer and bent down to be face level with Jomi. "I—It's nothing..." Jomi brushed her hair. "I swear, Mijo. I'm just.. um.." Jomi looks at her table. "B—busy!" Mijo looks at the table then at Jomi, staring deep into her eyes as she follows, a bit.. more hesitant before Mijo kisses her and pulls back.

"I'll believe it." Mijo stretches his arms and legs. "I gotta go home anyway. Peace, the princess of all~" Mijo waves goodbye before leaving the office. "What.. does he mean by.. _it_?" Jomi thinks as she sighs and stands up to organize her table. "W—whatever it is.. I—if he ever has any complaint, he'll.. be.. blunt. Right..?" Jomi spoke to herself, trying to reassure whatever Mijo did.

For Jomi, the kiss felt it was.. a bit out of character for Mijo to keep doing, especially since Manecony, but Jomi just sighed, she knew that whatever Mijo was thinking, it.. couldn't be dragged out of him anyway.

## Author's Note:

So, this stage of Mijo's development is done! As of right now, @ 16:34.. With around 7%, I am writing this.. author's note. So, hello! It's been a while since the last few commentaries, right? Yeah, it.. just gets that way, honestly. Being such a downer throughout this process, I wondered what is the future of this novel..? The answer? I don't know.

Anywho, at least this one finished at somewhat good time. But, to be fair, it's short, at least, compared to my longest. @ ~6089 words. Which.. again, I'd usually go for lower but I think this is fine. The chapters will definitely vary in length, that's for sure. Sometimes, a chapter needs more or less than the average, depending on the story elements.

At 4%.. That's all I wanted to say, stay tuned for.. 'Tired of Dreaming', Chapter 3 Season 3, and goodbye, see you and good day~!

_Another week has passed.. July 18._

Mijo is sat on a hillside near the castle, but also where it overlooks Dajovy City. He took a guitar that he stole from Jomi's room, it's an all-in-one guitar; acoustic, clean and distorted. It is based on complex dendro-geo elemental magic powered by electro by its user. "Dream.." Mijo plays the chords to 'You Know You're Right (Demo Acoustic)' as he is mumbling most of the time to memorize the chord progression.

_Then.. one more time. He starts singing._

"This is in me in love again.." Mijo continues playing. "You'll never know.." Mijo looks at the castle. "Everything I've ever known.." Mijo looks to Dajovy. "Dream.." Mijo reflects on his life, the magical world and the light boring one beside it, it always seemed like a dream. A dream he hoped, he'd never awake from. "It's wrong in every point of view.." Mijo's emotions slightly make the guitar output distorted electrical sounds. "I couldn't breathe if I was you.."

"She will see another me.." Mijo's tears started forming. "When I'm through melting.." Mijo looks to the RoyalCo beside him. "It's another opiate.."

**_"But for me, it's everything.."_**

**"Dream.."**

Mijo continues the rest with just "Dream..." as he finishes the song. 

"Ugh."

Mijo drinks the RoyalCo, as everything around him felt more hot and zappy because of his elemental power slightly going out of control.

_"Rhida, I wish you were here."_

_Another 3 weeks pass. August 8._

"Say, what is.. life?" Mijo looked down on Rhida, on opposite sides of the perpetual war of the dark and light. "Life.. is how we live it, Mijo." Rhida responds as she looked at Mijo, her ice sword shining. "Then, why do we stand apart, love?" asked Mijo as he looks at the glint and reflection of the blade, seeing Rhida's determined yet conflicted look. "Distance." Rhida replied before going silent as the two circled on the barren lands of Nuevo León. "And.. ***separation.***" Rhida said, a bit shaky before steeling herself.

"Let's get this over with, love." said Mijo as his sword charged with electricity. "May we.. meet again in better nights." Mijo charged in as their swords clashed. Mijo immediately used his pyro and electro to force Rhida to constantly use cryo shards to prevent herself from being out manoeuvred. As Rhida was pushed, she can feel her boots skidding through the newly formed rime that is the result of her cryo exertion. Mijo moved back and launched slashes as Rhida formed ice walls to prevent damage.

"Saita!" shouted Mijo, before he launched quick whip-like lightning to test Rhida, as she countered with ice spears. "Niese!" Rhida launched ice spears to the barren ground to threaten to freeze Mijo's shoes. "Can't let you, Amphoreana." Mijo jumped as he launched, "FLOST!" forming a sword formed from hell to send down on Rhida as he deflected Rhida's ice shards directed towards him. Then before he landed, he broke Rhida's ice sword as he jumps on the impact, letting go of the hell sword. "Feel my wrath." Mijo unleashed his signature lightning to light-speed cuts as glass shards formed before he sheathed the blade, managing to narrowly dodge a blast of pure cold ice wind from a wounded Rhida.

"I'm sorry, Verante." Rhida floated up into the air as she unleashed, "BLIZZARD STORM!" the cold wind getting much more colder as snow and hail covered their area. "Haha.. then.. I shan't hold back either, my Amphoreana..." Mijo chuckled as he barely stood up, as he planted his sword onto the snow filled and now melted ground. "I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING." Mijo's body was almost covered in flames and lightning, as he held the hilt of his katana and sheathed it. Before the cold could fully kill him, he unsheathed it and completely moved through the area like a blazing meteor in lightning speed as Rhida's blizzard wasn't fading, it was getting mixed with Mijo's magic which was overwhelming poor Rhida so much she faltered as her ultimate broke as she fell to the ground.

Mijo, as he finally landed back on the ground, sheathed his sword again as the fire, lightning and snow slowly dissipated as he looked and slowly approached Rhida. He wasn't fine anyway, this fight hath caused more damage to his body more than he thought he could manage. But he persisted, like he always did as he detached his sheath from his pants and used it to hold himself up as he knelt on the pain-glazed, frostbitten and very weak Rhida. The two didn't even lock eyes as they tried to process how much pain and exertion they did for this moment to have happened.

**"..."**

"Rhida, I.. didn't expect to meet you this way." Mijo admits, before he finally laid down on the ground, looking up at the dark starry sky. "Yeah? Me too." replied Rhida, soft yet also weak. "Can I.. admit something or.. should.. we heal first?" asked Mijo as Rhida sighs and tries to stand up, limping. "We should.. go to.. Jomi's Castle, if you know the way." answered Rhida, as she looked around. "**They** have no use for me, now." Rhida comments before she sighs again. "Hah, you're too powerful, even for me." Rhida continued, as Mijo also carried himself up before helping Rhida. "I'll bring you to her castle, just.. talk." Mijo says before they started walking.

"You want me.. to explain how I got here — hah..?" Rhida struggled to say. "Got.. back because of.. someone.. opening the dark world.. heh.." Rhida was trying to breathe, but it felt so cold to breathe. "Leviente. Then we got roped in by Manecony.." Rhida then looked down, while weakly holding onto Mijo's shoulder. "You.. we.. they—" Rhida gasped as she accidentally felt her knees buckle as she almost tripped over something. "Leviente.. still with them.." Rhida grunted as they finally managed to go through the portal, the other Silver Guards understanding that their knight and his former paramour need quiet and space.

"Mijo! and— o—oh.. R—Rhida..?" greeted Jomi, as she saw the dishevelled state of the two. "She's one of the lightners the Manecony hired. Don't ask." Mijo as Jomi nodded. "G—got it.. I—I'll go and fix you up, right now." Jomi stepped back as she casts her cold yet stimulating energy to heal the two, slowly. "Wow.. she's.. still like herself.." Rhida snickered. "What? You think just because we were going through our own, she is too..?" Mijo retaliated as Rhida faintly smiled. "I'm just.. so unused to be back here.." Rhida looks around. "There. You're all fixed up!" Jomi excitedly says. "Y—you can go now.. a—and you can always find me near the portal or at my office.. o—okay?" The three nod before Jomi left.

_Jomi's Castle, Rhida/Mijo's room (the rooms were combined)_

"Ah.. I haven't been here in a while," Mijo looks around. "Seems, she has been uh.. doing some housekeeping." Mijo looks at Rhida, whom was laying on the bed. "Yeah..." Rhida was feeling sleepy, after fighting, and being defeated — she really wasn't itching to talk to Mijo, at least, she thinks, not in her current state. "Are you t—" Mijo clears his throat. "Right." Mijo lies on the floor, legs sprawled out. "Honestly," Mijo then lays down on the floor. "I'm surprised you showed up. I wasn't holding out for a miracle today."

"..." Rhida replied, "A miracle?" turning to face Mijo, as she was laying on her right side on the bed.

"Yeah," Mijo tilted his head left-to-right, "weren't you?" asked Mijo as Rhida was again, speechless, common in their serious talks. "I.." Rhida looks away, now laying on her back. She then puts her right hand on her forehead before saying sadly, "..no." Mijo sighed as he looked at Rhida, whom was staring intensely at the ceiling. "I should've known." Mijo commented before he could take it back. Rhida gasped, her hands moving to her mouth before turning to face the wall beside her bed. 

**Silence fills the room.**

Mijo sighs again as he stands up. He was looking at Rhida, like he wanted to say something but couldn't find the words to. He sighed before looking at his own bed. "School's soon." Mijo says. "Unless.. you want to talk anymore, I'm.. going." Mijo dusts off and adjusts his clothing (the clothes regenerate with healing). 

"Mijo." Rhida turns back to face him. "I.. didn't mean to.. answer that way..?" Rhida is trying to also stand up, but she's relatively more exhausted than Mijo — whom is so used to feeling tired he doesn't notice how his posture slumps or how he sways side-to-side, trying to keep himself stable. "What do you mean?" Mijo turns to face her, as he wasn't earlier. "I expected this, and.. you answered honestly." Mijo walks over and places a hand on her shoulder making her gasp, as she was sitting on the bed, instinctively tensing. "It's better than lying, if you.. feel this way."

Rhida looked at his face, up and imposing. "But.." Rhida trails off. "I.. want to care now.." Rhida bites back a sob. "I—I'm sorry—! Okay?" Another sob, "I just.. didn't want to think about it." Her hands fly to her face, "I had new friends.. new school.. I was happy, I guess..?" Rhida's voice was muffled. "Y—you were too, r—right?" Rhida put her hands down and looked at Mijo, who now wasn't looking at her. "Heh, as happy as I can be." Mijo smiles darkly. "Honestly, I'd forget too, if.." Mijo looks at Rhida. "..I had someone else to fuckin' obsess about." 

Rhida had her mouth open but no words came out. "Hah," Mijo pulled back. "You think you're the only one who was obsessed in.. love?" Mijo turned to face the right door, on Rhida's side. "I was, still am." Mijo sighed. "Well?" Rhida stood up. "Right.. let's.. go? Where?" asked Rhida, as Mijo smiled. "My school or your school?" asked Mijo, as he turned around to face her. "O—oh..? Is the portal in the school?" asked Rhida, taking tentative steps. "Yeah, school's out early, unlike before." Rhida nodded. "O—oh? R—really? I—I had to use this to escape my subject.. Uh.." Mijo answers, "I'm assuming whatever magic that allows people to not discover dark worlds willy-nilly or like— conveniently skips classes without.." Mijo rolls his eyes. "..class debt applies."

"I—I know that! I was just thinking of what I thought when I entered." responded Rhida, as she unconsciously twiddled with her dress. "Oh?" Mijo leaned a bit closer. "O—okay.. I might have forgotten.. but I do—don't now!" Rhida tries to drag Mijo with her but Mijo stays firm as she throws her head back in slight panicked confusion. Mijo stared at Rhida for a while, before chuckling and walking with her. "How did you deal with the dark world anyway, before me?" Mijo asked. "I—I'll tell you on the way, I guess." answered Rhida, as Mijo tilted his head to the left. "To..?" Rhida turned to Mijo, a bit exasperated. "To you— our school. The Honrato one, you know?? My portal's somewhere in Nuevo Leon, then I have to go through more barren lands." Rhida shakes her head. "I.. uh.."

"Rhida, let's worry when we're at the Castle World Portal." Mijo's hand twitched as he thought of touching Rhida's face before stopping himself. "*Now..* ***Talk.***"

"Um.. so.." Rhida *recounts.*

*"There was.. a dark world that appeared at our building's supply closet.."*

Mijo smirks. "Like in—?"

*"Haha.. shut up, I know, but it was like, very... obvious? Like, there's always someone else there that's not related to the dark world..?"*

Mijo tilts his head. "Well.. to be fair, the last one was in a used classroom.."

*"Umm... yes."*

Mijo looks at her directly. "So, it's not like different from before, why mention it?"

*"Uh.. because, when me and Leviente jumped in, we did it when class was ongoing, and no one was there to see us, which makes it so that no one follows us."*

Mijo nods. "Right, the.. 'protection of the dark'.. Continue."

*"Then we landed on this weird.. barren land.."*

Mijo is curious and hums, "Nuevo Leon?"

*"Not exactly...? But.."*

Rhida looks at Mijo, a bit uneasy and awkward, flashing an awkward smile. "Do you want me to go and.. tell the story of what we did there?"

Mijo pursed his lips. "Hmm... on the other hand, I do want to hear a story that doesn't involve me, but.." Mijo shakes his head. "I think this is for another time, after all.. we just met after five months of **separation.** Let's save it for.. if we ever meet again."

Rhida opened her mouth to speak but then huffed as she nodded. "I understand.."

*"So.. after.. I don't know how many hours, we came across this portal, and then we entered it, finding Manecony, based on the signs."*

Mijo is a bit surprised, "No wonder.. I didn't notice that—? I thought Jomi just named it herself, and.. ugh, I am so stupid— the people there also—" Mijo stops himself from further embarrassing himself.

Rhida let out a tiny chuckle before continuing, *"Then.. we met these people, like.. Saturday and Katala..? The guy, you know, the 'named after a date' guy, he 'recruited' us for like some 'cleansing' work."*

Mijo nods. "Huh, **cleansing?** Sounds vague enough to fall for, I understand—"

Rhida jolts up, looks at Mijo, slightly blushing and embarassed. "H—hey! Don't— baby me.. I—I was just exhausted, and thought the job was whatever and.. stuff.."

Mijo smirks. "Uh huh, and that led to you trying to kill me?"

Rhida's eyes widen. "N—no—! W—wait let me continue first—"

*"Uhh... so, Leviente was assigned to like 'internal security' or something, and I was assigned to hunt some target they were suspicious of."*

"Suspicion?" Mijo scoffs. "You really almost froze me because of suspicion??"

Rhida was shaking her head. "I—I was surprised okay?? Like— okay?? I messed up, and was so in shock, seeing you just casually kill abyss monsters, a—and all those conflicted— a—ah! Let's just go there!!"

*"I went.. with their plan. Went to a portal that led me to Nuevo Leon, walked around, froze and kill some abyss monsters, what I thought was what I was supposed to do then encounter a big abyss monster, then it's just.. you."*

Mijo was confused and scratched his head. "Wait, how did you find the target anyway?"

*"They gave me some detection magic on my.."* Rhida looks down at her broken ice sword, on her hip, floating. *"that. It.. pointed to your direction."*

"They got tracking?! Shit— that might be when I.." Mijo looks away in embarrassment. "N—nevermind. All you need to know is that they might have detected slight magic use..." Mijo covers his face. "..from the bathroom."

Rhida looks at Mijo, confused yet awkwardly fidgeting with her hands. "W—what does that mean..??"

Mijo shakes his head. "A—another time..! Hehe—! OKAY! CONTINUE."

Rhida nods. *"Well.. I—I guess I felt.. off. Y—you know, even though we're... talking, I didn't feel in that moment like we can confront our.. depths of our relations, without.. battling. A—and I wasn't exactly backing down, a—and I didn't even know it's you. For all I know, I could be like fighting someone that fights or looks like you!"*

Mijo nods understandingly, "I see." before stopping at the entrance to Honrato's light world. "Wanna.. reminisce?" Rhida looks away, then looks back, nodding, "Okay." while forcing an awkward smile. Then, they **went in.**

*TO THE LIGHT.*

"Welcome, to the fourth floor." Mijo says as he walks out with a casual baggy black pants and white shirt, and Rhida is wearing a polo shirt that has green bands over the collar, sleeves and a green scarf tied up. "Oh, you're..?" Mijo looks at Rhida's school uniform. "Yeah.. it's.. a.. christian school." Rhida looks around, "..very high prestigious.. daw." Mijo nods. "Alright..." Mijo looks at his watch, which he had in the light world but not in the dark world for some reason. "It's.. 16:30." Rhida processes that for a while before, "4:30 PM? Then.. my class is still ongoing."

"Your class..?" Mijo looks amused. "Y—yeah.. what..? Isn't yours..?" Rhida gasped, covering her mouth. "Funny thing, is.. yeah, we.. are on a new curriculum. The only one in Cab City!" Mijo boasts before asking, "Um, where do you study anyway? I don't remember you telling me." Rhida gasped again as she put her hands down. "Saint Lucile? The.. university in that.. mountain city, uh.. Fónti City."

"Oh wow.. I was wondering if you'd moved out of the city because, I'd think that a school that'd be as so-called 'more prestigious' than Honrato would be out.. didn't know you'd go straight to the college of your dreams straight after.. last year?" talked Mijo, before Rhida nodded. "Um.. yeah. I.. guess..?" Rhida wasn't exactly sure how to continue that.

The two looked at each other. Mijo looked at her conflicted, grateful she's here, scared of what has happened and will happen. Rhida on the other hand, felt a bit awkward and wanting to look away, though she's too scared Mijo might interpret it badly as she tries to smile awkwardly.

"Anyways. Let's go, and.. reminisce this moment." Mijo looks away as they walk to the balcony to see the school below them, not exactly empty but not crawling with people either. "You know, I never told you of what I realized after you left." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at him looking down, face unreadable. "W—what... is.. i—it..?" asked Rhida, her pulse quickening.

_"I.. don't think I am healthy in any.. ANY relationship."_

"..."

"I'll go on."

"Rhida, I.. I've always doubted myself. You know this, and basically everyone else, that isn't an enemy or a stranger. But, I've realized I tend to either disconnect entirely, like with Urda or Ikari.. or obsess over like you, Rhida."

Rhida instinctively shifts uncomfortably near him, before saying, "O—oh..? How.. um.. do you do so..?" Rhida was half-asking this, that Mijo might have been observing her without her knowledge or have like rituals or something, and half-signaling she's not exactly comfortable with whatever he's saying, but have to find out to trust him again.

"..."

"It's.. a lot, and.. I'd understand if you see me differently, but.. ugh, here I go."

"Firstly, when that first spark happened, during the first time we met, remember..? I had this weird feeling inside me, and.. I.. think it's love, but also.. obsession. Because, in my.. life, I guess..? I don't.. reciprocate love well, right? You remember how we went through that right? But, even after.. I still dealt with this need, **the need** to.. take care of you, protect you, and all what I thought was a way to redirect these emotions.."

"It just became worse and worse.. the more pressure was on.. especially during the second catacylsm.. Then after, the agonizing longing of someone that I know couldn't and wouldn't come back." 

Mijo looks the opposite angle of where he thinks Rhida is, he hasn't even looked at her direction, once. "Then, fate happened."

"..."

"Honestly, I wasn't exactly happy and had fully intended to kill  you, which would make you stuck in the light world, no form — no existing, you'll just be unconscious until someone closes the dark world. Somewhat wounded."

"I didn't think of that at the time."

"I'm sorry, am I revealing too much?"

Mijo looks at Rhida, looking down on the balcony, her face unreadable through her hair.

"..."

Rhida was there, and she didn't know how to take it all in. This meeting was going to take a toll, yet.. it all felt dizzying. She didn't know if she should hug him and just.. let the emotions simmer or leave to collect herself.

_"What if I said 'yes'?"_

Rhida thought to herself, before Mijo spoke up.

"Okay, I understand. The portal's behind you, you can leave anytime. I'll be at the classroom past the first one." Mijo deliberately said, before stopping, then almost silently sighing before leaving again.

After a while of silence, Rhida sighs.

"Where's Jomi when you need her to deal with a certain broken hero?"

_Jomi's Castle. 17:00. Dark World._

"I wonder where the two went.. likely to the light world, but I can't follow them.. right?" thought Jomi as she sipped coffee. "I'm worried of Mijo," Jomi spins around on her office chair. "...I don't know, he feels off, I guess.. I never thought about it." Jomi reflects, "He's a bit more.. playful, and.. a bit overwhelming sometimes, haha."

"Though, when he gets serious, this aura.. like, he's hiding a lot of built up something.. and.. well..?" Jomi thinks back to Rhida's condition. "I guess something was done, huh.." Jomi twirls a  pen on her hand. "Haha, I have my own problems but he's like.. so fudging important if he's in chaos or whatever, the world is too."

Jomi is stopped on her musing when Rhida arrives, tear-streaked and looking very conflicted when she looked at Jomi.

"H—holy me—! Rhida?" Jomi got out of her chair and immediately guided her to a seat in her office, a nice sofa where Mijo sits always. "What happened..?" asked Jomi, her voice going soft before sitting down beside her. "I—It's _him,_ isn't it?" 

Rhida simply held Jomi close, sobbing more as Jomi was pulled closer, her head on Rhida's shoulder. "Umm.. there.. there.." whispered Jomi as Rhida continued to cry.

Rhida starts mumbling through her crying but Jomi can only make out;

"Mijo.. he's just so.. why.. eh... but.. can't.. go.. ahh... Mijo—mmm.. love...???? What... whyy.. Jomi.. please... mmm.. nnn.."

"Rhida, um.. calm down, you're.. with me now, I promise." Jomi locks the office door and also made an ice wall just to make sure as she then looked back at Rhida, now pulling back slowly. Jomi doesn't get an answer, but she sees Rhida calming herself down while Jomi looks at her, concerned.

"Uh.. I don't have much context except that you returned and are a Manecony hire."

Rhida nods. "I—I mean.. I could tell you.. I—I just.." Rhida looked around rapidly around the office, especially to the windows. "..don't know how to." Jomi exhales a shaky breath as she gets her coffee and returns, while Rhida looked at her silently. "Coffee, um.. keeps me sane, haha.. Umm.. uh.." Rhida takes the coffee anyway. "So, Rhida.. uh.. how is.. wait— how are you doing right now?"

"Cool." Rhida faintly smirks as she sipped the coffee. "U—um, but the coffee's warm—o—oh..!" Jomi gets the joke. "Surprisingly, yeah.." Rhida looks at the coffee. "Where do you.. uh.. get this, anyway.. Jomi?" asked Rhida as Jomi nods and points to a seemingly random direction in her window. "I—I have an overground greenhouse there, a—and more underground, but this one is.. specially made for me because.. um.. coffee is.. hard to grow.."

Jomi awkwardly laughs, "I—It's so rich of me to do so.. since the population's.. um.. fighting for foodstuffs.." Jomi looks at Rhida's silent gaze at Dajovy. "It's.. fine, Jomi. You work hard, and so.. you _can_ indulge, haha." Rhida looks back at Jomi. "Besides, you're still working to find a solution, right? Like, the robot thingy..?" Jomi nods. "Y—yes! W—we might be able to use it months from now! B—but yeah, I.. um.. in the meantime.. I'm exploring the.." Jomi looks at Rhida's eyes closely before saying, "Nuevo León option too.."

Rhida felt Jomi's gaze and chuckled. "Oh yeah, where we went through, I saw guards and like plant development, you think it'll work?" Jomi smiles. "Maybe, if.. things go to plan, the Dark Pearl.. Um, that's just Urda, Lauvielle, Ikari and Mijo now.. They'll be able to travel to Nuevo Leon, expand it, rest then go ahead and hopefully defeat whoever wanted to kill Mijo using you.." Jomi looks around, looking like she spilled some accidental secrets. "A—ah, but that's just—umm.. a summary, uh.. I was about to actually ask Mijo—ah—um.. yeah— him, to hopefully deal with the issue now instead of never."

"Mijo's always dealing with **some** problem, huh..?" asked Rhida, as Jomi nodded slowly. "Yeah, since.. the first cataclysm, honestly." Jomi sighs. "As.. _THE_ Lightbringer, you know he's... busy." Rhida nodded. "I—I know, I.. just.. does he.. have any free time? Like, besides the one we do as a group, does he genuinely take **any** breaks?" Jomi shrugged. "I—I don't know.. Umm.. I don't actually know what he does once he enters the dark world." Rhida awkwardly chuckled. "Then.. that might be why.. He's skipping school, I guess.. but I just feel that he isn't using that time that is soo amazing to have fun, um.. we do like freak stuff right, ahaha.. remember the domain experiments..? Gosh.. how long that was compared to now..?"

"Oh, aha.. um.. yeah, they're now like... towns or something.. I can't remember where they used to be, still.. I get it, Rhida." Jomi pours her own coffee (Rhida **JUST** noticed she had a kettle beside the coffee on the table.) "We.. um.. how do you put this, you know of my past and supposed origin, and.. stuff, so.. when I say that I get why he's stressed, I get it.. But, it's just so hard to talk to him about it, I dunno." explained Jomi, as Rhida sipped her own coffee, before pouring more bare-handed (both had cryo so the steaming hot steel kettle didn't affect them..). "I.. ah.. we're— mmm.." Jomi immediately waved her hands all over the place. "I—It's fine— w—we can like.. uh.. I.. umm.." Jomi looks around but she was surprised when Rhida held her hand. "I—It's fine.. I'm.. fine, I just need some.. time to choose my words, uh.. you can start, Jomi."

"Um, Rhida, I have a question, will you be.. back here often?" asked Jomi as Rhida sighed, her breath in the increasingly colder room showing. "Uh.." Jomi leaned back as she nervously fidgeted with her dress collar. "Um, I.. don't know, actually I still don't know how to get back, maybe.. you can..? I—I don't know if you can though.. Since, uh.. let's.. ah—" Rhida chuckles, grabbing a pillow, putting it on her lap, and hiding her mouth using it. "If I can, I will. Uh, just.. I might be busy a lot of the time and.. yeah, as school usual stuff. And, ahaha.. I miss this world, really.. being so far away from.. Cab City, it's.. it's good to have a world to return to, y'know?" Jomi was silent, processing before nodding.

"Okay, I.. will figure that out, right after.. uh.. hmm.." Jomi was thinking of the logistics of the portal moving before shaking her head. "Right, so.. um.. right now, would you.. be comfortable with Mijo around you?" asked Jomi, as Rhida's reaction of a more quickened breathing and nervous fidgeting. "Ah.. uh.. w—well.. I—I guess.. not..? Ahaha.. Maybe I just need a break from— right, I haven't mentioned what.. he said to me," Rhida looks at Jomi, her lips quivering. "Is it bad..?" asked Jomi, as Rhida perused what to say before hesitantly nodding.

"W—well.. it's not.. bad-bad, like.. uh.." Rhida's hands move to rub her face, "UH.. he's.. uh.. *he calls himself obsessed with me.*" Jomi gasped and tilted her head. "How.. so..?" Rhida let out a hesitant sound as Jomi didn't say anything but was still drinking coffee and brushing her hair. "Uh.. it's.. complicated, he's like trying to say that everything about our relationship is just him reciprocating me, and to do that, he basically tries to say that it's only because of his obsession that he got that far.. Um.. I.." Rhida buries her face on her pillow. "AAAHHH Jomi how the fuck do you process that???"

Jomi is silent as she grabbed her own pillow. "H—honestly, I—I have no idea.. I've been.. struggling with his.. new.. 'charm' that.. he was doing..?" Rhida looked up, a bit curious yet concerned. "Uh, what??" Jomi awkwardly chuckled, before blushing slightly. "Ehe— I—I.. don't think I should.. uh.. well, in short, whenever we talk.. he like.. gets close and stuff, not too close, but enough that I notice it. And, he.. kisses me a lot too, f—for some reason..?" Rhida yelped, "HEH??? Mijo— he— isn't that like.. weird, technically..?" Jomi shrugged. "Ahaha.. I.. don't know, he only ever does it when we're alone.. so.. yeah."

*"Surely.. he wasn't.. like.. this, bad before.. right??"* Rhida asked, her voice shaking and scared.

"Um.. I.. y—yes." Jomi answers, looking down. "Something always changes within him every new.. dark world is opened." Jomi looks at Rhida, "I.. fear this is.. what Mijo's weakness is." Jomi reflects, "When he.. uh, made me, as in.. the notebook I am in the light world, I.. bear his problems, and.. that's probably why my backstory in the dark world is tragic. And.. about him, he.. is very stubborn, hah right? That's why he's the hero, brave and.. strong. But, due to his whatevers, could be school, the abyss, whatever problem that he encounters.."

*"It shapes him."*

"I.. don't know how to help him get through it, since I am only in the dark world and still very busy.. You.. well, uh.. I guess left.. and I guess since he was experiencing.. umm.. how.. do I say this, extreme loneliness? It's not that you don't have people to bond with, but rather you're.. detached. No one truly gets to you unless they directly start cracking that anti-social shell, bit by bit. And when he gets to that point? He, I guess, obsesses over that since it's very rare."

"Um.. How do I know this..?"

**"I.. just have a feeling."**

"..."

"So, he lives this.. uh..  very sad life, a—admittedly.. and.. if one is to make the mis— d—decision to interact and eventually.. get through to him, he'll.. crave that? Am I.. getting this uh.. correctly?" asked Rhida, unconsciously wetting her lips in nervousness.

"I.. believe so. You won't know until you directly ask him, but.. this.. is probably close, a—after all, he goes to me everyday, and.. occasionally.. talks seriously, between the kisses and.. somewhat deviant behaviour." said Jomi, as Rhida chuckled. "Hah, you two speak so closely, e—except you're more.. like me?" Rhida observed, as Jomi huffed. "H—hey maybe you're correct, since he.. clearly has a preference.." snarked Jomi while holding on her pillow tightly.

"Mijo.. uh.. he's.. I should go." Rhida said as she stands up, holding her hands up to her chest. "I'll make the portal, I think I know how to locate your.. uh.. location?? Just, um.. uh.. give me some of your magic." Jomi immediately responded, also standing. "Got it.. where shall we go then?" asked Rhida, as Jomi looked around. "I.. think I know a place, but let's clean up first." answered Jomi, as Rhida nodded.

_Mijo. 17:20. Light World. 4th Floor._

"She didn't return."

"I wish she did but.. I knew it, she's.. she can only take so much."

Mijo looks out, his heavy backpack beside him on the floor, looking out of the balcony again, as the students going out before the night falls are below, walking.

"I have to go home. But, **I. can't. leave. like. this.**"

"She hates me... ugh.."

"Keeping it inside was probably not going to do her favours."

"Still.."

**"I'm so *tired of dreaming.*"**

"I'm.. tired of all of these fights, relationships, heck— I can't even go here, or the Dark World without being met with some **stupid** issue. I can't get out, trapped.. ugh."

"Alone. And.. totally deserving of every single missed and broken opportunity."

"Another day."

Mijo looks to the door where the dark world is, silently gazing before sighing and leaving. "Fuck this, I don't.. I just.. I just need to.." Mijo stops himself, and heavily breathes before continuing, "She probably went to Jomi, ugh. I can't face any of them. Not now, never." Mijo, against every thought and instinct of his body went inside the dark world.

_Mizo quickly moves to Nuevo Leon._

"ARLEN!!!!" Mijo unsheathes 'Lightbringer', and splits through time and space to find him, casually growing more abyss clots and spawns. "Oh, the light—" Mijo heads on fights him, as Arlen reflects and parries Mijo's blade.

"Haha.. you're the light? How corrupted you are, you seem to even be more, than that princess." Arlen commented as he and Mijo locked blades. "Tch, if there's one thing I'm **always** good at?" Mijo moved back, sheathing his blade then floating as he summoned 'Mirage Lance of Сохранение'. "**ELIMINATING ENEMIES LIKE YOU.**" 

***"THE BURNING SUN — RAIN UPON YE!"***

Arlen chuckled as he used the abyss monsters to swarm Mijo to distract him to teleport out of there. "Go ahead, use *every single* power of yours to destroy Nuevo Leon, hm?" taunted Arlen, making a portal. 

***"ABSOLUTE POWER."***

Mijo threw the mirage lance before unsheathing 'Lightbringer' to cut a way through the swarm then summoning his 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' katana for the final and last attack. *"SURPASS, BEYOND THE ABYSS."* Mijo's signature moving through space and time to get a cut on Arlen's left shoulder before he managed to escape as Mijo immediately moved to get his lance then sword to finish off the rest of the abyss monster stragglers.

*Mijo is at a breaking point. The surroundings are barren, whatever ruins was there had crumbled.*

"Can't.. die here, haha.." Mijo unsummoned his blades, before forcing himself to run back.

_Jomi's Castle, 'Garden of Portals' 17:45_

"Thanks, Jomi.. I.. I'll be back, I just need to—" said Rhida before she and Jomi got interrupted by Sasha.

"Princess, Mijo. He.. uh.. he managed to.. find Arlen, somewhat graze him, then he just left. We felt a huge energy burst coming from wherever he was.. He says that he's 'taken care of some abyss corruption'.. He is truthful, yet we can't go in there yet, the signs of intense magical use make us unable to start healing it until a week from now." said Sasha to Jomi, overheard by Rhida.

"W—what??! Where is he?!" Rhida asks before Jomi could say anything.

"Ma'am Rhida, he said he was going back to the light world—"

Rhida rushes, she knows exactly where Mijo went.

_Light World. 4th floor balcony. 17:50_

"Mijo— w—what did you.. do..." Rhida trails off as she sees Mijo looking at her directly in the eyes. "Grazed an abyss boss. I know exactly how to defeat him.. But.." Mijo turns to leave. "That is for another day. I know you can go home, Rhida. Go. It's getting late, and.." Mijo sighs. "Just stay safe, **we both know we don't want to see each right now.**" Mijo fully leaves.

"Mijo.. I.. damn. He.. he's definitely.. ugh. He's right. I have to go." Rhida leaves.

## Author's Note:

So, let's end it off there, I.. did not expect this chapter to go this way, and I am not that happy with how I characterized Mijo, as in.. well, IDK, it just feels that he's *too tragic??* Like, it feels like 'fixing' this mess of a character in like character development, it's like he's not a perfect hero, but *HE IS ONE.* I want characters to recognize both the light he shines, as well as the mortal human self that is flawed.

I am not sure if this is a good way to move this, especially since I personally feel that the 'obsession' I intentionally made Mijo somewhat hyperbolic in how he says it due to his current mental state, I feel that I haven't showed enough 'good' Mijo moments to assume he can do better, though to be fair, this is only a chapter that focuses on his problems with Rhida, not that they never had good memories.

I intended to add a Dark Pearl Section, but.. I think it's better as a separate chapter, maybe focusing on another POV after three straight Mijo ones that delve deeper into his psyche. Also because of how I wrote these parts.

---

### Oh, and sidenote, after much reflection, my answer to 'Mijo is profoundly human';

I agree, in that by the focus of Mijo here, we simply set up that he shouldn't and couldn't hold the world by himself, and that his flaws shown in his interactions with Jomi and Rhida show how he isn't perfect, but not exactly ireedemable.. It's a very complicated process, and.. It's just.. when Jomi said 'it keeps happening whenever a dark world opens' she is indirectly saying that my writing revolves around Mijo and how he constantly changes and finds himself in new ground; firstly, establishes the lightbringer, then next arc, reinforces it while cracks show, then current arc, the decay.

I think I feel a bit overwhelmed because it's something that requires delicate healing that I usually don't do (like, usually the heroes aren't visibly flawed in a way that feels viscerally real, i.e. Jomi's arc of from scared puppet vessel to her own princess of right feels more fantastical than ciinically depressed heavily pressured Mijo, which since he is basically us (IRL) but havign a magical world to enter, his problems are more emotionally consuming for me to write, even Rhida too! It's just that since Mijo is the Main character, he's the one most explored. I want to do other chars, but often, Mijo's character development drives the plot so yeah.

---

Anyway, I think that's about it, I'll keep going, and see where the story goes. I won't change much drastically, as this was a product of it's time, and if I'm not happy with it now, I might see it differently months from now, after going through more things and writing more.

See ya, my readers! Good day, peace and have a safe day ahead~!

_July 25, 16:00, Light World. 3rd Floor, School Building._

"I think it's time.." said Urda to herself as she looks out of the balcony. "Time to..?" asked JR, as they looked over the school. "..to enter the dark world?" answered Urda, while turning to JR, a bit confused.

"What...?? There's a new one?" responded JR as Urda scratched her head. "Oh— I.. yeah. There's a new one, Mijo DM'ed me about it." responded Urda, as JR rolled his eyes and sighed. "It's like.. five weeks into the new grading, I was wondering why there weren't dark worlds.. and this is how he informs us?"

"I.. don't like how he did it, but.. he.. seems to be dealing with a big issue." explained Urda, as her face turned concerned. "I dunno, I feel like he never really liked how the second cataclysm went." reflected Urda, as she turned to JR. "Fair, he's like.. the **Lightbringer** or whatever Jomi told us, whatever it is, he's important, clearly." responded JR, as Urda turned to the hallway to the left of them. "I haven't seen him enter the dark world since the section reshuffled, and.. it  has been a while since we even spoke or chatted." Urda shrugs. "Heh, life.. huh?"

_"Mhm, while we deal with stupid PTs, he deals with abyss monsters daily.. What a contrast."_

"Anyways, JR, you think we can start next week? I'll have to ask the others still at school, maybe you too.. Mijo, looks busy. And, I dunno, he's the leader, but like— we kinda have to move on our own.. y'know?"

"I'll.. ask around."

"Cool, see ya~"

The two disperse.

_A Group Video Call, for some reason. July 26, 19:00. JR's the host._

_JR accepts Urda into the call._

"I don't know why we did this instead of chatting in the GC, Mijo's not even online right now..?" said Urda, her mic's dubious quality showing.

"Courtesy of the self-titled 'Shock Laywer'.." snarked JR before he noticed two people trying to join.

_JR accepts Lauvielle and Ikari into the call._

"Hey hey I'm kinda busy rushing the PT for my group next week, can we make this quick?" said Lauvielle in a slightly joking tone.

"Lauvielle..!! We're literally just done doing it— don't believe the mfer, she's a lying sack of shi—" responded Ikari in an exaggerated loud voice before JR muted her saying.. whatever she was about to curse about.

"Settle down, this should've been a group chat text.. ugh, anyway! Chop chop!" said JR as he unmuted Ikari. "Hey! I was saying very important things, JR!" Ikari clears her throat. "Ahem, anyways.. yeah let's do this!! So guys, have you gone into the new dark world thingy?"

"Wait! Ikari, Urda! Where is even this dark world entrance anyway??" asked Lauvielle before Ikari slightly smirked. "The BATHROOM on the fourth floor of our buildings, remember?? I told you when Urda spoke to us." Lauvielle nodded, "Ohhhhh......!!! That's why he goes to the bathroom often?"

"NO?! Wait— well?? Maybe?? Actually, the one I'm talking about is the locked one beside the females-only one." said Ikari, as Urda chimed in. "I checked where he went before the sections shifted, seems you're right, I think the right bathroom is for some reason always locked in the higher floors.." JR further added, "Hah, and he got higher? He's definitely using the right door."

"But how? Don't you like have to have a key or something to enter then make the dark world?" asked Lauvielle as JR pondered, "Maybe like before, someone opened it, but not Mijo." The rest mumble and nod in agreement. "Wait— I'm confused, is he on the 3rd or 4th floor?" asked Lauvielle as the others mumbled that no one knew. "Someone should approach him," said Lauvielle, as Ikari immediately smiled. "You do it, you do it!"

"Huh? Why me?! You're the one speaking to him— sometimes??" complained Lauvielle as JR chimed in, "Can't be me. Haven't spoken to the guy in a while." Urda added, "I—I um... don't have—not sure, what we are.. so.. it's between you in his section!" Ikari managed to respond, "But you— okay, fine! I think I can get some ice to break with him, is it digital or—" Lauvielle cut her off, "JUST SPEAK TO HIM DAMMIT—" in an irritated yet funny way.

"Anyways, people of the Philippines.." said JR as he stretched his neck left to right. "We'll all go in at.. Tuesday, Ikari, go and tell Mijo to quit being radio silent on the GC so we can do stuff in the dark world, okay?" instructed JR, as Ikari nodded, "Got it!"

_Silence.._

"I—I'm going if the—" said Urda before she suddenly got cut off by JR ending the meeting, kicking all of them. "Oh.. Well, um.. guess I'm going to go and g—"

_Next day, Jomi POV, Jomi's bedroom._

Jomi was sleeping peacefully on her pink and purple royal king size bed until she woke up and immediately jumped as she saw Mijo casually chilling on her gamer chair.

"Oh hey, Jomi." said Mijo, as he stood up. "W—what are you doing in my—" blurted Jomi before Mijo sat on her bed. "Was waiting." said Mijo as Jomi was speechless in confusion. "Waiting..? For what—? What??" questioned Jomi, as she looked around her bedroom. "You." said Mijo, obviously looking smug. "W—wait for me outside dammit! O—or—" Jomi grabs a pillow and throws it at Mijo, hitting him without much resistance. "I'm here to discuss stuff, or.. chat really—"

_"You.. You're not serious?"_

"Uh.." Mijo stands up. "Yeah." Mijo shrugs. "Anyways, are you going to—" Mijo is cut off by Jomi blurting out, "GET OUT!! I—I AM.. Ummm.... I'm going to change clothes, get out!" Mijo nods and shrugs before leaving the room. "What's up with him today..? Well, to be fair, this is just an escalation of his.. previous behavior, anyway." mumbled Jomi, as she got out of bed and dressed up.

_Later.. 14:00. @ A Dajovy Alley, both disguised._

"Haha, now that we're easy.." Mijo smiled. "What's.. with Arlen, hm?" asked Mijo, as Jomi froze up. "A—Arlen...?" Jomi looked at Mizo, surprised. "H—how.. how.. do you—?" Mijo pushed Jomi to the alley wall, "So you do know him, great! I thought my.. talk with Cara was for nothing.." said Mijo, as Jomi gasped, and tried to break out of his hold. "W—what do you mean..? When..? How..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo put a finger on her mouth to shut her up.

"Yesterday.. You don't need to know about that, princess.." said Mijo as he summons his sword (katana). "After all, you're so busy with the robot and government, you'll fail to ask me what I did yesterday, and so I got away with going to Nuevo Leon to hunt down that 'boss' Cara mentioned, only to find her too! How, _fun."_ 

Mijo puts the sheath on Jomi's neck. "H—hey, I—I was about to tell you—I just—" blurted out Jomi before Mijo kissed her on the lips, while holding her down.

"Mmnnn? Mijo?? What are you—mmn! Ah—! You're really—" Jomi feels Mijo's way too close, but his hands are on hers, just.. preventing her from moving her hands. Mijo pulls back. "Is that all you're hiding? Come on, don't tell me Cara and you are working now..? She looked hesitantly confidently talking to me, like she has to.. She never spoke to me more than taunts, unless..?" Jomi shook her head, she knows the consequences of revealing more to Mijo.

"I—I swear, it's.. we.. she's just there because of the boss, okay? Like— me and her?? Are you suggesting I got back with my—" Mijo interrupted, "Mhm, you did speak to her, and consciously don't hunt her down, by your own admission, last christmas.." Mijo held her hands tighter, making her gasp and uncomfortably use her cryo to freeze Mijo's hands which simply made Mijo use his pyro to burn her ice and then her hands, only slightly though.

"Stop—stop—I—I'm not lying—!" Jomi curls her hands, accidentally holding Mijo's tighter. "I—I swear, please.. trust me, I.. I'm not cooperating with Cara or Rasca.. Okay?" Jomi was shaking, she was, but she knew Mijo did not like them, for good reasons, but she had her own reasons for keeping her conversations private. "Are you sure, or are you half-saying the truth, so that I almost know what's happening, my.." Mijo kisses Jomi again on the lips, making Jomi squeak before continuing, "_dear princess?"_

"N—no! No.. please.. pull back.." said Jomi, her pulse so quick she can feel herself dizzy from just trying to handle Mijo. "I—I am sure." Jomi looks at Mijo's eyes, amused yet suspicious before he pulls back. "Hah, then we shall continue, hm?" said Mijo as he grabbed her right hand and dragged her outside the alley. "Y—yeah..! Yeah.. haha.."

_Rasca, eating ice cream while looking at the two, disguised._

"Ma'am, do you know why he's so.. toxic?" asked Rasca to Cara, as Cara shrugged. "I.. don't know, doc." Cara drinks RoyalCo orange flavored juice. "I only gave him the bare minimum, on who's the guy he's supposed to be hunting, and nothing else, like.." Cara smirked, "Not like I became Jomi in trying to talk to him properly." Rasca sighs, "You do know that he's been this unstable since he arrived back after last christmas? Anything you do will connect if he's particularly.. obsessive."

"Shush, I know what you mean." Cara drinks more juice, then tries to take Rasca's ice cream. "Queen, do not. This is mine, you've already finished yours." said Rasca, as Cara pouted. "But doc.. How will I defeat the usurper scum without my precious energy?" asked Cara, as Rasca sighed and gave it to Cara. "The consequences of having a former royal as your abyssal partner.." mumbled Rasca as Cara smiled and continued eating.

"But yes, Mijo's particularly obsessed with finishing Nuevo Leon's reclamation, from what I can tell.." commented Cara, as she ate way too much in one go and her mouth shut and she was unable to move it until Rasca noticed and used slight abyss magic to make it open again. "Thanks.. doc.." Cara sighs, "When is V2 of this body getting completed?? I'm tired of these small errors.." Rasca shrugged, "When we can use abyss magic uninhibited. Which, while living in Jomi's domain.. we cannot, for now.."

"Can't we just ask the poor princess?" asked Cara, as she finished the ice cream. "We just saw her be.. weirdly uncomfortable in front of an interrogating Mijo. Unless you want to anger the lightbringer you need to defeat Arlen.." Rasca looks at Cara's eyes. "You should reconsider asking for more than what Jomi has been giving, we've been able to exist here, and that's.. enough for now. Until Arlen's defeated." explained Rasca, as Cara groaned but nodded. "Yes yes you're right, I was just.. expressing what I want to happen, not that it'd happen."

"..."

"If Arlen's defeated, queen.. are you going to continue his plan?" asked Rasca as Cara shrugged. "We'll get there when we get there. We.. know what his plan is, I just.. have some second thoughts about our original 'rule the dark world' plan ever since that Nuevo Leon disaster.." Rasca stood up, helping up Cara. "Oh? Character development, my queen?" Rasca smirked. "Hah, doc, shut up.. You were the one initially hesitant when you put me into this body." Then, they walk away.

_Monday, July 28. 14:55_

"Heyyy.. Mijo." greeted Ikari, as Mijo looked up from his phone, neutral. "Hm? What?" asked Mijo as Ikari scratched her head. "So.. dark world, remember?" asked Ikari, as Mijo looked at her for a while then looked away and nodded. "Mhm, yes.. that. The dark world's on the right door of this floor." said Mijo, going back to his phone. "Oh? Okay.." Ikari nods.

"So.." said Ikari as she looked around. "You asked me about the dark world, right.. and.. I.. uh.. didn't go.. because.. I was.. busy.. and.. stuff stuff.." Ikari is awkwardly shifting as she regretted whatever words that just came out of her mouth. Mijo is silent but sighs and responds, "It's fine.. I'm.. over it. Just, whatever.. You have.. anything else?" asked Mijo, as Ikari looked at Mijo a bit confused yet suspicious.

"Uh.. oh, umm... yeah, can you send some message about like new developments? We may need some updates, like.. because we haven't been there and.. yeah, that's it, I'm going." said Ikari, turning away, not before waiting for Mijo to answer. "Sure." Mijo shrugs. "Who's going?" Ikari remembered. "Oh! Me, Lauv, JR and Urda!" answered Urda as Mijo commented. "Tch, I should make a new one." Mijo reflects, "A lot of the members can't be physically here in Honrato."

"New GC..? Sure, just message us later, okay, bye!" replied Ikari, before leaving fully. "Ugh.." Mijo scoffs.

_The Dark Pearl (V2) GC_

Mijo: 

@everyone, due to the new dark world discovered around the beginning of this school year, I shall make a new GC to accompany the fact:

1. About half of you (5/10) are out of Honrato or haven't been active since the first cataclysm.
2. I am making a new one to preserve this one in history or if there's a reunion. To not worry anyone that has moved on, I have to make a new one.
3. Now unless you are suddenly motivated to leave and leave this chat in the archives tab, I hope you do remain here for any future correspondence, for now.. I bid you adieu.

_To the starward future, and the dark pearl on the high seas._

— Mijo, The Lightbringer and Leader of the Dark Pearl

_The Dark Pearl (V3) GC_

(Mijo created the GC, sets himself as the admin.)

(Mijo added JR, Urda, Ikari and Lauvielle.)

(Mijo sets everyone as the admin.)

Mijo:

Hello. I shall inform you of the latest developments:

1. Manecony. New Dark World, once you go through the door, make sure to go through the portal in front of you for Kultima (and Dajovy) and the bathroom stall door for Manecony, as that's where you will land.
2. Nuevo Leon Land Reclamation. Due to.. the situation that you know happened in Nuevo Leon, it is completely desolate and now crawling with abyss corruption. I, and princess Jomi are currently focused on reclamation and destruction of abyss threats.

_May you enjoy your time, to the starward journey, and the dark pearl on the high seas._

— Mijo, The Lightbringer and Leader of the Dark Pearl

_Tuesday.. 15:30._

"Hey hey YOU get back here!" said Ikari, as Lauvielle was dragged by the hair. "Hey!! I wasn't going to leave—" Ikari interrupts, "If you leave you always get dragged into small side quests, now unless you're really wanting to wander off for hours, stay." Lauvielle grumbled. "Ugh, fine fine.. I was like.. totally not going to sing my heart out at ALL.." The two are interrupted by Urda and JR, going up to the fourth floor.

"Hey.." Urda greets them. "Hello." JR greets them too, as they group up. "So.. does anyone have any questions before going in?" asked Lauvielle, as everyone shook their heads. "Then let's go go—!" exclaimed Lauvielle, as they walk and go to the door. JR turned the doorknob and, as expected, a dark abyss met them. The four quietly nodded to each other before they jumped in one by one; JR, Urda, Ikari and Lauvielle. 

_To the dark world... in Manecony, the bathroom stall._

*\*They fall onto each other...*

"Hey get the hell off me—" Lauvielle scrambled Ikari off. "I—I—hey! Why is this so cramped—" Ikari accidentally walks into Jomi's Castle World. "Hey— um, Ikari? Aren't we going through Manecony?" asked Lauvielle as the others chuckled. "Shut up! That 'portal' is incredibly small, like two people can barely fit there—" JR speaks up, "Shush. We should go to Jomi first, if she is even her office..."

"She probably is.. wouldn't she usually greet us?" asked Urda, before immediately clarifying, "I—I mean not that she always does— but like— she.. like I don't know, should know we're here at least?" The group goes silent before JR shrugged, "Let's just go to the office."

_Jomi's office..._

"Ugh.." Jomi grumbled as she looked through reports, it seems that the piling-up of reports hasn't stopped. "The 'Boss' intensifying attacks on the zone.. Abyss magic use spreading nearer to the castle, robot progress... ugh.." Jomi flips through more papers. "Scians-Chemistra — Shley calls a peace committee next week to discuss the current crisis, invites Princess Jomi and her own delegation for mediation.." Jomi sighs, and writes on her notebook. "A meeting.. on.. August 15.." Jomi slumps on her chair, as she drops her pen on her notebook and looks up to the ceiling. "Okay, everything's fine.. we just.. need Mijo, and.. the Dark Pearl?" Jomi narrows her eyes slightly, "Right, where are they?"

_A door is gently opened._

"Hm? Who's there?" Jomi looks back down to see the group entering. "JOMI!!!" Ikari and Lauvielle rush to hug Jomi, which makes Jomi awkwardly laugh and red slightly as JR and Urda wave their hands to greet her. "It's been soo long, like.. four months!" said Lauvielle as Ikari added, "Mhm, the party was fun, but— now that we're back.." Both pull back. "What's the goal, Jomi?" asked Ikari, as Jomi stood up and the group followed her to the couches behind them. "Sit, sit.. um.. the rest of Mijo's friends?" said Jomi, as she sits on her special fluffy armchair. "Haha, added it.. um.. just this day, now.."

*"I shall tell you of.. uh.. ahem. The New World on the Horizon..."*

"On the horizon?" asked Lauvielle as Ikari almost smacked her. "It's a metaphor! Not literally, we're in a winter world dumbass how would we—" Lauvielle interrupted, "I—I know! But like, is it?" JR nudged Urda as she spoke up, "Guys.. maybe we can just listen.." The two playfully glare at each other before nodding.

*"A land of festivities, of grand wealth and elation. It sprawls with malls, shops, and everyone dream chasing to the stars they see above!"*

*"It is the land of Manecony."*

"A—anyway, aside from it, the.. desolate Nuevo Leon is also available.. and probably more important.. considering the boss there and all.." Before Jomi could continue, she stopped due to the gasps by the others. "T—the boss..!! It's.. um... he's like.. a big bad, an abyssal boss, who looks like a dark knight figure roaming and controlling the chaotic abyss magic there to attack the entirety of the dark world as a whole to rule it for himself." Jomi hesitates before adding, "U—um.. we're not sure if that is his plan.. it's.. inferred, of course, we haven't gotten to talk to him about his motivations, haha.."

"Oh, so there's this bad guy, again.. just like uh.. Rasca, or.. that Queen in that Computer World!" commented Lauvielle, twirling her hair. "An abyssal boss? Jomi, how strong is he, exactly?" asked JR, as Jomi thought on how to say it. "I.. wouldn't mention him if he wasn't as strong as Cara, or Rasca.." Jomi know she can't mention that this isn't exactly true now, but she needed to give them a way to compare it. "Wow.." mumbled Urda, before clearing her throat. "Um, so, Mijo has been here since like.. longer right? I—I'm curious why hasn't he won over the boss?" The others look at her, thinking about the question before Jomi answered, "Uh.. well.. he hasn't exactly found a way to fight him for long, I think.. Like, the boss probes him but always leaves before he could fully.. 'unleash'.. Oh, and he's getting bogged down by other.. abyss monsters."

"Ah, so he needs help, then? Don't worry, we.. uh.. remains of the Dark Pearl are here! The crew might have been halved but we're still sailing!" said Urda, as she looked around with others awkwardly cheering before she leaned back and looked down, while putting her hands on her chest. "Okay, stop bullying the poor girl.." spoke up JR, "I see that the hero needs some help, and hasn't been asking.. ugh." JR shakes his head. "Reckless, and self-destructive guy he is.." Everybody else nods awkwardly. "O—oh, I—I think you four should focus at.. um.. oh, hehe.." Jomi awkwardly shifts on her seat. "The.. abyss usage in Dajovy.. it's.. bad a—and!! It's not my— uh.. it's.. just.." Jomi awkwardly looks around, but not at the lightners. "I—I.. need your help, please?"

"Come on, princess~" responded Lauvielle, grinning. "**YOU** know we have your back, why so fidgety about it?" Ikari stands up. "Just like... tell us what to do, we'll do it, and have fun on the way, typical adventure type.. seriously, girl." Jomi put her hands up to stop the others from speaking, palms facing them. "O—okay, you don't need to encourage me! I just.. nothing! Okay, but let's see.." Jomi stands up, and rushes to her notebook while the others watch her. "Okay, so.. you have to.." Jomi trails off when she notices that some of the reports are by 'Tima' and 'Raca'. "Uhuh.. why aren't they.." mumbled Jomi, before shaking her head. "Ah! Um.. so in Novaya Stogograd.. There's.. suspicious abyss magic use, reported.. Um.. I just kinda want you to like.. walk around there, uh.. basically, help my guards hunt these illegal uses of abyss magic."

"Hm, why *are* they getting away though, Jomi?" asked JR, as Jomi looked at him, slightly tensed but trying to compose herself. "It's.. just.. some.. desperation.." Jomi sighs, as she closes her notebook and sat down. "Look, I think you can get the picture, but people are getting desperate and.. just.. self-policing isn't enough now, as I also.. try to use.. abyss magic to solve the king— country's.. problems.." Jomi's face visibly goes darker and sadder. "It looks and sounds hypocritical, dangerous, but it's the only hope we darkners have in solving any of our societal problems." Jomi looks at them. "I.. um.. don't know how you can help, anyway.. Just, do what I said.. and maybe you'll find something I can't as the 'leader' of this slowly freezing over land.."

The group silently nodded in acknowledgement. "Hah, it's.. been a long time." commented JR, as he sighs and looks up. Lauvielle goes and hugs Jomi, while Ikari thinks about the words, a bit irritated but planning. Urda meanwhile is looking around, trying to regulate her breathing. "There, there.. we promise, we'll.. win. No matter what, the Dark Pearl, never stands down!" reassured Lauvielle as Ikari pointed out, "Hey, you're the only one that promised, I dunno if we actually can fulfil it.." Lauvielle chuckled but retorted, "Shut up.. let her have this.. she.. looks stressed, we take what we can give.."

*Silence permeates the office, for a while..*

_Next week, August 4, Monday. Remote Snowy Area, Near Dajovy._

"Ugh, doc.. do I have to..?" asked Cara to Rasca, as she nods. "Mhm, queen.. if you do not have the capacity to spy on Arlen, how would we be useful to Jomi, or more harrowingly, Mijo and his lightners?" answered Rasca, as Cara grumbled but stretched her synthetic arms. "Alright, alright.. I know how to do it okay? I.. I uh.. just.." Cara shakes her head. "Nevermind, what about the.. lightners, I mean.. the other ones." asked Cara to Rasca, as she thinks. "I could help them, I don't exactly like random Dajovsky residents using **your** power, but.. I am also taking precautions about your safety, my majesty." replied Rasca as Cara nodded. "Yeah yeah, look.. I got this, just go and do whatever with the lightners, I'm sure dear princess will appreciate it, very very much." Cara turns to the portal behind her. "Well, I should take my leave. Same retreat to the house?" Rasca nods to Cara's question before Cara smiled and left.

*Nuevo Leon, Random Ruins.. 08:00*

"Dark Knight?" called out a male voice, as Cara appeared and immediately hid in an invisible magic cloak. "Hm? So, you have heard of my offer, Saturday?" asked Arlen, as Saturday chuckled. "Well, I suppose so, but.. do not take this lightly, I do not come to this.. barren land for nothing." Saturday sighs, "You speak of paradise, where is it?" asked Saturday, as Arlen laughed. "So.. direct, my my.." Arlen summons something Cara can't see, but feel it's immense abyssal power. "This.. is.. intense, could this be..?" asked Saturday, before Arlen gave Saturday something, some black orb Cara can't make out through her hiding spot below some rocks. "It gives you, power. Power to change your world." Arlen smiled. "Haha, and what is the price, exactly?" asked Saturday as he absorbed that power. "You don't just.. give away this piece of your.. immense abyss power, for nothing.. for me to reshape Manecony.."

Saturday glares at Arlen. "I will not do everything you want me to, but.. if you request something I can do, I shall.. it.. is good business practice." Arlen nods. "I understand your pride, Saturday. I do not need much, you just need to.." Arlen summons his sword. "Track down each lightner you will find, and make sure to turn them against each other.." Arlen shows off his sword by twirling it around. "If you find this.." Arlen gives Mijo's essence stolen during one of their many many encounters. "..lightbringer, make sure.. to eliminate him, as much as possible. Make him go here, this barren land you call." Arlen grins. "Then, I shall take care of him." Saturday nods, then leaves through an unknown portal.

"Huh, someone's being.. a little ambitious.." Cara thinks, before she tries to leave and gets surprised when Arlen tried to attack her. "Agh—!" Cara dodged but some of her royal dress was slashed. "Tch, you knew I was there the entire time?" questioned Cara as she parried then ran from Arlen's blade. "No, I simply felt your presence once.. *he* was gone." Arlen tries to attack Cara's sword repeatedly but she held her ground. "What was it, hm? I promise I won't do that again, just so we don't fight~" asked Cara manages to push Arlen to a wall as Arlen responded with abyss tentacles grow from the ground to distract Cara while he goes for the kill. "I seek your power, it is only courtesy I know of your scent, *dear.*" Arlen manages to get a cut on Cara's chest before Cara manages to cut him too, on his left, magic using arm.

"Don't call me *anything* like that." Cara starts dissipating to teleport back to her home. "We are long past that, usurper." reiterated Cara before Arlen laughs, as he looks at his left arm then uses it to further take more abyss magic from Cara, forcing her to try managing her chaotic abyss magic while trying to escape. "You can try, queen. Know that once you pick your battles a little too much, I **will win,** and.. heh, maybe get you back again." Arlen looks amused as Cara fully dissipates and arrives at her home, badly damaged, her system running overclocked again.

"Damn it.. stupid.. kn—knight.." Cara spits out, as she clutches her chest. "I.. disgrace, did not.. Arlen—!" Cara collapses on the floor, as she tries to crawl upstairs to Rasca's room for her to-go 'emergency repair tools'.

_Rasca, meeting with the Dark Pearl (without Mijo) @ 7:55_

"Hey, uh.. Miss... Tima, yeah?" asked Lauvielle, as Rasca looked up from her tablet and nodded. "Yeah, that's me." Rasca looked around. "What do you want from me.." Rasca eyes them down. "...lightners?" asked Rasca, as Lauvielle looked at JR to answer. JR rolled his eyes but answered, "We're looking for abyss users, because you know, the princess said so. We wanna find out where you find them, and why her guards are unable to take care of it."

"Oh?" said Rasca, as she faintly smiled before answering, "Well, if she hadn't mentioned it.. _Desperation._" Rasca turns her back and walks as the group cautiously follows. "People have been looking for a way out of this eternal winter. Some say, abyss power contains some way to catalyze enough pyro to melt entire cities." recounted Rasca as they arrived at a small collection of buildings at some far-end part of the city, near some cliffs.

"They'd usually sneak out. Jomi's guards never check people's houses, for good reasons, mind you." Rasca further adds, "Privacy. But, as the _hopes and dreams_ slowly fade in this eternal winter.. Some people want to take this matter into their own hands." Rasca turns to them. "Nuevo Leon Expedition. I think you all know about that, right?" asked Rasca as the group nods in various understandings. "The problem with that, is it's very dangerous beyond the livable settlements and the rumored big abyss boss terrorizing Sasha's army."

"So, they turn to this. Without any portals to Scians-Chemistra, rumored to be because of some dumb politics..." Rasca shrugged. "People, with the will and courage to do so, go and hunt various seemingly unexplored ways. It just so happens, abyss magic is one of those ways." As Rasca was looking at the collection of buildings, JR spoke up. "How do you know so much, Tima?" JR looked around him, in the snowing morning. "Thought like, you were just some random doctor on her off-time."

Rasca chuckled before answering, "I just happen to listen and walk with more awareness than others.. Also, the hospitals.." Rasca shudders, a first for her, the group thought. "The countless.. the corruption.. ugh.." Rasca shakes her head then checks her tablet, her eyes narrowing. "Let's go." Rasca and the group continue to the target location.

_The collection of buildings, 8:25_

"H—hey! Who are you.." A random guy holding a pyro rifle says as he sees the group and Rasca. "Miss Tima. Remember me?" asked Rasca, as the guy widened his eyes as he looked at the lightners then her. "Did the princess send them?! Why did you.." said the guy before JR spoke up, "Hey, we're not exactly here to stop you. But, we do have to warn you in how dangerous it is, and the reason that it's regulated heavily." JR is remembering that little book Jomi gave him about Kultima's magic up-to-date book of laws that he wanted to read for fun.

"Yeah, so?!" said the guy as he looked around them. "WE ARE STARVING MAN!" said the guy as he held his gun tighter. "We're running out of food due to that stupid princess' doomed Nuevo Leon expedition! It's taking our best elemental users to the corruption zone and what a surprise, BEING CORRUPTED!" ranted the guy as the group and Rasca stayed silent. "So, if everything and everyone's getting corrupted, w—we might as well try and find new sources, new portals or whatever this abyss magic does.."

"Alright, I think you've explained enough." said Rasca, as she looked at the lightners. "You do still remember where we found it?" asked Rasca as the guy nodded profusely. "Yes yeah! Uh, we found it literally here! Me and this doctor were out, trying to beat the cold and hunger when we found this strange source. Before I could accidentally be corrupted, she stopped me!" The group encounters the abyss magic stone fragment in a dilapidated hut, along with a few women and men trying to harness its power in a sort of makeshift energy refinement lab.

"I sensed its energy and stabilized it." said Rasca as the guy nodded. "Y—yeah! Thanks to the doc, we finally have some hope!" The guy suddenly felt Rasca's glare and added, "T—though, she specifically kept us at arms length before we managed to.. haha.. we're fine, right doc?" Rasca sighed, "Sure." Rasca's tablet buzzed as she looked at it, and her eyes widened. Before anyone could see what she was reacting to, she turned to leave. "I have to leave, urgent matters." excused Rasca, before running, in the snowing fields as the group watched her.

"Well, what now JR?" asked Lauvielle, as JR thinks. "Hey, dude." Ikari asks the guy, as he turns to face her. "How do you uh.. work with it anyway?" questioned Ikari, as the guy explained in the best way he can. "Um, like.. we take a small amount of abyss energy from the shard, we highly dilute it with pyro, then the abyss energy becomes this.." The guy points to a grill, in it's fuel, an unknown burning fuel'. "..'. It's.. not that stable, but it's heat.. compared to Kugol' in many uses.. Since like, we think that abyss shards contain a lot of abyss energy."

The guy finished explaining, as the group was trying very hard to not fall asleep of boredom and magical technical science talk. "Okay, okay jeez." Ikari grumbled before looking around. "Ugh, this area is quite big, instead of moping around here, let's just see what else we can do.. and hopefully, know how to deal with these guys." said Ikari to the group, a bit more hushed due to the guy, who was a bit offended of their attitude, deciding to help his comrades work instead. 

"What about Miss Tima..?" asked Urda, as she looked at the far distance, unable to see beyond the snow. "I wonder what she's doing.." Urda pondered as Lauvielle answered, "Something probably important, girl she's a doctor, maybe like she got called back in, hah!" Ikari added, "Maybe that's why she got a tablet. Though, weirdly enough we haven't met anyone else that has one." JR shrugged. "Focus on the mission, we'll question that doctor later, whoever she is.. she's powerful." JR looked at the group. "Mhm, mhm.. Fair fair." responded Lauvielle, as everybody else nodded in agreement, before walking off.

_Rasca-Cara house, @ 8:45_

Rasca gently closes the door, puts up the anti-surveillance enchantment, taking a moment to breathe then screams, "_CARA!_" as she rushed upstairs.

Rasca finds Cara, on the floor, near her bed, clutching her broken chest tightly. "Cara, queen... What. happened." asked Rasca as she assessed Cara's wounds. "Apparently, spying wasn't my forte, doc." said Cara, chuckling before gasping due to her wounds. Rasca shuddered as she grabbed her medical tools and used elemental magic to heal and stitch her synthetic body. "What did you get from it..?" asked Rasca, as it took a moment for Cara to process and also get the voice to say something.

"Something about Mijo.. I think.. He told it to some guy, I dunno, from Manecony I think.." blurted out Cara, as Rasca thought about it. "Why would Arlen be.. unless he's cooperating with... hm." Rasca is currently stitching Cara's chest wound. "He ruined my dress, hmph." Cara was trying to look at her own dress, but Rasca's.. position made her cleavage show prominently on Cara's view. "Hey get your chest off me doc, I'm trying to—" Cara gasped as another wound was fully stitched and her nervous system was restored.

"Stop moving, queen.." muttered Rasca, as Cara relaxed a bit. "Recover. Don't worry about your garments. Way easier to stitch." Rasca then moved and started using abyssal healing, moving beside Cara. "My queen, how were you.." Rasca brushed Cara's hair with her left hand while her right hand continued healing. "Apparently, my abyss magic revealed me to him." admitted Cara, as she tried to shift her position, but Rasca decided to just move her to a way more comfortable position.

"Oh, I see." Rasca then felt the heartbeat of Cara's synthetic body. "Then, he actively desires it, even when he doesn't know you're around, making you visible to him everywhere.."
