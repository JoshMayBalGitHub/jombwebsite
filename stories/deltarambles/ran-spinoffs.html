<!--FEB 29 SPINOFF FUN SHORT LORE BREAK-->
<p id="S1"><md-block># DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark</md-block></p>

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after S1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!

<!--IDEA 16 made into an actual spinoff-->

## Summary: 

When there's an important event to go to, especially where his friends are, Mijo tries magic but things go unexpected and he still has to go to the event.

## Author's Note: 

This _definitely_ doesn't say anything about me, it's just a fun idea turned into an actual story that I did because it would be fun to see this happen, might be canon, but you'll see.. anyways enjoy!

Edit 1: It has implicit sexual things, since I don't want to write one but it is the natural progression of things, so keep that in mind!

Edit 2: Oh god this is just the outline of c4s2, well as I said _**might**_ be canon, I have taken some creative liberties with this one.

Edit 3: Shit, this is starting to be my main plot, i need help.

————————————————————————————

On the day before student's night, at Jomi's library, where Mijo was sifting through some books.

"Aha! I knew it! It exists!" said Mijo before Jomi surprises him.

"What exists?" said Jomi as Mijo jumps in surprise.

"Wha— You're here?! Um, no, nothing, yeah.." said Mijo as he closed the book.

"Hmm, that book is for transfiguration.. What are you thinking..?" said Jomi, as Mijo tries to return the books quietly.

"Uhh— nothing that _you_ are thinking of! Um, I'll be going to the.. training ground! Yep. Just—" said Mijo before Jomi stops him.

"Be honest, the student night is tomorrow and you are searching for magic that can modify your looks. Right?" said Jomi, as Mijo embarrassed, nodded.

"Alright, look, Don't try to hide anything from me, because.. I know you, you keep forgetting that—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah... I am not stupid, I just.. wanted to do this by myself you know? Like it's a surprise!"

"And? You can't just go to me and teach you, even though I'll make fun of you, I'll still help you, you know?" said Jomi, as Mijo took the book about transfiguration back from the bookshelf.

"Ok. But, you're always busy! Like, I just don't wanna disturb you in any of your work, like I would do in your situation." said Mijo, now finding that specific page.

"Hmm, you know too that I would help anyways, right? But, anyway... Since it's a special day tomorrow anyway here in the dark world too, I put some of the workload to my subjects. I still did my work, I am just on my break now, and went to see you." said Jomi as Mijo agrees and shows her the page.

"This, this one specifically. I wanna make a special form I can use and hide anytime." said Mijo, as Jomi carefully inspects the page.

"Transfiguration #4.1"
As with this magic, you can use transfiguration to turn yourself into anything you can imagine and design, current testing shows you can only modify yourself, and while lookalikes are possible, you cannot maintain them for long, as you have to use your own magic, and if it is far from your own look, it will also be more. An exception is for the different versions of yourself that you automatically have based on your genetics (**sex**, height, eye and hair colour; etc)...

"Oh, did you highlight the one with.. sex? Hey, hold on.. Oh no, I know what you're going to do.." said Jomi as Mijo is now awkwardly smiling.

"Yep... I also want to modify my clothing so that it can turn into a dress that I can wear, ya know for more effort?" said Mijo, as Jomi is genuinely thinking about the whole logistics.

"Uh.. sure. Let's go to my lab." said Jomi, before Mijo said, "Wait you have a lab?!" 

"Yeah. What? Where do you think I get my potions and random stuff I give? Stealing? Well, I refine stuff there.. Anyways let's go there." said Jomi, before they walked to the lab behind Jomi's desk near her throne room.

"Huh, you have a separate desk and throne? That's weird." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and they kept going to her lab.

"Welcome, to my lab! Stay here, I think I have a potion for this..." said Jomi, as she went to her potion storage to find the transfiguration potion she needed.

"Uh sure. I am just gonna look then." said Mijo, as Jomi searched through her collection. She went up, middle, down, until she found a heart-shaped potion with an eagle-shaped gem decoration that had a blend of pink and red liquid.

"Alright, here. This should do the trick." said Jomi as she gave the potion to Mijo before Mijo accidentally spilled it on himself.

"AH! SORRY! Um, what's happening to me..?!" said Mijo, as the liquid was absorbed into his body and he turned into the female version of himself, a Jomi that was wearing full gear, with a dress for some reason.

"Ooooh, interesting... Um, sorry for.. um laughing.. Hahaha.." said Jomi, as she picked up one of her notebooks and wrote down what happened to Mijo.

"Heh? Wait! I thought that I was supposed to have a way to change it, and.. this looks permanent!" said Mijo, as he now looks upon his changed body.

"Hahaha.. This is why, you don't spill these types of potions.. Anywho, I still need to fix your mistake, soo wait.." said Jomi, as Mijo silently watches Jomi pick out a notebook she had that she started silently reading.

"Hmmm, hey can you do me a favor and go to the light world with this.. form? Umm, try to improvise i guess.." said Jomi, as she flips another page.

"Uh.. um.. you sure I can act like you?" said Mijo, as Jomi looked at Mijo and smiled and nodded.

"Uh ok.. Um do I have to go into the lab again afterwards?" said Mijo, as Jomi now puts the book back down.

"No... Just, go near my desk, I still have stuff to do.. So after I make this I'll just be at my desk." said Jomi, as she picked out a container.

"Um.. Ok. I am only doing this because I am also curious ok? I am going now.." said Mijo as Jomi laughed and nodded as she grabbed a gem-based design, with a narrow mouth and wide body.

"Uh.. Ahem.. I gotta be as fast as possible, huh.. no heels.. great! I am just gonna run as fast as I can.. _Hopefully_ nobody notices." said Mijo, as he ran with a dress that didn't interfere with his legs but still slowed him down due to his new form.

"Hey! Jomi!" called JR to an unsuspecting Mijo, now a lookalike of Jomi in anything but clothes.

"Uh.. Yes?" said Mijo, trying to sound like Jomi.

"Uh, do you know where Mijo is? I wanna talk with him about something.." said JR, looking like he has a lot to say.

"Ah— Him? He.. He's probably at the library.. Check there!" said Mijo, as he awkwardly stared at JR, waiting for his response.

"Hmm, ok! He always goes there whenever he's not at the training grounds.. Anyways, see ya!" said JR, as Mijo also said, "See ya!" to JR.

"Whew, Um.. That was unexpected so I gotta go, quick before anybody notices!" said Mijo as he traveled further down to the light world connector and got transported to the light world, seeing Rhida chilling near the entrance. Mijo now looks like a schoolgirl with a tie and dress, just like how a typical female student would of Honrato Pez.

"Oh, hi— Uh, who are you? Um wait—" said Rhida, as Mijo awkwardly waves at her and says, "Oh, ah— I am.. Jomi? Yeah.."

"You're Jomi? Wait, aren't you—" said Rhida before Mijo interrupted, "Yes, I am still the pink notebook, just um.. I have the special properties of being able to have this form while outside the dark world, yeah!"

"Oooh, you haven't told me that.. Interesting, so I can bring you with me tomorrow, or even later??" said Rhida, as Mijo tries hard to get out of the conversation.

"Um.. No, I still have important stuff to do in the dark world, I just.. wanted to test something, for more details, ask Mijo about it later!" said Mijo, as he tries desperately to go back to the dark world secretly.

"Oooh! Ok I am sure it's _very_ important so I'll leave you and Mijo to do it, remember our deal!"  said Rhida, as she continued browsing through her phone.

"Ah, thanks! I'll be going now!" said Mijo, as he finally went back, thinking what deal Jomi made and how Jomi and her were on good terms, even before she went to him, and after the incident during the previous cataclysm.

"Uh.. I'll ask Jomi later, anyways, it's pretty clear what happened, I have to go, now!" said Mijo, as he ran as fast as possible to Jomi's desk.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's desk*

Jomi was humming something as she managed her government papers, as JR entered her hall with a door connecting her lab, throne room and library.

"Woah! Jomi? I thought you were outside or something and, didn't you have like.. your battle gear on? Why do you _still_ have your... mayor suit?" said JR, as Jomi stops humming and looks at JR, surprised.

"Wha— Oh. Uh, right. Um, I just switched out of them, yeah. I am just sorting some documents now." said Jomi, surprised but understanding the situation.

"Uhuh, anyways is Mijo still behind this library? I still have something to say to him." said JR, as  Jomi nodded and JR proceeded to go in the library, closing the door behind him.

Then Mijo appeared, opening the door leading to the hall, and was heavily breathing, and shouted to Jomi, "Jomi! Jomi! We *need* to go into your lab, *now!"*

"Haha, lets be quick, JR is waiting behind that door..!" said Jomi, pointing to the library door before Mijo rushed into her lab, as Jomi follows closely and closes the door.

"Aight, you sure you want your old body back? You could just forego your old identity haha.." said Jomi sarcastically as she grabbed the potion from earlier that she made.

"Yes, of course! Wh— I mean, I still need to attend school and I can't exactly register you as a student so—" answered Mijo, before Jomi suddenlt gives him the potion. "Yeah, yeah I am joking, I wouldn't wanna know how that works, anyway.." said Jomi, before Mijo drank the potion and afterwards, put it in a nearby table. "This is a temporary fix, since developing the potion that instantly changes clothes and body, et cetera.. Takes more time, so what I am doing is using your current clothes, but you change form depending on.. your glasses!"

"Wha— My glasses..? So, like.. woah!" said Mijo before he suddenly changed form to his old self, with his usual dark world clothing. "So.. If I understand correctly, my.. other form is my actual body, and this is like a disguise for now?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "Yep, that means if you even separate yourself from your glasses, you'll turn to a girl! This is the price you pay for ruining my glass, now I'll actually have to steal from someone haha.."

"Don't! So, like.. How long does this.. potion take to make?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi cleans the potion and puts it back in the empty containers. "Hmm, I'll tell you when it's done, now get out, JR's waiting for you lol." answered Jomi, as she pushes Mijo out and closes the lab door. "Hey! You use lol IRL?! Bruh—" said Mijo to the lab door, as JR pats his back to get his attention.

"H—huh? Oh, hi..! I was just talking with Jomi about a book I found, what do you want..?" asked Mijo, as JR looks at him with disapproval before saying, "Uhuh.. Anyway, I have to talk to you about something.. Is she going out of that.. back room of hers?"

"Uh.. probably? Let's talk in the library then." said Mijo, just as they walked to the library and headed for a nearby seating.

"So, is there any reason why you haven't been out of the library for.. the entirety of the intramurals? Like, after that day, whenever I asked Jomi where were you, she said here, so I am simply curious.. What are you studying, maybe I can help..?" asked JR, as Mijo tries to hide his embarrassment at his words. "Oh.. yeah.. Sorry, just kinda busy, y'know.. Abyss Doctor stuff, so I have just been preparing.. I mean, I do go out, just not when you're around I guess.." answered Mijo, as he looks over at the part near the transfiguration book.

"Hmm..? Alright, yeah.. the abyss doctor.. I wonder when he'll come back... Well, that's... Hm... Sige, I'll leave you to it. Pag kailangan mo, we're here. Anyways, this new mushroom based attack, Imma see if I can do it.." said JR, as he stood up and left the library. "Good luck! *sigh* Now what.. I am basically a different person inside.. Ugh.. How does it even work..? Like, is it frozen in time or something.. or.. I don't even want to know.." mutterred Mijo to himself as he contemplated his life decisions.

"Hey! Mijo! Our daily sparring match? Did you forget?" asked Urda, as she entered the library. "O—oh! Yeah, lets go." responded Mijo, as he walked up to her and they walked to the training ground.

"Same as before, magic healthbar and no holding back, ok?" said Urda, as they prepared their weapons. "Alright, let's dance!" shouted Mijo, before they started their spar with Urda pressing a button to do so.

First, Mijo acted first slashing his way near Urda, before stunning her with his summoning slashes, as he follows it up with a slash up, so she gets knocked up, and as she is up, he quickly slashes her as he brings her down. Then he quickly teleports away, as before she could act, he managed to get a few more slashes in. Urda decides to use her gun to fire projectiles at Mijo, as he teleports and dodges all of them, as he gets the jump at Urda, quickly slashing her as Urda tries to block. Then he comes back and keeps putting pressure as she is unable to act as he keeps slashing and stabbing her. As he moves away, Urda decides to use her gun to blast in his general direction, he easily dodges and manages to keep bringing her healthbar down. Then as Urda decides to use wind to keep herself up and to block his shots, he decides to use his ultimate and break through space to deal a lot of damage. She falls down and Mijo deals a lot of damage to her as she is stunned by this amount of damage, by using his big sword and enhanced unarmed combat wear. Then as she finally has a chance to breathe, he uses his ultimate again, finishing the spar with him winning. 

"Haha.. you uh.. having a good day today.. I guess.. Whew.. And this close to student's night.." said Urda, as she sits down at the ground, exhausted. "Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I was that perfect, anyways.. What.. else..?" responded Mijo, as he also sits down, tired.

"I don't know, honestly.. Wanna get some food? Our spars just consume a lot of our energy.. so yeah." asked Urda, with a bit of hesitation. "Honestly, what time even is it.. I was so caught up with.. everything.. Just in general, abyss doctor stuff, my personal stuff, the school stuff, a lot.." said Mijo, not answering her question.

"Uh.. it's.. 2:30 PM in the light world.. What's on your mind, you can tell me... I won't judge!" said  Urda reassuringly, as she moves closer to him.
"Uh.. well, it's a secret, ok? I.. really am embarrassed about it.. I just don't wanna say _anything_ about it.." responded Mijo, as he tries to stay composed.

"Are you suuure..? I basically know most of your secrets, like Jomi.. Rhida.. you know what I mean." asked Urda, as she persistently bothers Mijo about it. " *sigh* Fiiine. Hold on, lemme stand up." said Mijo, acquiescing to her request. So he stood up, walked a few steps away from her and took off his glasses to reveal his actual form, with longer hair to the shoulder, a bigger chest area, and a more feminine body type, like Jomi's but with a bit more muscle.

"W—woah!! Are you actually Jomi?" questioned Urda, before Jomi appeared behind her, answering "Maybe..!", as she jumps up and sees the two, the only difference between them being how they style themselves. With Jomi, a more formal and royal purple look, while Mijo with his usual dark red and blue contrasting each other with a rough look.

"H—huh?! Two Jomis?!" questioned Urda, as Mijo wore his glasses again, turning him back to this 'old self'. "No.. Just a lil' magic that Mijo personally requested.. Anyways, I am going.. I just wanted to _check in..!_ " answered Jomi before she left, her steps being noticed by the other two.

"O—oh, whew.. Wait.. what magic?!" shouted Urda, before Jomi was far enough to not hear or see them. "Transformation Magic... That's what I've been busy with for a few days.. actually." answered Mijo, as Urda gasped at this answer. "No way..! So that's what you've been doing in the library! What's the reason..?" asked Urda, as Mijo comes closer to Urda.

"Just.. an experiment, that's all! I swear." said Mijo, as Urda chuckles. "Really..? Are you suure? Because I think there's a lot more to this than you say.." said Urda, teasing him again. "I am sure, alright.. one more round?" responded Mijo, standing up again.

"Haha.. Sure, but I want your girl form, deal?" said Urda, before Mijo reluctantly nodded and took off his glasses. "My glasses are for style points anyway, since getting this new form I have been able to see without it." responded Mijo, before he got his weapons ready.

"Coool, I should look into it, then." said Urda, as she started the spar, with health bars popping up.

They have a standoff as they look at each other intently for a while, before Mijo makes the first move, starting with his big slash using his big sword to slash as it gets deflected by Urda. Then he jumps high to the air and summons slashes against Urda as he does a big final slash, as he manages to get a small knock back as he lands. Suddenly Urda's blade clashed with Mijo's as he was knocked back and managed to backflip as he landed on his feet as he was knocked into the air and knocked back down with a combo from Urda. He then managed to switch to his other sword as he deflected a follow up attack and countered as he maintained his ground. Then they locked blades as they looked at each other intently before a quick deflect from Mijo due to a quick shot from Urda, pushed each other away. They both try to use their own ultimates as the two simultaneously attack each other and as it finishes, Mijo is noticeably lower in health. Urda tries to blast and maneuver Mijo as much as she can, as Mijo dodges, parries and counters her attack. Then Mijo attacks with a very risky move, moving to stab Urda straight at the heart as Urda brings down his health little by little, as he managed to get an opportunity and as she notices, she decides to counter and as the two stab each other in the chest, the game's over with Urda winning the duel.

Heavy breathing from both sides as both pull out their weapons. "Man, if we were just a little more risky, we could have damaged each other for real.." said Mijo, as he lay down on the floor. "Yeah.. Good game to you, but I managed to have enough health to tank that before you lost." responded Urda, as she also sits on the floor.

"Mhmm.. Well, what time is it? It's probably time to go home for today.." asked Mijo, as Urda responded, "Uhh oh, it's 3:30 PM, we should head back, it's a Thursday.. I don't know about you, but our sir is particularly strict, so I gotta go.. See you tomorrow!", as she waves Mijo goodbye as she walks back to enter the light world. He picks up his glasses and starts walking out of the training ground.

"I should head back too, a lot of prep is needed, and I am kinda tired too." muttered Mijo as he walked his way near the exit of the dark world. "Hey~" said Jomi, as she surprises Mijo again with a smile. "H—huh?! Oh, uh.. Jomi.. what do you want?" responded Mijo, as Jomi shows herself in front of him.

"Sooo what do you think..? Any.. complaints?" asked Jomi, as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah, are you done with the potion?"

"No.. I would've told you, anywho... I can see your hesitance and.. conflicted mind. So, I will say that you'll have an... interesting night ahead of you, don't worry.. I am working on it, just see me next week, ok?" responded Jomi, as Mijo sighs heavily and says, "Yeah, yeah.. I am.. just curious, does the.. change of clothes like earlier before the temporary potion, work now?"

"Should be the same, haha.. I can already tell in your eyes what you're thinking, all of it.. Try it, you'll have time to try before tomorrow, and... oh! Yeah, uh.. as for any side effects beside the obvious, this type of magic actually affects _those_ areas, but I'll need more time to figure out specifics, so hey! Why not try everything you've always wanted to try, maybe you'll learn something!" explained Jomi, before winking and gesturing Mijo to leave. "Ugh.. I sure do love and hate having someone like you around.. Anyway, then.. see you next week!" said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other.

As he goes out of the dark world and closes the portal for the next few days, he knows that he can't get there tomorrow and then the weekends too. He goes into their classroom and gets his bag as he sees his friends, Ikari already go out, and Lauvielle talking to somebody else. He then picks up his bag and leaves as his other classmates continue cleaning the room. He then checks the time, and it looks like it's 15:50, as he feels the breeze of the wind. He then looks at his phone, and stares at the home screen, knowing if he presses anything he won't ever get out of the internet spiral. Then his thoughts move on to his notes app, maybe he should start a diary of this, or maybe he should continue that memoir disguised as fantasy fiction of his adventures, but as he thinks of this, a certain JR comes up to him, as he exits the classroom.

"Hey. I have a question, is there going to be a chance to open and close the dark world during the morning, before the preparations for students night eventually take over?" asked JR, as Mijo is snapped out of his thoughts and looks at JR and answers, "Maybe.. I'll try to be early tomorrow, but you know me.. Since I largely don't care about the morning 'year-end party', I can maybe sneak it in before it officially starts.. Urda's probably busy with her class, but she might come up.. we'll see."

"Ok. Goodbye. See you tomorrow!" said JR, as he waved goodbye, going out of Mijo's vision by turning a corner. "Oh, right.. I might not care about the morning, but the night.. People say that.. to enjoy this once-a-year event in school, since you only ever get 6 times before it isn't the same anymore, but.. I.. really have well, no one else to _enjoy_ the night, my friends have their own dance, and the others might either leave or hangout with the others, since they're more.. confident?" muttered Mijo to himself, as he leans on a railing overlooking the school near his room.

"This new body too, Jomi's always vague with her words, but.. can't blame her honestly.. It's something I would do if I saw someone go through my situation. Anyways, times like these.. I always think about it, but.. there's just..  little things that I actually change. Huh.. Time often is wasted away by me, but.. I guess this is technically just waiting for my dad to pick me up, but what I could be doing during that time.. It's so much more than.. now. I think my often self-reflections are good, but then I should do something about it, it gets worse since I don't even share this, at least.. not willingly..." said Mijo to himself, as behind him his classmates finish cleaning, lock the classroom and leave.

"Oh, I should go down, and.. *sigh* Rhida's gone.. Welp, my chance with her is gone, anyways.. anything I want to do isn't until I go home, so imma just play some mobile videogames, like.. oooh! A companion game to Shingen Inpakuto, Honkstar Railway!" said Mijo, as he walked down the stairs as he went to a nearby unofficial waiting area that was just a student hangout place that was coincidentally close to the school gate.

He eventually decided to go and walk home. As he settles down in his bed, as he does the usual change to home clothes. Then he goes to his room that had his computer setup, since his house was built with separate shared bedrooms and other rooms used for work or school-related stuff.

"Whew.. Finally home and I can.. experiment. Hopefully they don't notice, or don't just enter my room without noise, I don't really wanna lock it since I'll have to explain why, and.. hopefully I can get this done and then, rest and watch some videos, play some games, et cetera.." muttered Mijo to himself as he enters another room that's used for extra bed space and storage for other people.

"Ok, first.. The obvious first thing that any person would do if they switched bodies is check.. this." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and then his pajamas. "Uh.. well, I guess I should.." said Mijo, as he took off his shirt.

Meanwhile in the living room, May and June, his parents are talking about work stuff. 

"Then, this girl was complaining about the foods that the campaign manager gave her since the other side had larger portions, while I was just listening intently trying to be discreet in eavesdropping, afterwards we talked about it, it's just another crazy day of government office volunteering.." ranted May, as June remarks, "Yeah, that's just how people are. It's fine, they probably just got irritated by something else.. I don't want to say what that could be, since it could be anything anyway."

"Oh yeah, food's ready. Call our son." said May, before June walks to where Mijo is. 

As Mijo looks at his body, he gets the urge to see what would happen if he touched it.

"Should I..? Should I? I.. don't think there's anything else to do, I can look at the fit of different clothes later. Uh.. oh no.. that's likely dad... I should immediately dress up and confront him, it's likely dinner time.." said Mijo to himself as he quickly dressed back up, hearing his dad walk to his room. Then he sees his dad and greets him, so they can eat dinner.

Then they eat dinner, as he half-heartedly listens to his parents conversation and after a while he finishes his food. He heads off to his room again afterwards and lays down on the floor while listening to a random long video in his recommendation. 

"Ugh... I really should've just went and talked to someone after closing the dark world.. At least then, I'll have something to look forward to, aside from the food and drinks.. of course." said Mijo as he stared at the ceiling. "I could just play videogames, but Urda isn't online.. Neither is Lauvielle nor Ikari.. Hmm.. I should probably figure out what to do, but.. wait!" muttered Mijo, as he jumped up and stood on his feet.

"The experiment hasn't finished yet! Let's head to the other room again." said Mijo to himself as he walked to the other room and closed the door, making sure to lock it, since he shouldn't be expecting anyone. Then he stripped himself again, taking off his clothes and glasses.

"Ok, alright. Uh.. sooo, i mean.. what else is there to do? It doesn't have the same effect as if I either changed form fully or Jomi manages to go out of the dark world, since relatively a few things change, besides inside me but that's easy.. to hide! Anyway, I should just get on with it, since Jomi likely expects me to do this, and.. this is one of the few times that magic is brought to the light world. So, here goes nothing!" said Mijo, as he starts touching himself in the changes around the chest and crotch areas.

"Huh, that's weird. This.. _aroused_ feeling, it's weird. Is it because of my brain, or is it the magic..? I am going to.. lay down on the bed." said Mijo, as he lay down on the bed pushing away his clothes. "Ugh.. Mmm.. I'm going to stop, I've promised myself to not go too far with this, I.. think it's enough. My.. breathing is noticeably faster and so is my heartbeat.. I.. I am gonna pass out." said Mijo, as he unexpectedly closed his eyes due to mixed euphoria and dizziness that he felt. After an hour or two, a knock is heard at the door as May calls on Mijo, "Mijo! Mijo! Your clothes for tomorrow! Try it out!"

"H—huh..? Oh shi.. Right, the students night! Oh no—" said Mijo as he quickly dresses up and gets his glasses, transforming himself back. "Yeah! Coming! Wait a sec!" shouted Mijo back, as May responded, "Ok! I'll be waiting in the living room!"

"Whew.. Uh.. What happened..? One moment, I was just.. exploring and.. uh.. y—you know what, I am just going to ignore that and quickly go to where she is." said Mijo, before he opened the door, grabbed his phone and left to go to the living room.

"So here's the clothes for the year-end party in the morning, then we switch it out with this one for students night in the afternoon until midnight. Try it out!" said May, as she gestured to Mijo to try the first one. Then Mijo tried the first one as he put down his phone nearby, then went to go behind a big dresser cabinet to change as May looked at her phone, waiting for him.

"Oh no.. If she ever gets curious or wants to see me while I don't expect she could see.. welp, no point in dwelling. I just hope I get lucky." said Mijo as he tries his best to quickly change and then he reveals himself, his clothes being specifically picked out due to a theme of dark academia that the officers of his class decided, with a landslide vote for it due to the other themes not being serious.

"Oh wow, look how handsome you are in that style! What do _you_ think of it?" remarked May, as Mijo responds, "Yeah, it's fine i guess. It fits the theme for sure. Imma go try the other one." as he grabs the second one and goes behind the dresser again, and quickly changes to the second style, a dark blue polo with a large coat. Then he reveals this to his mom.

"Wow, even better.. It was a good decision to reuse those school pants since your polo is also dark blue, the coat looks nice but it might be too hot before night." said May, as Mijo nodded and asked, "Is.. that all, including the rice for tomorrow's school day event?"

"Yeah, change back, and I am going to prepare each of them for tomorrow, have fun tomorrow anak!" said May, as Mijo went and changed back and left to go back to his room after grabbing his phone again. "Whew.. Ok, that's done. Now, where were we.. Oh right, the whole.. experiment. What time even is it?" said Mijo, as he checks the time and sees it is 20:30, it is usually when he and Urda played games, but when he checked her profile, she was offline and most likely accidentally fell asleep again.

"Oh, well. Let's go back to experimenting, I better not lose my mind again." said Mijo, as he put down his phone and headed off to the other room. Then he closed the door, locking it again, then undressed again, taking off his clothes and glasses. "Ok, so.. uh.. I am just gonna continue and stop when it affects me, because.. whatever happened earlier, the memories are far too dizzy to be a success in exploring." said Mijo, before he touched himself in the chest and crotch areas again, then after some short somewhat unintentionally sensual touches, he laid down in the bed again, trying to process and stay conscious, with the same effect as before, heavy breathing, faster heartbeat, and subconscious moving on his hips and legs.

"Wha— What..? Why.. Is this... I.. ugh.. I am going to.. mmm.. just try to stay still, and.. yeah.." said Mijo, as he tried to stay conscious and experience the euphoria of pleasure as well as the overwhelming sense of dizziness from the sudden experience. "Whew.. Come on, stay determined.. Don't lose focus.. just like before.. ahh.. uh.. ok, i am gonna, ah!" said Mijo as he tries to move his body accidentally touching his other parts, stopping him from continuing to move.

"I.. don't think this is normal.. While it.. has some similarities from what I've read.. this is way too.. extreme. What was.. in those two potions? I guess... this is... somewhat brand new.. at least, inferring from Jomi's vague wording..." said Mijo as he stayed still, attempting to wait out the sensation. He waits for a while, but the feeling never goes away, although it is less intense than before.

"Hah.. I can't keep this up, while.. it's so.. intoxicating.. I can't keep this for long.. Wait.. I have to write it down.. My phone..!" said Mijo, as he attempts to go out of bed and get to his phone, as he unlocks the door.

"Just... have to.. get this.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he grabbed his phone and walked quickly as fast as he could, with being dizzy and not having clothes on, and locked his door again, then he stumbles back to his bed, beginning to close his eyes. "No.. I.. have to, go to my notes app, and.. ugh.. No.. video?" said Mijo, as he looked at his phone and focused on the notes then the camera app.

"Ok, record.. Listen, Mijo.. Don't save this video nor should you let anyone but yourself see this, you've made this phone for yourself so.. anything that you see, write it down please.. Now.. no.. uh.. my.. storage.." said Mijo as he closed his eyes and fell unconscious, as the camera continued recording. Then after 2 hours, he finally wakes up in a daze.

"Huh.. Hah? Hah! What? I am still in this form.. and my phone? Oh no, my storage.. It's been recording for two hours, let's see what it recorded." said Mijo, as he stopped the recording and looked at the video, it replayed the first part, the whole message then after losing consciousness, after two minutes, he suddenly sees himself move his hands to the crotch and chest area and moan a bit before he paused and turned the screen off. "N—no... We are not watching me.. doing that for 2 hours. But.. ugh.. is that even me? Is.. Is that me? Is that what I did.. But.. why don't I remember this..? Like.. it's all hazy and dizzy, vaguely pleasurable but.. *sigh* I don't know.. and.. it's 23:30 too.. It's almost time to sleep so I can be early tomorrow..", as he lays down on the bed.

"I.. should check my.. huh?" said Mijo, as he looks into his notifications and sees messages from Urda 1 hour ago. 

Urda: Hey bro wanna play some Shingen Inpakuto? 
Let's do that new character's story quest like that girl with a gun that is a guard?
Oh you might be busy that's fine! I'll save it for saturday then, I'm just going to play in our Digmake Server! You'll have a surprise ;)

"Digmake? Like... the server we paid for 500 pesos? Huh.. It's a sandbox survival game, I wonder what she's trying to do.. blow up my house with TNT? Or replace it with a dirt house? Oh well. It was an hour ago, she must be still there.. But, I still have to continue my Shingen dailies!" said Mijo, as he went out of his bed and dressed up as he got his glasses and he transformed back. "Then let's get my phone and play some Shingen, then hop on the server!" muttered Mijo, as he grabbed his phone then went out of the room as he closed the door.

He went to his computer and started playing videogames, enjoying his time in Shingen and Digmake as he kept his phone charged and off. After a while, he eventually stopped playing and said goodbye to Urda as they logged off the night. He checked the time, and it was 0:30, an hour after the second experiment. He decides it was probably time to sleep and does the routine of cleaning and closing the room for the night before he heads off to his bed. As he does some chores before he heads off to bed, he listens to some videos as he tries to put the events before in the back of his mind, as it brings up memories that he prefers not to think of for now. 

Then he heads off to bed and sleeps, trying to move on and hopefully have a normal day tomorrow, although he sleeps without his glasses and he also grabs a long blanket to hopefully conceal any noticeable changes from his mother since she sleeps near him on another bed in the same room. As he sleeps, he begins to dream about the special events vaguely happening as it distorts to Jomi noticing and watching. In his dream, it is distorted to have more sensual and pleasure than what actually happened as he begins to imagine Jomi observing then ignoring him. Then after 6 hours, he wakes up with a phone alarm playing, as he turns it off with a morning look.

"Agh.. Welp, I guess it's time. I better get my glasses and—" said Mijo, as someone is heard closing on him. "Not this time!" muttered Mijo to himself as he wears his glasses and transforms back. His father arrives and leaves due to seeing him clearly awake so he got out of bed, grabbed his phone and headed off to eat. He eats and then he goes off to shower, not forgetting to transform once inside the shower since it is hidden from anyone else, he notices the changes to how he showers due to the transformation, but he keeps focused at his routine. After showering, he grabs his towel and wears his glasses as he heads off to another room and dresses up as he watches his surroundings making sure no one sees him until he's done. Then he went to the living room to grab his shoes and school I.D.

"I'm just going to clean this.." said June, as he takes the glasses of Mijo to properly clean it with anti-fogging liquid with a large microfiber cloth. He noticed this immediately but he didn't want to draw attention as his chest was getting heavier on his clothes. He continued putting on his shoes as his father finished cleaning and put it down on the table as Mijo grabbed it before June looked at him again, as he transformed back. He then left to go and prepare their vehicle as Mijo put his phone in his sling bag, grabbed his things, looked himself in the mirror then promptly grabbed his face mask then left as May went out of the room to grab something as she noticed Mijo leave. "Bye anak!" said May, as they both wave goodbye to each other.

Then he went to his dad, so they drove to school. As this happens, Mijo is checking on his phone for messages in the classroom GC about the party, then he looks at the rice container that his classmates asked him to bring. Then he checks the other GC to see Urda telling him that she barely managed to get the time to open the dark world before being dragged into her classroom for the class by class party. Then he was dropped off at school as they waved goodbye to each other and he went into school. He brought his rice container on the way, walking up stairs, into their classroom before sneakily going out and jumping in the dark world nearby. He lands to find no one nearby.

"W—wait.. Where is everybody..? Jomi usually meets me here.. Hmm, though she could be just in her castle but.. then where's the bustling atmosphere..?" remarked Mijo, as he walked to Jomi's castle. He then noticed some guards at the entrance as he was stopped by them. "Her Majesty Jomi isn't allowing any lightners nor any of us to enter the castle!" said one of the guards.

"Then where's the others? Where's Jomi?" questioned Mijo, as the guards looked at each other and gave Mijo a piece of paper with Jomi's handwriting.

Hey, If you see this, this means that I have left the castle with some guards to deal with some abyss threats. I am currently writing this in the downtime, but as for now, there was a sudden surge of abyss attacks that just happened, and so I've been focusing my efforts there, sorry if I couldn't be there and I promise I'll be there next time, until then.. follow my orders and leave for now. The other people have either joined me or have joined the other guards in protecting and making shelter. The timeframe is this day, that includes your students night, so good luck there and have fun! 

— signed by Jomi (The Princess~)

"O—oh.. I see.. I'll have to inform the others, have you seen any other lightner?" asked Mijo, as the other guard answered, "We saw Miss Urda enter first and then Sir JR entered before they went to us, we explained the situation then they left."

"I see. I'll go now. Good luck soldiers." said Mijo, as the other guards saluted as he left and returned to the light world. He went out and closed the dark world as JR was waiting for him outside their classroom.

"Hey, you closed the dark world, right?" asked JR, as Mijo nodded and leaned into the wall nearby him. "Well, Jomi said something about the abyss threats, and you said you've been researching about the abyss and the abyss doctor. Soo, any information you can.. share?" asked JR, as Mijo thought about it and answered, "Uh.. Well, I've also been reading about him and have been talking with Jomi a lot, however this one was unexpected, not even we expected it, so I am just waiting until next week or later to see what happens."

"I see, I was also wondering but couldn't ask anyone knowledgeable enough, such as you, or Jomi. Hmm.. Wouldn't this dark world crisis affect the party today?" asked JR, as Mijo answered, "I think so, but I don't know when it will erupt so I guess we have to stay vigilant."

"Welp, I guess we just enjoy until battle is necessary then, are you.. coming in the classroom?" questioned JR, as Mijo smiles and responds, "Just tell them that I am sick or something, I.. got a disguise..!" as he reveals his transformation by taking off his glasses.

"Oh! oh? Magic works in the light world?" questioned JR, as Mijo showed off and answered, "Think so, you'll have to ask Jomi—" as they both say, "But she is busy!"

"Yeah! She is. Anyways, what do you think?" asked Mijo as JR inspects Mijo, "You look like Jomi in a suit honestly." remarks JR, as Mijo nodded and said, "That's true. Anyways are you going in? It looks like it's starting."

"Yeah, uh good luck I guess." said JR, as he went inside and a couple of others started to call on the class. He transformed back to his other form, and chilled outside of the classroom, as he scrolled on his phone. He messages the GC saying that the dark world was closed due to abyss threats and that they should stay vigilant but be informed. He goes back to scrolling his phone.

After a lot of doing nothing, he decides to transform and check out the school, making sure to watch out for other people. There were surveillance cameras, but to the cameras it looked like there was just a student that was walking around, and there could be many reasons why so he also thought of reasons if he ever gets questioned. He is particularly going to a demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it.

"Hey, uhh where _is_ Mijo? Doesn't the message in the GC say that the dark world was closed? Then where is he?!" questioned Ikari, as she sits in a chair in the classroom, as she's talking to Lauvielle. "I don't know.. I was going to ask JR, but he seems busy.." responded Lauvielle, as JR is talking to someone else about something. "And you two have.." said Ikari, before Lauvielle said, "Yeah.. we uh.. have somewhat of a falling out due to our research project having some issues, you get it, Mijo talked about it in our 3-person GC."

"Oh look, he seems to be finished. I'll go ask, he sees me less.. negatively. Than you at least." said Ikari, ss Lauvielle nodded and watched Ikari go towards JR. "Yeah, the zoo party game was a total mess. I don't wanna know what they thought would happen when a bunch of highschoolers scream at each other to find their 'group'." said JR, as Ikari overhears this and says to JR, "Hey JR, I have a question."

"Oh? Yeah, what is it?" asked JR before Ikari answers, "Where is.. Mijo? He uh.. told us about.." she looks around and continues, "the dark, yeah. And I was wondering if.. no, where he is?"

"Oh. Hm." responds JR as he also looked around, before answering, "He's.. hmm, check the GC. I'll post there."

"Oh, ok. I'll await it then." said Ikari, as she goes back near Lauvielle. "Oh? My phone? Ah ok.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari nudges her to check her phone. They go to the gc to see JR typing until a message appeared:

JR: As for @Mijo's whereabouts, he told me to tell you guys he's sick but we know that's codeword for he's not going to attend class for a reason, likely the reason why the dark world was closed, staytuned he might need us

"Oh, so he's like on a quest again, like what Urda told us Jomi is on... They really are.." said Lauvielle, before Ikari interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I get it. Hmm, I'm kinda bored.. Why don't we help Mijo? Let's say we want to go the CR, I am sure they won't care."

"Uh... ok. Tara." said Lauvielle as the two excused themselves from the classroom party and headed outside. "Easy. Let's.. huh, who is that?" questioned Ikari, as she looks over to a girl who is headed to the ruins of a demolished building. 

Meanwhile, Mijo has entered the ruins of the demolished area, as he uses his transformation to avoid anyone recognizing him. He was particularly interested how spacious it was and how it was ignored and there has been no effort to close it off. "Huh, this is interesting.. You know, if there was a boss fight here, it would have the space! But.. I am sure nothing bad will happen.. please?" said Mijo to himself, as he heard a loud thud behind his back. "Aw man.." said Mijo, as he turned around to see a dark abyss figure materialize in front of him. "And.. Where's my weapons? Uh, oh no." said Mijo, as he tried to summon his weapons with no response. "You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "Oh no, uh.. stick? That will do." said Mijo, as he grabbed a long wooden stick to protect himself. The dark figure immediately sprung to slash him, easily breaking his stick and forcing him back. "I am soo fucked." said Mijo as he looked at the dark figure walking at him intimidatingly. "Welp, I guess it was good while it lasted.." said Mijo, as the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground, as the other two watched at the sidelines.

"T—that abyss monster just killed her! W—we have to get everyone here!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari got her phone to quickly call the others. "Wait.. where's Mijo then? He's supposed to handle stuff like this.." asked Ikari, as they both frantically call their GC. "If he was here, he wouldn't be able to do anything?! We don't have our own magic, so he doesn't but.. how did they appear?!" responded Lauvielle, as the dark figure looked at them menacingly. 

"Ah! Let's run!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari already started running as soon as the dark figure looked. "H—hey! Wait up!" shouted Lauvielle as she ran to Ikari's position.

Meanwhile, Mijo wakes up at an unknown dark space with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center. "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and to the ground, then he falls to the ground. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword and summoned the hilt as through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up..." said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two help Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "Y—yeah! Uh, JR told us you used transformation magic so we know that form, a—and.. we called as much backup as possible. I know you probably went here with the intention of not getting us involved, but.." explained Lauvielle before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others try to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summons a sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and kills the dark figure, making it dissapear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others look at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?" said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they waved goodbye to Mijo. As he rested and reflected, Urda, Rhida and Ikari were coincidentally right next to each other as the others left.

"Hey, you two.. You uh.. worried about Mijo? He seems to be.. well, going through a lot. I am not sure what he went through as he was.. in my arms but.. seeing his.. transformation and the fact that he hasn't even tried to get his stuff yet, I am.. concerned." said Rhida to the other two as they look at Mijo still staring off into the distance. "Yeah.. But, if you're thinking that we can help him, you should probably exclude me. I am the worst at.. comforting people, and he even comforts me a lot of the time... anyways, my dad's calling. See you two later!" responded Ikari as she left waving goodbye at the other two. "Is.. she saying the truth?" asked Rhida to Urda, as Urda shrugs and answers, "I don't know honestly.. I don't know much about her besides being her research partner, after she switched with her old one.. Mijo told me it was for complicated reasons but.. Lauvielle left early so I can't ask anyone else besides him."

"Uhuh.. Well, someone has to give him his stuff, and the rice container he brought.. Apparently his contribution to the party of his section..?" said Rhida, finding a way to smile amidst her troubled emotions. "Haha, well. I could do it, I guess.. But.. considering previous events.. You should do it." responded Urda, as Rhida blushed and says, "Huh? What? No no way..! Haha, even considering that.. You should do it, you were friends with him longer!"

"Hah? Really, are you missing this opportunity? Come on, sis its like a chance to dance with somebody, like the song they played at the mass demo for some reason.. I got this, you know.. like, I won't be jealous, ok?" retorts Urda, trying to hide her feelings. "I—is that— No way, I am.. not that confident, well no I am confident, just.. that we have a lot of baggage ok? You get it, and his parents might be calling him!" responds Rhida, as she looks over to Mijo then back to Urda. "Right, and that's why you should get this stuff and give it to him, and as he checks his belongings, you can ask him about—" said Urda, before being interrupted by Rhida, "W—what? You have experience? Like you've been trying to see if he likes you back by doing only subtle things to not ruin your relationship?"

"N—no... You're projecting your own actions, I.. uhh don't have any feelings, ok? Just, platonic pure gamer buddies.. always have.. been... Yep..." responds Urda, as she sits down on a nearby chair, now more troubled. "Um.. I.. think we have our own unresolved issues.. I.. didn't know you.. I'll go now." said Rhida, as she gives more space to her and Urda. Then as soon as Rhida was far enough, Mijo finally stood up and saw the two far away from each other, and his things at a table near the two girl's things.

"You two, are you still waiting for your parents?" asked Mijo, as he grabbed his things and checked his phone. The two girls tried to say something, but they fell short on what to say. "I see. Well, here's my glasses.. and oh look, perfect timing, my parents are on the way, judging by the time, they should be near.." continued Mijo, as he wore the glasses, transformed to his old form and was still looking at his phone. "I.. guess I'll be the first one. My parents are here, so.. Um.. hey, uh Mijo. Once the party happens, come meet me at the spot near the CR's, you'll know when.. I.. think. I gotta go now, see you two later!" proposed Rhida as she left, and waved goodbye as Mijo turned his attention to Urda.

"Oh, my turn.. again. Well, I am.. embarassed to say it, but to just confirm, you heard the entire convo earlier, right?" questioned Urda, as Mijo chuckles and answers, "Yeah, unwittingly.. I was going to grab my stuff but, I noticed you three talking so I stayed until done.."

"Oh. Oh. I am.. uh.. it took this long to reveal it huh.. Even after I thought you moved on.. Well, thanks for staying true to me all those times.. I—it's my fault, i guess.. I had.. romantic feelings for you, I should've just told you directly. But, you got her, Rhida.. And, we're just bestfriends." continued Urda, as she teared up a little. "I.. should go.. My parents are calling me and.." said Urda, before Mijo hugged her for a while before she broke away and says, "Thanks. Even though I know what your feelings are, you're still willing to give this.. girl something to hold onto. Goodbye, see ya." said Urda as she waved goodbye before Mijo also went home making sure to not bother her after she turned around and he started walking because his parents were there way earlier than  he expected.

He went home and rested on his bed as he stared at the ceiling, processing the events. He checked the GC to see the messages, there's only from Urda;

Urda: @everyone the current crisis has been temporarily fixed by the Mijo and the gang so enjoy your students night until another one appears lol

"Huh, ok.. Guess I don't need to message then." said Mijo, as he closed his phone and drifted to sleep, as he was still exhausted from the battle. He entered a dream where he was transported to school as he was about to enter it.

"Welp, just another day. Let's go." said Mijo, as he walked until he saw a certain girl that was facing the flag pole, that was directly ahead of him, so she was turned away from him. So he walked to the girl and questioned, "Uh.. who are you?"

"Oh, You don't know? I am you." said the girl, as Mijo responded, "Well, what's your name then?" as she chuckled and said, "It doesn't matter, Jomi.. Mijo.. I am still you..!"

"So, Jomi? What are you doing here? Is this the dark world from my first time, or the light school, the one that's.. real y'know?" questioned Mijo, as the girl responded, "Hmm, it's a bit different, how about you see for yourself..?" said the girl as she disappeared and Mijo quickly turned to see Urda at the open gymnasium. "Uh.. hey?" asked Mijo as he walked up to Urda, she was silent. "Hey..? You ok? You can tell me everything.." continued Mijo, as Urda started crying. "H—hey.. It's fine, just tell me. Please." asked Mijo as he became more distressed and worried. She continued crying for a while as Mijo tried to comfort her but to no avail. She stopped crying suddenly, and as she looked around and saw him, with a sad expression. "Oh, you're here.. I thought you'd already left.. Haha.. Everyone always.. drifts, and.. I am always alone. You get it, right?  Feeling alone while there's so many people around, and being able to make bonds that break every year.. And, the worst part is.. rejection. Haha, I feel like I am hopelessly drifting in life, and when you get that one connection and it just dies..?"

"I.. I.. I know, but.. is this about earlier? I am sorry, ok..? I just.. don't feel the same, even before I transformed. That's why I did actually, but.. I did suspect you for a while, then I thought you moved on.. Should I have—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupted, "No, actually It's all my fault. I don't think I'll ever get it right, and we're separated now right? It doesn't matter. Your words.. mean nothing to me now. I should've stayed by myself, relying on no one. For that, this.. dark power, is mine. I'll create something better.", as she held an unknown source of abyss power.

'H—huh? That doesn't make sense..? Stop blaming yourself! And what are you doing with that power?!" shoutrd Mijo, before Urda disappeared. "Oh, is that a reflection? or nonsensical amalgamation of your worse anxieties about her?" said the certain girl as she appeared behind him. "H—huh? I don't think of her like that! I don't think she hates herself, she probably just misspoke, it will never escalate!" responded Mijo, as the certain raised her eyebrows. "Oh, then you don't get it.. Let me show you the worst of the worst.." said the girl as she made Urda, Rhida and Jomi appear. "W—wait?! Then who are you?" questioned Mijo, as he looked at the three with different looks.

First, from the right to the left, Urda had both of her guns out with a dark blue aura, as well as floating double sword, with a neutral and numb face. Jomi had her long hair on her shoulders with a dark purple aura and a neutral face as she held a hilt at one hand and a blue fireball in the other hand. Rhida had her eyes whitened out as she floats with ice all around her as she wieled an ice sword. "What is this? Why are they just standing around?" questioned Mijo, as the certain girl's voice spoke to him, "These are your worst nightmares!" as the three suddenly teleport near him and start attacking. "My sword!" said Mijo, as he wielded a sword and deflected and parried their attacks as their relentless attacks wear down Mijo, before Jomi stabbed him at his heart. 

"Ah! Ugh.. I.. why.. what.. is this.. a dream?" said Mijo, as he was forced to stand up with immense pain as he looked at the three. "A dream, you needed to know. Now, let us set a scene.." said Jomi, as she set a chair she manifested as the others hold Mijo down. "I.. What is this supposed to be?! Jomi? You should understand, let me out!" shouted Mijo, as Jomi imprisoned her with dark magic. "This, is.. what you deserve." said Jomi, as the three of them tortured Mijo intensely with immense pain as it stayed like this for a while, as he woke up in a cold sweat, tears in his eyes and heavily breathing.

"What was that?! I.. what.. Who.. was that..? And.. I.. can't.. it's just a dream.. right? Haha, yeah.. It's nothing, it.. doesn't represent anything, haha..? I.. uh.. don't.. have anything to talk about, I don't think that dream's real, its just weird hehe.. I.. yeah sure.. Huh? My phone.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he checked his phone to see a message from Urda and Rhida. "Oh, it's them. I better go check their messages." said Mijo as he checks Urda's first. 

Urda: Bro I just got a dream where you like guide me to the school and you got Rhida to freeze my legs then you got Jomi and Rhida to beat me up as you looked at me having a smug face, then you decided to tie me to chair to have me be beat up by you idk if its like special but it wasn't like my other dreams so it could be dark world magic or something

"Oh. Lemme look at Rhida's then." said Mijo as he checks Rhida's message.

Rhida: Idk who to share this to but it includes you so i just had a dream where Jomi guided me to the school then she disappeared as then you appear me completely ignoring me as Urda and Jomi appear behind me to pull me away as you moved closer to me still ignoring me as Urda and Jomi try to beat me up and when I try to stop them you appeared stopping me and making me lose my footing as i fall to the ground and get dragged and tied up as the others bear me up its weird and so extreme but i think you might know what it entails

"Huh. Really? Interesting. They had the same dream but.. Jomi's there and that girl wasn't.. that's weird. I better check with Jomi later." said Mijo, as May calls him to prepare for students night.

After dressing up for students night, wearing a dark blue polo, dark blue pants and a black coat he decided to keep in his sling bag as it was still a bit hot outside. 

"Alright, you look good. Enjoy your night, 'nak!" said May, as he checked his belongings one more time, a ticket that he found while he was going through his stuff, it was the ticket to the students night area. Then his phone, handkerchief, water bottle, and coat. He then went to school as he was brought there by his dad.

"Goodbye anak enjoy your night!" said June, as Mijo entered the school grounds, waving goodbye back as his father left. Then he went inside as a teacher checked his bag for illegal stuff before letting him in, then he went to a student goverment panel where he saw a line for his grade.

"Huh, I guess that's what this is for.. I wonder who put it in here.." said Mijo, as he pulled out his ticket from his wallet and headed to a line, after waiting and being allowed in after signing in into a document, he sat where his fellow classmates are in the left side of the gymnasium as there were thousands of chairs organized. He picked a seat near some people he was acquaintances with and sat down then he saw JR returning from the CR. He sat down soon after.

"Hey, uh who put the ticket to students night on my bag? I wasn't there the entire party, so I couldn't have received it myself.." asked Mijo, as JR smirked and answered, "It was me.. I knew you wouldn't come back anyway, so I grabbed yours and put it in your bag."

"I see.. Thanks dude. Anyways, what do you think about the 'crisis'?" asked Mijo, still using codewords about the dark world related event they experienced earlier. "Hmm, well I think that the main problem likely isn't solved yet, and that's why I am staying here. I was going to leave and not even come here, but due to the issue, as well as the student government oath, I am here." responded JR, as he thought about being elected as a workshop manager in their local school robotics club.

"Cool, cool.. Is _she_ here? asked Mijo, as JR smiled and answered, "Duh. I was actually talking to her earlier, she's right there." as he pointed to a somewhat far away seat where Rhida was talking with some of her friends. "Oh then.. Ok, I'm just going to sit here.." said Mijo, as JR nodded and spoke to other people as he looked at his phone. He saw Ikari and Lauvielle separately panicking to him about being almost late since the time is getting closer to the start of the party. He looked back to his surroundings and saw Urda come in, speaking to her friends. He quickly looked away and took a picture of the general area as he saved it. 

He decided to observe the people coming in while keeping himself busy by looking at the messages of his friends. He saw Leviente come in then Fexili, as the afternoon darkens. After a while, it was pretty much late now but a few people were still coming in. Ikari came in as she walked nearby him and sat behind a couple of chairs that were free.

"Hi! I didn't notice you enter actually, I was looking at Lauvielle's messages, It's a good thing that you arrived, before the gates closed haha." remarked Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and responded, "Yeah, I arrived before I saw your last message, anyway.., Hold on, I'm going to talk to someone else, see you later..!" as Ikari talked to someone nearby.

 He then looked at his phone then back to the people, as he was observing and waiting for the event to start. He eventually saw Lauvielle come in, but he didn't talk to her, he just saw her go and seat at a nearby free chair. He got bored and started to play videogames in his phone before the event started and he put his phone in his bag.

"Hello, hello welcome to the night of your lives! As we celebrate another end of the school year, I would like to inaugurate our new school government, and associated clubs!" said the announcer on the stage. "Oh, it looks like the student government is on their way.." said Mijo to himself, as a bunch of random people, likely officers started to stand and walk near the stage.

"Ugh.. This is boring. I might as well go to the CR now.." said Mijo to himself, as he got out of his seat and went to the CR. Then as he went to the CR he bumped into Urda before going inside. "Oh, hi." said Urda, as Mijo waved and said, "Hi.. I'm going to the CR, so.. we'll talk later!" as he excused himself to continue inside the CR as he doesn't notice Urda's saddened expression.

After finishing, he went out of the CR and decided to head back, going through the same place he bumped into Urda before sitting down and seeing the inauguration happen. " *sigh* You know what, Imma start drinking, this sucks." said Mijo, as he drank the rest of his water bottle. "Oh that's it.." said Mijo, as the inauguration finishes and the other students head back to their seat. Then their school principal starts a speech that Mijo quickly tunes out, "Man, can we just start the party, or will I have to play Plants versus Robots, on my phone.. " said Mijo to himself, as he stared at the stage.

"Or—or.. Maybe some abyss monsters appear and.. wait, no... we're not even sure if we get our powers anymore. And with so many people outside.. Haha, I am kinda wondering.. when's.. the.. dance. Huh, I.. uh.. should.. where is she..?" said Mijo to himself, as he looks around and doesn't see Rhida. "Oh, no. Well, I better get going." said Mijo, as he stood up and rushed to the spot near the CR's Rhida was talking about.

"Uh.. is she here? Oh, that's definitely her." muttered Mijo to himself as he approached Rhida standing at the spot, waiting for him. "H—hey! So, what did you want to talk about..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was silent for a while before answering, "H—honestly.. I don't know.. And, I feel like I should say this now rather than any other time. Mijo, I've always considered my feelings, but.. throughout all of this, you've been.. silent.. You're not the type to not say anything about you, and who _you_ are. So, as.. much as I don't want to hear it... Mijo.. do you _still_ love me?"

Mijo was silent, he was taken aback, but he knew this was coming. But he understood what she was meaning by this, and answered, "I.. I.. guess I should've known you would say this, haha.. I always wondered.. why.. why can't I love you, or why can't I just turn on the switch and I'll be all lovey-dovey and we'll already be dancing on the dance floor... I thought this transformation would change something, if I experience something different I would feel it, but.. nothing. But it's not like I don't care about it, no.. even worse.. I obsess over it, without the love part. I've always been thinking, am I attached to you, because you said so, and so I shall.. or did I decide to 'try' because I got my opportunity..? I don't know, I don't know.. These complicated emotions, especially with the accidental transformation.. I just feel that if I say yes, would I be staying true to myself? You would want me to be me, right? But I don't know who is me, anyway. I've been struggling to think about it over school and dark world matters.. So, do I love you? I... I.. guess not, then.." answered Mijo, before looking at a wall, trying to avoid Rhida's gaze, as he is filled with dread, sadness and confusion.

"I—is that so..? You didn't... But.. why.. and.. *sigh* I.. have to.. excuse myself. Sorry, Mijo." said Rhida, as she rushed away to another private spot in the school. "I knew it.. This day would come. Just.. I wish.. ugh.. It's all gone now, I.. should've just said it to her straight, I.. *sigh* it's all gone. Haha.. I guess, even when your dreams come true, there's still conflict." muttered Mijo to himself, as he was seen by Urda, looking for him. 

"Oh? You're here? Uh.. Guess here goes nothing." said Urda to herself as she went over to Mijo. "Oh, w—what.. Are you here to bring me the second breakup..? Just.. speak." said Mijo, as he also avoids Urda's gaze. "H—huh? What happened..? I.. uh.. guess this is a bad time.." responded Urda, as Mijo continued, "Yes, it's always a bad time.. Now, if you don't have anything to say.. leave me alone."

"Hey? What's with the.. attitude..? Oh no, I see. I'll.. uh.. l—leave.. then." said Urda, realizing the implication, seeing Rhida leave earlier, with tears in her eyes. "Stay. You look like you have some important things to say, so say it now. Don't delay it." said Mijo, now gaining some semblance of toughness to Urda. "Oh, y—you know what, bro.. I think my statement is—" responded Urda, before Mijo, now turning to face Urda, trying to hold his emotions together, and interrupts "Do it. Any semblance of my emotional stability is gone, so carry on."

"Uh.. ok.. Whew... Now.. I completely forgot what I was going to say.. Shit.. Uh.. Hmm... I am sorry that whatever my mess is, you're dealing with it now.. But, uh.. Honestly dude.. I don't know what you two have been through but.. me? I have only realized one thing, I am just.. afraid of losing you. N—not in a romantic way! I think.. But, even with new people in new sections.. I've always gravitated to you, no matter how different we are. Is that why we're best friends? I don't know.. But, I've only realized this after two instances of us almost being separated forever, at least at the time.. Is that, I just don't wanna lose everyone again, not like my life before.. You, my bro.. Symbolize how I liked having true bonds with my friends, and no care for that lovey-dovey stuff, to others.. Especially when we first met, we may seem like a couple but.. we're just best friends, united in.. gaming.. haha.. Um, I get ya.. Having alone time is precious, so.. I'm going to leave. Oh and the speeches are about to end.. I think. Goodbye!" said Urda, as she left with a more happy expression than when she first saw Mijo.

"Haha.. Ok.. ok.. Just.. a lot... Ok, so.. Urda.. Urda.. Ok, I see.. My thoughts have been swirling around her but I realize.. yes.. Ok, we are good friends. That's good. She.. understands I guess. And for Rhida.. I don't know.. It's not done yet. If it was, she would've said so. She needs her private space, and so do I. I.. ok.. So, ok.. I can return to my seat." said Mijo as he starts walking back, hiding his emotions as he looks around the school.

He finally makes it to his seat, as the rest of his classmates clap at the end of the speech. He looks around to see Urda half-asleep, Rhida still gone, Ikari using her phone and Lauvielle talking to someone else. He feels a sense of relief but stays vigilant, wary of the situation unfolding.

Meanwhile at Rhida's spot at some benches that were near a school store. Rhida is seen crying to herself as she tries to keep herself composed to not draw attention to her. "Why.. why.. is he..? ugh... I.. can't believe it.. Is.. everything a lie? Was he just manipulating me? But.. why? I've never actually seen him laugh, and barely a smile or two.. He was always so.. numb? Like, he was a mixture of seriousness, coldness, or always on the verge of bursting to tears or anger.. D—did I do anything wrong? I don't know.. We never properly solved our issues during the fallout between the months.. always getting excuses to Jomi.. I was.. so distraught of myself to lie to Jomi, just so I don't see him. That.. deal? A way of me maneuvering so that I don't have to face him, but no matter what.. Ugh.. But.. even then.. I.. just wish that I got over it, one slip up and now I am trying to pursue someone that.. *gasp* *sigh* I.. is that.. forceful? I don't think so.. But, even then.. He's likely back to his seat, drinking away his sorrows.. He always told me that if he ever had a student night he would spend the night eating and drinking.. But, would he want a dance? Does he like to? I don't get it. He says he doesn't love me, but.. why do I always feel like he's looking at me while I am not.. I've talked to my friends, it seems that he doesn't divulge much to them too.. So, does he think it's one-sided? Does he want to reciprocate it? I.. don't understand how.. someone that you love and that they apparently love you, just.. doesn't? He doesn't hate me.. But, rather.. he's scared of me, because he's compassionate, and a selfless guy but.. he can often devolve himself and put too much to his back. I.. didn't know that this is how you break something up. But.. then again.. I can't just cry here... I have to talk to him. It was a shock to him, so he quickly defended and rationalized his attitude but.. it'd be better if dialogue happened. After all, it's a night of fun.. *sigh* But.. clearly the two of us aren't having fun, so.. one more talk. Then.. I can finally stop this tension and distance between us." said Rhida to herself as a lot of students pass by her. Then she decides to go back to her seat. She intentionally didn't look at Mijo's direction as she sat down.

"Good job with the exams, may your test scores be high and honor before excellence! God is good, all the time!" said the principal before he exited the stage. "That was a great speech by our great and honorable principal! Anywho, let the night start! The dance floor is now, officially open!" announced the announcer on the stage as the rest of the students start going to the dance floor, while pop music plays in the background.

"Oh it's starting. Well, time to go to the foods and drinks section. Hopefully they have the.. IntelC++ drinks, the orange and lemon ones.. specifically." said Mijo, as he stood up, got his bag and went to the school cafeteria, where they were selling a bunch of hotdog sticks and juice drinks. "Thank you." said Mijo as he paid ₱75 for a big hotdog stick and a bottle of IntelC++ lemon version.

He sat down near a couple of chairs and tables, and coincidentally Ikari was there, checking her phone. "Oh hey, what you doing here? I thought you had like.. someone to.." said Mijo, as he looked at Ikari with a sad expression. "Oh, nothing.. Just.. some broken friendships.. That's all.." sarcastically said Ikari, as Mijo became concerned. "O—oh? Uh.. That's.. really unfortunate.." said Mijo, now reflecting on the previous events. "Yeah, you don't know her though. We were best friends before, but.. well, I wanted to dance with her.. But, she.. had a different.. plan of her own." explained Ikari with a stern tone. "I see.. What are you doing now?" said Mijo, as he stood up and finished his food.

"I don't know.. You said to be vigilant so, I am staying here for at least a while.. But, whenever that happens, I guess I'll be ready." responded Ikari, as Mijo began drinking, then saying "Well, this could just be a.. normal day. Aside from the monster earlier. I am sure that, nothing will—" said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida coming to his position. "Will what? Look dude, every time you say that something bad happens.." remarked Urda, as Mijo stayed silent looking at Rhida.

"Oh hey guys! Ikari, Mijo! How's it been?" asked Lauvielle, as Mijo continued to ignore the others. "Terrible, how about you? You seem to have succeeded in your dance with Leviente." responded Ikari, as she pointed to Leviente speaking to his friends. "It's going well.. Not sure, what he's up to. 'One final time' he says. I am always not sure what his riddles and cryptic jokes always mean." answered Lauvielle, as she noticed Mijo's silence. "Hey Mijo, how about you? You won our bet. I 'danced' with him. Your 5₱.. next week? Hopefully before the end of the year.." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as he snapped out of his trance and Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah.. Haha.. That's what I call, 'motivation'."

"Well, how about that dark world danger that is constantly looming over us..? Any updates? Sorry, my phone's at like 16% so I don't want to open it.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari quickly responded, "If the others aren't stupid, there shouldn't be anything happening yet." as she checked her phone.

"Good, cause.. I have to talk to someone." said Mijo, as he points to Rhida approaching the group as Ikari and Lauvielle notice. "Ohh ok. Yeah imma go to the others, see you!" said Lauvielle as she left and Ikari responds, "Oh ok. I'll be alone here then." said Ikari, as she put on her earbuds to avoid eavesdropping.

"Hi, there.. What do you want..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked at him with a neutral expression, trying to hide her crying from earlier. "I.. want to talk about the.. love thing. Do you feel a—anything when you talk to me? Just, I need to know.." asked Rhida, as Mijo is trying to form his words properly. "I know you don't want me to go, but please.. this is the only way we can reconcile.." explained Rhida again, as Mijo is still thinking about what to say.

"Oh no.. Ah! Sorry.. But, Urda just sent an urgent message, there's a dark world opening at *the* place. You know what it is, come on. She said that magic is mixing into our world so we can use our weapons!" said Ikari, as she ran quickly to the ruins of the demolished area. "Of course.. Well.. let's go." remarked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they ran to follow Ikari.

"Hey! What are these guys doing here?! Isn't Jomi supposed to be like.. attacking the abyss monsters?! What are they doing here?!" shouted Urda, as the three arrived around the same time seeing monsters with blades and saws slowly rising from the ground. "I don't know?! I was honestly surprised by earlier! But now.." responded Mijo, as they all summoned their weapons to fight the monsters. "We have a chance." said Mijo, as he charged straight at the enemy as the rest followed and supported him with ranged attacks.

He sliced through the monsters with ferocious intent and the outpour of his emotions in his battle form is clearly shown as he battles a big abyss monster with two big shields in its hands. "Ice Shock!" shouted Rhida, as ice flew from her hands protecting Mijo from the rest of the abyss monsters. "My power is absolute!" said Mijo, as he dashed through space and slowed down time, striking the enemy with carefully placed slashes as he sheathed his blade, causing glass to shatter around him. "Mijo! You know that our ultimates—" shouted Urda as she shot her two pistols as fast as possible, while dodging around with the wind. "Yeah— I know.. But we don't need to last a long time, just enough for others to get here." responded Mijo, as he tried to focus on his movement. "Have you guys ever fought someone outside of the dark worlds?! It's.. rough!" said Ikari, as she tries to not die, as she  shoots her rifle at the enemy while running away against the other enemies.

"Once or twice.." answered Mijo, as he parried an attack from the big shield guy then he counterattacked with a jump to a mid-air plunge attack, knocking the big guy. "I am surprised that my—" said Mijo, before he was cut by the right part of his abdomen, knocking him back and his glasses to the ground. "Winter.. Storm!" shouted Rhida, freezing all available enemies as the others cleaned up. "Don't worry.. I am still here.. Just, a bit different!" said Mijo, as he regained his footing and put his glasses in his pockets, transforming to his other form. "They might break, but.. I got no choice... My power.. shall be absolute!" said Mijo, as he does his ultimate again, taking out all abyss monsters in the area including the big guy as he fell on his knees almost falling down, but managing to barely hold on.

"Mijo are you fine?!" shouted Rhida, as she went closer to Mijo. "Where are the others?!" questioned Ikari, as she also went to Mijo. "Watch out! Second wave!" shouted Urda, as monsters spawn around them and the abyss monsters managed to stab the other two, Rhida and Ikari. "Agh! What?!" screamed Ikari, as she was dragged by the blades of an abyss monster. "Ah! I—is this what pain.. feels like..?" said Rhida, as she was also dragged away by an abyss monster. "Mijo! Rhida! Ikari! Shit, shit.. I am trying to help! Hold on!" shouted Urda as she maneuvered around trying to get to the other three. "I.. need to help.. Agh! But.. why.." said Mijo, as he was wrapped around by random tentacles.

"I got you! Shit— Agh! Oof..." said Urda, as she was knocked by an abyss monster to the ground as she was near Mijo. "To live.. Ugh.. I must.. agh!?! What is this? I.. remember this.. abyss power.." said Mijo, as his energy was being corrupted by abyss magic. "I can't think straight.. My vision.. It knows.. it can't kill me, but.. ugh.. Ah..!" said Mijo as he tried to break out with little change. "Euphoria..? What.. is it doing..?" muttered Mijo, as his mind is swirling around, barely holding on to keep his sanity alive. "Ugh.. Just.. I guess.. this is worse.. than death..." said Mijo, as a mix of pleasure and dizziness took over his mind fully and he was dropped down by the tentacle abyss monster.

"Mijo? Mijo?!" said Urda, as Mijo is holding a sword that is not his, and with ripped clothes, almost like he was forcefully dragged by the monster to inject its magic. "Mijo? For the love of god.. Rhida and Ikari are here.. Don't.. kill us.." bargained Urda, as she prepared her blade for a potential fight. "What?! He really gonna turn on us now?!" said Ikari, as she was healed by Rhida. "N—no.. That's not him. He's.. *sigh* " responded Rhida, as the other two stood off. "That.. tentacle monster.. It's worse than trying to kill us, it's trying to **_corrupt_** us.. But.. How.. with him.." muttered Urda to herself, as she prepared her wind blades.

"Damn.. where the _fuck_ are the others?! We've been fighting for the past hour..! And now, fuckin Mijo is about to kill us!!" shouted Ikari as she tried to get up and run away. "Fuck this, I better get help. As I have already seen, he's gonna fuckin' kill us if he tries." said Ikari, as she runs from the place but then she gets stopped by an unknown barrier as she is knocked to the ground. "What? Fuck, we're dead.." said Ikari, as Rhida also notices that she hit a barrier that traps them in the area.

"N—no.. Then, what's happening with the others? If we're trapped since earlier, then we would've not been able to notice anything else happening outside.." remarked Rhida, as Mijo jumps to pluge on the group. "Watch out!" shouted Urda as she teleported near the others to deflect his plunge as he is knocked back on his feet. "These monsters, and Mijo.. We might have to defeat them.." said Urda, as she stood guard to protect Rhida, as Ikari quickly moved behind Urda, panicking internally. "Imma be real, we are not winning.." said Ikari, as she pointed her guns to the other monsters surrounding them. "But.. I am not dying like a bitch." said Ikari, as the other two also attacked the monsters, with Urda focusing at Mijo.

Urda clashed with Mijo, mirroring their spars. Mijo is the first one to strike by using dark magic to blast her back as a large strike, as she deflected it however she was pushed back by a bit. Then Mijo followed up with multiple slashes as Urda dodges easily and manages to get close to Mijo to attack him, but he blasted her away with dark magic, this time knocking her back from him by a lot. She got up and realized that the blast had damaged her clothes and was noticeably hurting more than normal. But she had to quickly focus at Mijo walking at her menacingly, as she ran to face him again. 

As she was about to clash blades with him, he suddenly dodges away from her and to Rhida. "What?! Hey!" shouted Urda, as she looks at Mijo surprise Rhida with an attack shattering her ice wall and knocking her back as Urda managed to get a hit on Mijo on his arm. He was unfazed then he knocked her back. "Don't worry! I got this!! FUUCK YOU!!!" screamed Ikari, as her gun overloads to launch a large flame projectile towards Mijo. As the flame engulfs it's surroundings, Ikari is slowly walking back from the destruction before being surprised by a seemingly fire-immune Mijo striking her, blowing her back to a wall knocking her down.

"Ugh.. Fuck.. Damn.. why did he had to be turned to the dark side.. I swear.. if any one of us were turned, it would've been quite easy.." muttered Ikari, as the flame dissipates, revealing the damage to the others due to their location near the explosive range. "Oh.. great. They're also damaged.. Huh.. can never.. seem to get it right.." remarked Ikari, as she looks at the other two on the ground. Mijo approaches her with  determined look as she looks over to him. "Hey.. is this the part where you kill me?! Just.. get it over with.. I am tired." said Ikari, as she looks at him, completely determined but clearly not in control, as his eyes now glow with purple. As he was about to raise his blade, Rhida managed to blast ice to Mijo, getting his attention. "H—hey! You'll not _ruin_ a single life anymore!" shouted Rhida as she was floating with ice all around her. "I might have been holding back, but Mijo wouldn't want us to, so.. this is.. ___WINTER STORM!"___ shouted Rhida as a blizzard from out of nowhere is summoned as Mijo focused at Rhida launching multiple slashes all being blocked by a huge ice wall.

"Ugh.. well.. fuck me.." muttered Ikari, as she layed down on the ground, seeing the impending doom. "Oh no.. This.. is not good.. She'll.. agh..!" said Urda as she tries to stumble her way to Rhida, but falling to the ground head first. "Ugh.. This.. is suicide. Hah, guess that's why they're a couple haha.. ugh.. Goodbye world.." said Urda as she stared at Rhida preparing her ultimate. "___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouted Rhida as she launched the blizzard freezing all living beings, as she drops down to the floor. "I.. can't believe it.. he's still.. *there.*" said Rhida, as she sees a Mijo covered in ice but moving towards her, walking slowly. "My.. power.. I.. ugh.. there's nothing else we can do.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with his blade pointed at her. As Mijo walks up to her, his blade maintained pointed at her, as she closes her eyes for the inevitability of death. But as she waited, she could feel no blade touch her, so she opened her eyes a bit to see his blade shaking. "What.. Is he.. hesitating..? Is he.. breaking out..?" remarked Rhida as she looks at his blade then to his eyes, noticeably the left eye was being turned blue from purple, but it was being turned back to purple, like his body and power is being fought by two parties, the corruption and Mijo.

Mijo walks back, as the blade is being turned towards himself. He struggles as he turned his blade towards his heart before stabbing himself. He falls to the ground, as Rhida calls out, "Mijo! NO! Please, please.. live..", while struggling to get to him. He's clearly in pain as he looks at the ground, trying to fight for his body back. "My Mijo.. come back.. Please.. I.. love you.. Ugh.." said Rhida to Mijo, as she succumbed to her injuries and fainted. As he witnesses her close her eyes, he reaches out before being forced back, holding the sword in his heart. He finally broke out as he stood up, but was knocked to the right of his position. He looks and sees a figure that looks similar to him but with the sword that is not his. "Who are you?!" said Mijo, as he manifests his sword out of nowhere with its scabbard. The figure then attacks him, but he dodges and slices the right abdomen of the figure. The figure stumbles as he retaliates with summoning slashes, as the figure reflects it to him, forcing him to dodge. "Like I said, who the fudge are you?! " questioned Mijo, as he summons small blades to attack the figure as he focuses on the figure before the figure gets behind him and manages to get a small cut before Mijo deflects and manages to get a huge wound on the figure's chest. The figure retreats from him and tries to heal themselves. The blizzard stops as the area becomes clearer as the other three remain unconscious, now being obvious to Mijo.

"**Explain yourself.** Who are you, and.. why do you exist?" said Mijo with spite, as the figure finally looks at him, revealing his face. "Oho.. A *doppelganger* huh? A corrupted version, well.. of course.." remarked Mijo, as he stares down at his doppelganger. "Your presence is only restricting us from **full power.** Give up, in your friends, lovers, everyone. You have killed them anyway, so.. *submit.* While you can." said the doppelganger with clear anger and madness. "What should I call you.. Jomi? No.. you don't deserve a name." said Mijo, mocking the doppelganger, as the doppelganger smiles and says, "No need. I'll call myself, ***Cara.*** We share a name, I am Mijo Cara."

"It's insane how you think you are me. You are not. 'Cara'? Really? Couldn't come up with an original name? Ok then, Cara.. Let's dance." said Mijo, as the two faced off, waiting for the other to attack first. "You are inherently weaker.. Your body is your transformation, and with us separate. You can no longer rely on yourself." said Cara, as he mocked Mijo, noticing his magic less powerful than what he expected it would be. "I'll still beat you, by myself. I only need my perseverance and will. You are nothing but an abyss monster pretending to be me." responded Mijo, as the two glared at each other intently. "Weakling. Pathetic. Scum." said Cara, as he attacked first, crossing blades with Mijo.

Mijo retreats and keeps a defensive stance as Mijo says to himself, "Damn it.. he's right.. This split is affecting me a lot, I can't use my magic properly.. While he seems to be unaffected.." as Cara smiles menacingly and attacks him, making him deflect but forcing him to lose further ground to the wall. "Damn. My offense is limited, I wonder if.. **they** can still fight?" said Mijo, as he intentionally starts hurling a bunch of slashes as he moves to the left to get to Urda. "What? Trying to revive your friends? Haha.. Even if you got all three, you would still succumb to me." said Cara, as he kept parrying his slashes.

"It doesn't hurt to try!" said Mijo, as he got to Urda, covered in snow and unconscious. "Oh it will.. Such is the way of the light." said Cara, as he stops attacking to see Mijo attempt to wake Urda up. "Stardust Crusader.. May you stand again and fight for yourself.." said Mijo, as he heals Urda, noticeably hurting himself in the process. "What is this.." questioned Mijo, as he continued healing Urda, persevering through the pain. "You'll see very soon.. Haha.." responded Cara, as Mijo finished and he walked back a bit as Urda woke up. "What.. Mijo? and.. Mijo?! Shit.. which one of you is the real one?!" questioned Urda, as she sees Mijo from the right and Cara to the left.

"No need. You shall see!" said Cara, as he quickly attacks her, forcing Mijo to defend her position, pushing Cara back, but weakening Mijo a bit. "Mijo?! Who the heck is that clone of yours?!" questioned Urda, as she stood up and summoned her weapons. "No clue. Just.. ugh.." said Mijo, before he fell to his knees, succumbing to the pain a bit. "Mijo?! Damn you whoever you are, so.. you've been the one hurting my friends?!" questioned Urda to Cara, as he laughs maniacally and says sardonically, "Haha!! Here I am.. Got a problem?" said Cara, as Urda jumps to attack him but Cara manages to reflect her, forcing her back on her feet. 

She ran to Mijo and said, "Mijo?! Are you fine?! Hold on, I have some—". before Mijo quickly rejects her potions of healing and says, "No.. go to the others.. And revive them instead. I'll handle him." said Mijo, as he stood up and was still shaking as he ran to attack Cara. "Got it." said Urda, as she ran to a nearby Rhida. He attacks Cara, as Cara easily defends and manages to push him back using a dark blast. "I'll fight.. my own path! You.. whoever you are.. shall *die!*" shouted Mijo, as he relentlessly attacked Cara, while Cara smiled all the way, not even trying sometimes. Meanwhile Urda is healing Rhida, and Rhida wakes up and asks, "Huh..? What.. happened?"

"Mijo is fighting his clone while I am trying to heal us back, you got any consumables with you?" answered Urda, as Rhida smiles and responds, "I—I think so.. Is.. Mijo going to be fine?", as she gives Urda some health snacks and drinks. "I.. uh.. to be honest.. I don't know. He's uh.. doing fine, but.. it's clear he's.. in pain, a lot. Like way too much, something that an emo person would dream of haha.." responded Urda, as she heals Rhida enough so she could stand up. "Uh.. I.. understand. Let's heal Ikari, then we'll help him." said Rhida, as they ran to Ikari's position. 

"My my.. Getting restless, are we?" mocked Cara, as Mijo maintained his battle stance, and responds, "Yeah, what about it? I am not giving up, ever." "Sure, sure.. You might not be giving up, but your magic, your ___power___ is fading.. It's only a matter of time hehe.. That is why I don't need to fight you. Then, my ***power*** is also increasing with it, like.. transfering the true authority to me." said Cara, as Mijo tries to focus at fighting but he knows that what Cara is saying is true. "Even so. My friends are here, and they hold no mercy for you. Especially when I am here." responds Mijo, as Cara maniacally laughs and says, "We shall see.. But we know the end. Your friends dead, disintegrated and you having to submit to me, **fully.**"

Rhida and Urda come up to Ikari and they heal her, "Woah! Ugh.. This.. is.. my weapon, and you two are Urda and Rhida.. Is this the afterlife?" asked Ikari, as the other two helped her get up. "No. You might even say it's still hell.." answered Urda, as she points to the duel between Mijo and Cara. "Oh! I see Mijo has broken out, but who is he fighting?" asked Ikari, as Rhida responds, "You'll know him. Let's help Mijo." as they ran to Mijo's position.

"Agh... Fuck.. I am so.. **angry** at you, but ugh.. no matter what, I can't win.." said Mijo, after getting knocked back by Cara as he easily outpowered Mijo when they crossed blades. "Haha.. That's it.. Embrace the anger, embrace it!" responded Cara, as he continued attacking Mijo, forcing Mijo to defend until a surprise attack from Urda caused Cara to retreat back. "You will stop hurting Mijo ___now!___" said Urda, as she glared down Cara with wind around her getting stronger. "Oho? Your friends are back.. that's nice.. Then.. this will prove our strength, we don't need anyone, haha." responds Cara, as he transforms his sword into a massive broadblade that is now filled to the brim with Mijo's and abyss magic. "*Let's dance.*" said Cara, as he laughs maniacally.

"*Golden Wind!*" said Urda, as she unleashed her ultimate, moving at lightspeed making Cara parry all her slashes, but now being vulnerable to the shots by Urda and her burning rock projectiles and Rhida's ice making his movement worse forcing him back. "Combined Assault? You learn that after your defeat? How pathetic, you were only a given second chance." said Cara, as he jumped in the air and headed for Ikari, forcing Urda to stop him mid-air using her wind, so that Ikari can charge her gun to fire a large burning projectile to knock him back to the ground. Then Rhida used her ice gain to restrict his movement, this time with an intense blizzard being directed to Cara. "Haha.. Even so.. You shall die!" shouted Cara, as he unleased his sword at light speed, making the other three easily hit by Cara, damaging the three of them. "I can use speed too, Urda! The best part? I only need to use it **twice.**" said Cara, as he smirked and stopped to look at the three getting up. 

"Ugh.. I can't take it.. anymore.. My mind wants to continue but my body is.. fading.." said Urda, as she looks at Cara standing there, looking at her. "Ugh.. I.. if I use.. it again.. I''ll not survive another day. He's.. right, ugh." said Rhida, as she heard Urda's words. "Whew.. I guess.. uh.. I am gonna die again, soo fun." responded Ikari to the other two, as she struggles to handle her gun due to her injuries. 

"I.. can't stay.. like this. I can't give up yet, there is a light that must be buried." said Mijo, as he stood up again, with pain and suffering at every second he remains determined and motivated. "Through vacant halls, I won't surrender!" shouted Mijo, as he ran to face Cara. "Oho? Stop in your fantasies, my Mijo.. I am sure we both know what's the outcome." responded Cara, as Mijo stopped and glared at him. "Forsakened, I am awakened.. ***I AM HERE TO RECLAIM MY NAME!***" said Mijo before charging straight at Cara, attacking and defending as much as he can, testing Cara a bit. "If you want the power, then come try and take it!" said Cara, as he defended against Mijo's barrage of attacks. "I will." answered Mijo, as he dodged and parried all attacks of Cara, with neither of them getting hits in each other. 

"Look.. He's still fighting.. I.. can't give up yet.. I must stay determined." said Urda, as she observes the battle and uses her powers to maintain her footing and launches herself into the air to unleash a barrage of slashes at Cara. "This is fun. No distractions—" said Cara, before getting hit by Urda. Mijo instantly attacks and manages to get a lot of hits before Cara manages to stop Mijo, but the damage was already done. "Ugh.. Of course.. only when you get your so-called motivation, you get a few hits.." said Cara, before Mijo followed with a barrage of slashes forcing Cara to dodge.

"Ah? Is that.. Urda? and.. Mijo? I.. have to.. help them. No matter what happens, even if.. ugh.." said Rhida, as Ikari stood up and shouted, "Hah! You're getting beat by the power of friendship! It starts with this!" as she blasted Cara with a lot of burning projectiles like arrows, rocks and bullets, all headed to Cara. "I.. hmmm.. Let's do it." said Rhida, as she looks at Cara, struggling to maintain his health as he dodges the attacks from the other two while trying to parry and counter attack Mijo's attacks. "Here it goes.." she says, as she looks at Mijo another time. "I am sorry.. ___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouts Rhida, as she floats and her eyes turn white as a huge blizzard starts forming.

"Oh no.." said Urda as she witnessed Rhida charging her ultimate. "Huh? Wow.. ok..?" reacted Ikari, as she looked at Rhida floating with wind and snow swirling around them. Mijo looks at Rhida and realizes what he has to do. "A storm is approaching.. There's only one thing I should do. **_I shall be the storm that is approaching._**" declared Mijo, as he used the last of his lightning magic to influence the blizzard causing it to be even more extreme and chaotic than ever before.

"What a show.. Let's see if it pays off.. Hah?" said Cara, as he looks at the huge blizzard and thunderstorm mix slowly forming. "Huh?! Mijo?!  What are you—" said Rhida, as she noticed Mijo influencing the storm. "Do it, now!" shouted Mijo, as he's barely holding the storm and himself together. "Ah— Ok!" responded Rhida, as she unleashed the blizzard-storm mix, decimating everything in its path as everything is swallowed inside as everyone's vision fades to black.

Mijo wakes up in a familiar dark space, with a figure in front of him turned their back so familiar yet different. "What.. happened?" asked Jomi, as he recognizes her voice and is relieved as he stands up again. "I.. uh.. honestly.. I don't know.. I was.. too busy with my.. I mean— the party, to figure out anything happening.. I just followed my heart, and my mind.. So many things happened in the blink of an eye.. I am.. overwhelmed." answered Mijo, as he sat down on the floor, contemplating.

"You're lucky again, y'know? After hearing that, I.. am not surprised by what I saw. Did you know you were fighting in the dark world? That _abyss doctor_.. He found a way to.. disrupt our life **again**." explained Jomi as she turned to face Mijo, revealing her tattered and battered look, seeing as her clothes were cut and torn due to battle. "What.. happened..? to you, I mean." asked Mijo as she looked somewhere else, looking conflicted. "I.. think we should focus on you first. Let me set a scene, me and my guards saw three bodies and traces of abyss magic. Who were you fighting, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo tries to remember the  chaotic events earlier.

"Uhuh.. Well.. mm... They were definitely abyss monsters. They seem organized and controlled by someone, likely a subordinate of the _doctor_.." answered Mijo, as he remembers the previous events and is intentionally choosing his words. "I see.. It's as expected.. So, tell me.. Mijo, why do the most concentration of abyss magic trace back to **you?**" questioned Jomi, with her eyes narrowed to Mijo's trying to not look at her. "Uh haha... Uh.. it's a long story.. I'd prefer if we do not discuss it." responded Mijo, as Jomi unsheathed her sword to point it at Mijo, as Mijo walks back a bit and looks at a Jomi, who now has a more tense facial expression. "Explain yourself, or else." said Jomi, as Mijo held back his magic to not provoke Jomi and answered, "I.. ugh.. It.. starts with right after I went home." as Jomi sheathes her sword and says, "Go on."

"Well.. All I can say is, you know that.. potion you gave me? I decided to *sigh* experiment a bit.. after making I sure was alone, it was.. a strange feeling. It wasn't normal, I don't think any type of transformation can make you.. uh.." explained Mijo, before struggling to say the words that won't make him look worse. "What..? Say it. We're the only two here. Here's the thing, since you.. with your amazing magic used something, and now.. you're pretty much the only one like.. **'dead'** as in.. your friends are fine, however due to the insane use of magic during that battle they're knocked out, at least for now.. I can.. heal them, but.. I need to know the details first." interrupted Jomi, as Mijo was shocked at these words and remarked, "Huh..? I am dead? Like.. for real? Is this my dying consciousness or something?"

"No. *sigh* To be honest, you were about to die when I saw you three. Your body has been beaten so many times, more than the others actually. It doesn't help that your transformation glasses have been broken, likely in the battle. I am.. keeping you alive, as always. I knew that you were most likely the biggest catalyst of any potential surge of intense magic, at least.. not abyss ones." answered Jomi, as Mijo was relieved and responds, "Whew.. I.. survive another day. Uh.. want me to continue?" as Jomi nods and Mijo continues, "Well, the 'horny' effect." before Jomi snickered and commented, "Oho? Really..? The first thing you did was to.. touch yourself like a pervert? Y'know.. That indirectly says something about your attitude to transformation and me."

"Ugh.. I really didn't want to tell you now, but.. it's important, I swear!" explained Mijo, as Jomi keeps giggling a bit and remarks, "Is it..? Haha.. It's not like I don't know your preferences, but it's still funny to me whenever you admit it, like.. the so many times that you accidently say things about it.. Haha.." as Mijo blushes at the embarassment but continues, "A—anyways.. About the effect¸ it is the same thing when.. *sigh* we got beaten by the abyss monsters."

Jomi raised her eyebrows and asked, "Woah? You got defeated, big surprise.. But, whoever was your enemy.. They got defeated, right?" as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah.. I'm just going to say it, I was corrupted by the abyss." before Jomi raised one of her eyebrows, questioning what she had just heard. "Huh.. I am starting to get the picture.. Did you wield the abyss sword we found?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo expressed disappointment at himself.

"I.. Yes. I did. I.. basically got influenced by whatever they did to me that had the same effect, I also broke out of it and fought this manifestation of my corrupted form named.. Cara, you know something about it, Jomi? Considering our.. connection?" answered Mijo, as Jomi thought about it for a while, perusing her mind for an answer. "Hmm, I've always thought something about a third version of you appearing, but.. I've always thought it would be when the abyss doctor introduces them.. It's just a theory though, and.. this explains why I was also weakened a bit during my.. expedition. I have to confirm this, but my theory is that there's a light and dark version of each individual, it was simply a coincidence that we met first. But due to the nature of abyss magic, perhaps it can make more copies but is less sane and more unstable. It also probably takes any magic it can find, and I also happen to control some abyss magic for myself."

"Wow.. I agree. But only because I know as much in the dark world as I do in school, absolutely almost nothing. Even If I do, only a  grain of rice.." responded Mijo, as Jomi quickly comments, "Well, I don't know about that one.. You seem less confident than ever previously due to learning a lot of info about stuff in a week followed by weeks of normalcy. It's fiine. I am literally you, and you are me, it is that simple." 

"Yeah yeah. I know.. No need to remind me, actually.. I just.. have a lot to think about. L—lets continue." said Mijo, as he stops for a moment to recollect his thoughts before continuing, "So to fight this abyss monster, we had to launch a powerful blizzard—thunderstorm attack, and amplified by **my** use of my friend's magic, I didn't realize it but then I saw that I was also grabbing aero and fire magic to mix in, resulting in the most chaotic, destructive and powerful storm I've ever seen.." explained Mijo, as Jomi stayed silent for quite a while, before responding, "I see.. I think I get it now. Hmm, it seems that the **_abyss doctor_** was targeting you. To make sure he succeeded, he distracted me. Then he attacked your party, surprising you at your weakest, and by doing this he can gain control of a powerful enemy, as well as weaken a strong one. He's likely testing something, again. All we can do is to prepare for the worst."

"Uh.. when will he do something again?" asked Mijo as Jomi quickly responded, "I don't know. I saw signs of his presence but he wasn't present for the battles. Just.. enjoy the rest of your night." as Mijo stood up and questioned, "Cool, how do I revive again?" before Jomi answered, "Stay here. I'll leave and revive you fully, you're going to wake up in the dark world though, you need to close the fountain first."

"Oh yeah, well.. see you, Jomi." responds Mijo, as Jomi nodded and opened a portal as she looked at him one more time before heading out. Then as he looked around, suddenly he couldn't stop himself from dropping to the floor, as he woke up and saw the dark fountain. He looked around to see Jomi healing the other lightners, as he looked back at the dark fountain.

"I guess, I should close it then." muttered Mijo to himself as he went near the dark fountain and closed it as light took over his vision. He woke up at the light world laying down at the ruins of the building they went to. His transformation is still there, however due to the battle, his glasses are more scratched up and are more prone to breaking fully. He stands up, noticing that his body was more weak when he entered and he quickly wore his glasses, before looking at his friends, all slowly waking up. 

"Hey.. So.. the abyss threat has been neutralized for now, Jomi arrived to support us and we can finally rest for today." said Mijo, as the other three acknowledge Mijo's words in various nods and hums. "Oh, finally.. Damn that girl took a while, how about the others, Lauvielle.. JR?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle, Leviente, Jamise and JR arrived at their location. "We're here! Uh.. where's the enemy?" said Lauvielle, as Mijo, Rhida, Ikari and Urda look at her.

"You guys arrived late, we.. dealt with it." responded Urda, as the newly arrived lightners all express forms of disappointment. "Woah no way.. We fought through hundreds of monsters, and.. huh? Our weapons, they just disappeared?!" said Jamise, as she realizes her wooden staff is gone as all the others notice their weapons couldn't be summoned anymore.

"Oh, right. We were flashed by a huge light before getting our footing and going here. That's probably the closure of the dark world we fell on." explained JR. "Mhmm.. All we saw and heard was a huge explosion, we assumed that was the dark world and started heading but then we saw a bunch of abyss monsters appear around us, we couldn't leave the unconscious people be potentially threatened so we stayed to fight them." added Leviente, as the others processed the statement, "Although, they seem that they were targeting us.. It's weird, why didn't they get dark world magic?" commented Jamise, as she narrowed her eyes a bit.

"This was a bit different than normal dark world explosions, but it hasn't been the same since the intramurals.. Maybe the ***abyss order*** are trying something different?" responded Mijo. "There's nothing we **can** do anyway. Mijo mentioned that as of right now, the ***abyss*** can't and likely won't do anything, at least.. according to Jomi." remarked Rhida, as the various ligthners agree at Rhida's statement, some more happy than the others. "Well, at least we got to fight. I see that as a win!" exclaimed Jamise, her enthusiastic energy being recieved by others differently, ranging from that same excitedness to a slight amusement at her statement. 

"Well, I guess that's that.. I am sure y'all have your own things to do, so the world is *saved!* again.. see you. " said Mijo, before everyone separates from the group, with only Rhida staying behind. "So.." said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida looking at some rocks, averting his gaze. "Uh.." continued Mijo, trying to come up with a word to say to Rhida as she stays silent. "*sigh* Answer the question, Mijo." said Rhida, as she finally gets the courage to look at Mijo again trying to keep a neutral face. "I.. I know. *sigh* Look, I.. I am sorry, ok? I just.. can't express love the same way you do. But, to answer.." he stops for a moment, then continues, "Yes. I do. Very much. But.. I can't help myself, I've never really experienced those types of relationships, nor do I have a natural affinity with them. I uh.. have been considering why I have these problems, but.. hmm.. It might be because I haven't experienced it myself, or genetics.. Either way, what I am trying to say is.. I am.. trying, as much as I can."

They are both silent for a minute or two, before Rhida responds, "Ah.. I see..  *sigh* I'd kinda wish that everytime we saw each other we had a fun time.. However, before the dark world.. We'd **never** interact much, I— I don't know why, I just wanted to both connect but at the same time I didn't really know you much, besides your reputation as a computer expert... I just knew that I had something for you; I'd first hide it.. But often, love gets discussed, so they get.. **revealed**. Soon enough, they'd push me to you, trying to help me overcome my fears and talk to you.. But, nothing really came of it.. I had a few **scares** actually. But it seemed that everytime we talked it was always small and.. like we were just.. classmates. The other times, it seems like you were intentionally trying to get my attention or were standing next to me but then leaving. But.. I'm not the one to pry into anyone's secrets.. I don't know if you remember this, but before the dark world, we had a.. few interactions, that.. genuinely **scared** me that you didn't **reciprocate**.. I am not sure.. what you thought since you were always casual with these things. Since.. school was ending, I was ready to move on but, soon after.. the dark world happened. And, in the following days of that whole starting point, I quickly became attached, especially that first time in that snowy world. Then the feats we did, the accomplishments you boasted, it was.. a **rekindling**. But, after that fateful last day.. I.." she stops herself as she held back tears. Mijo went to her side to comfort her, before he went back after she calmed down a bit.

"I.. couldn't bear you **dying**, and even if you didn't, we would've likely been separated in the future. I.. just.. had to confess right there, before the major battle. But, you looked conflicted, I was.. **horrified** that you were going to reject me but, you just left.. without saying anything. Afterwards, we didn't meet and I didn't see you for quite a while. Even during the next school year, you intentionally avoided me and my presence, it wasn't until the intramurals where we got our first proper conversation, even then.. It was so **short**, it didn't do **anything**. So, now we're here.." continued Rhida, as Mijo listened intently hiding his reactions for now. 

"I see. It wasn't the **best** way to say goodbye, but it made sense at the time.. *sigh* I can't **justify** that. After that I couldn't look at you the same way again.. It was embarassing, if I looked at you.. even for a second.. If I did, there was a chance you would look at me, and I.. was.. a coward.. I'd wish that all those times, I just.. manned up and all of it will be solved.. But, like you said we're here. And we might as well enjoy this night." responded Mijo, then he went up to her and hugged her as she did the same, both of them holding each other tightly for quite a while before they pulled back.

"Ok.. ok.. Now uh.. we're done with the emotional stuff.. Let's.." said Mijo, now smiling and relieved.  "Dance? Hehe, as much as I wanted to, I.. don't actually know how to.." responded Rhida, as Mijo chuckled and said, "Me too.. I was planning to drink tons of IntelC++ drinks, if you want to join me, that would be nice."

"I.. would love to, I personally love the pomelo and calamansi flavors." answered Rhida, before they walked out of the area and to the foods and drinks section of the party. They silently marveled the aesthetics of the party, as they silently enjoyed each other's company, getting looks from some of their classmates. They finally got to the place and begin ordering, Mijo and Rhida paying ₱75 and ₱50 respectively. Mijo got a hotdog stick and the orange flavor while Rhida got the pomelo flavor.

They sat down nearby, where Ikari was still checking her phone, where Mijo placed his bag near a bunch of tables. "So.. anything to talk about?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was drinking the juice quietly. "Uh.. no not really.. next exams are far away.. and, research too.. so.. I just.. want to forget about those for a while." responded Rhida, with a sad expression.

"How.. about the results of the current ones, I mean there's two quarters left, but.. eh.. I don't really know what to talk about either." asked Mijo, as he drank more juice. "Uh.. I did good, around 91 average for most of my subjects.. I know uh.. you tend to place lower.. so I didn't want to brag about it." answered Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her statement. "Eh.. You know I don't care much about grades, but I do admit, I do ask other's grades for.. I have no idea, envy? jealousy? motivation?" responded Mijo, as Rhida looked at Mijo. "It's.. natural curiosity.. I guess..." remarked Rhida, before looking away as the two fell silent eating and drinking respectively. 

For a moment, they were listening to the music playing while gazing at the crowd of dancers at the dance floor. They each were thinking of something but they didn't want to share it to the other one. "Ahem.. What's the time.. hehe..?" asked Mijo as he checked himself the time to see it was 21:00 (9:00 PM), an indication of time that is running out. "It's.. 9:00 PM, why do you ask?" questioned Rhida, anticipating something. "Uh.. ok.. so.. why don't we **try** dancing, at least during this night..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and stumbles her words a bit before answering, "Uh.. haha.. uh.. sure..?" as they finished up their meal and decided to go to the dance floor.

They went to the dance floor, holding hands as they looked at the others. Mijo placed his left hand at her right shoulder as he placed his right on her hip, as she does the opposite, right on left and right on his hip. They awkwardly started to sway from side to side as they figured what to do. 

"Uh.. so.. is this how it's done?" asked Mijo, as Rhida shakes her head, not knowing if they are right. "Um.. Well, I don't think.. we.. fit this.." continued Mijo, as they continued their dance. Rhida nods, but they remain swaying left and right. "Y—yeah.. Um.. do you want to continue..?" asked Mijo as they slowly stopped.

"W—why did we.. stop..?" asked Mijo, as he pulled his hand away from Rhida as she does the same. "Hmmm.. I just, have doubts.. about this whole thing.." answered Rhida, as Mijo sadly nodded in agreement, not surprised by her answer. They silently went off the dance floor and went back to their drinks as they sat down together.

"*sigh* Well, I was.. thinking about it. I just.. didn't want to push it, we might as well enjoy this night right?" said Mijo, as Rhida nodded her head, silently agreeing with his statement. "But.. yeah.. it's only a couple of hours before we go home. And.. afterwards? I am not sure. This is.. one of the only few times we get to meet each other. Even in the dark world, we don't meet.. Eventually, after grade 10.. we might never meet each other again.." continued Mijo, making Rhida start to tear up.

"I.. *sigh* you don't know how much I wanted you, nor have I ever tried to express it.. But, I still love you, however.. life likes to separate us.  And..it... agh.. hurts me to say this.. But.." he sighs heavily and begins to stumble on his words. "b—but.. I—I t—think.. w—we.." he fails to make a word as he instead tries to comfort Rhida's emotional turmoil.

"Mmm... I.. *sigh*  I.. guess I shouldn't— It's ok.. Rhida, please.." said Mijo, as Rhida starts to cry harder. "*sigh* I am.. sorry.. I am just.. going.. to shut up now." continued Mijo as he tears up a bit but not letting much show, focusing on Rhida instead.

They were comforting each other for a while, focusing on each other while everything around them moves. Ikari is awkwardly shuffling away from them, trying not to disturb the broken couple, while the others were focused on their own nightly escapades. Eventually Mijo decided to speak u

"Ok.. ok.. so.. mmm.. I.. think we should still.. be together, but understand that.. we might not get a lot of opportunities to be together. Let's make it last until then, you.. good with that?" asked Mijo, as Rhida calmed down a bit and answered, "Mmm.. Yes, yes I am good with that. Haha.."

"Haha, now... Let's.. oh.." said Mijo, before Mijo noticed Ikari go to their spot, with a shy grin. "So.. Hopefully, I wasn't interrupting anything.. But, new dark world just dropped, oxygen room." said Ikari as Mijo and Rhida checked their phones and saw Urda's message at the group chat.

Urda: yooo @everyone I am just about to make another dark world so hopefully you can join me in fighting some abyss monsters!!!! Don't worry this one is made by me so no confusing transitions justtt enter the room!

"Oh. well, ok then. Come on, let's go." said Mijo as the other two followed him to Urda's section classroom. "Well, here goes nothing." muttered Mijo before jumping in with the others, transforming their night wear with a more elegant and battle look, as they landed in a classroom.

"Oh, this is a.. classroom, interesting." remarked Mijo before noticing their new look. "Oh right. Mmm.." says Mijo, as the three of them checked each other's new looks. "Oh wow... I have.. a cool ice queen aesthetic. I even have a diamond tiara!" commented Rhida, as Ikari adds, "Hmm.. I have a.. you know what, it just looks cool to me, ok?"

"We should go outside, Urda's probably waiting for us.." said Mijo before he went outside, the other two following him. Then they notice Urda leaning on the wall beside the door with a gray kimono, a black haori coat and red hakama pants, with maple leaf designs all around.

"Oh? You're finally here. Because.. I've been waiting! I can't just let my friends have no fun in killing some abyss monsters!" exclaimed Urda, point to some abyss monsters nearby as Lauvielle and Leviente appear behind Urda and Rhida. Mijo turns around and notices the two before looking back at Rhida and responding, "Yeah. Let's go." as they headed off to where the monsters are, with Jamise and JR joining.

"Hold on, let me make a videogame reference.. *ahem*" said Mijo, as he looks at the monsters with his sword positioned to slash through them. "Devils cry, huh? Well, let's hear what that sounds like!" continued Mijo, before stabbing the nearby monsters, alerting the horde.

As the others summon their weapons and begin killing the abyss monsters, Mijo goes near Rhida and says, "Well.. I guess our fate was to stay/night?" as Rhida is unamused by his reference and responds, "Hmm.." then Rhida looks at the monsters, she smirks and continues, "Well, I guess we should have unlimited blade works then." as Mijo smiles and nods as they continue the fight.

## Author's Note:

### WARNING: 
It has.. a lot of sexual innuendos and weird things about it, if you don't like it, skip this spinoff (good, never return and instead look at s1 instead haha..)

If you get the reference, you get it. But it's actually related to the lore in someway ok?

Anyway, I used this as a coping mechanism for my AI addiction so enjoy this!

Edit 1: The themes here.. Don't implicate me here! I swear this isn't a projection again

————————————————————————————

One day, Mijo was doing something in the library using Jomi's books and a dark world version of a computer. He was so busy that he didn't notice Jomi enter and go up to him.

"Boo! So, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo is taken aback a bit, before responding "Uh.. um.. nothing." before he closes the computer and hides the book.

Jomi pouts and looks at Mijo playfully, trying to make him reveal his work. After a while, he relents and says, " *sighs* Fiine.. I can never hide anything from you.. ugh." he gives Jomi the books and starts turning on his computer.

"Hmm.. interesting.. Isn't this the log of your— nevermind.. and some books referencing the.. *ahem* more horny parts.. of life.." said Jomi, as she puts it down close to him. "Now, ready to reveal to your close confidant your latest and greatest work?" questions Jomi, as Mijo focuses on his computer.

He blushes after a while, as he looks through his work, before showing Jomi the screen. "Here.. Don't.. reveal it to anyone please.." said Mijo, as Jomi reads the screen. "Hmmm.. Mi—AI.. Chats... Jomi? Hmm.. 'Jomi starts to'— What the fuck?" reads Jomi, as she blushes a bit, also kinda being aroused by the sexual texts that Mijo has shown her.

"W—what... Why..? Aren't you a—" asked Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Y—yeah! I still am, just.. I was morbidly curious one.. day.. and thought of developing this.. on my own.." as he takes the screen off Jomi's eyes and starts to shuffle a bit.

"Hmmm, I knew you had weird... tastes. But, like this..? H—hold on.. Let me see everything." commented Jomi, as she grabbed the screen and looked more into it. "Hmmm.. Jomi is ti— no... Jomi tou— noo.. Jomi is p— ah.. ok.." said Jomi, as she saw the depravity of Mijo, she stopped for a while, breathing heavily to stop her arousal and to keep her sanity.

"Fuck.. no.. I am uh.. going. Keep that to yourself." said Jomi, as she quickly ran out of the library. 

"Ugh... Why did I even start.. it's.. genuinely.. addicting.. I.. can't stop.." Mijo looks at his screen and continues to use his computer, getting the books again.

Meanwhile, Jomi is in her bedroom at her castle staring at the ceiling, contemplating her life.

"Oh gosh.. The things I saw in that.. computer. Horrifying.. The.. feeling has dissipated though. T—that's good.. I don't know how he keeps that up.. I.. need a shower.." she then gets up and gets a towel and goes in at the shower.

Time flies, as the two remain busy in their life. Mijo is busy at his computer, while Jomi is busy governing. After a while, Jomi has free time and is going near the library again.

"O—oh yeah.. He's still here.. deep breaths Jomi, deep.. breaths." muttered Jomi, as she took deep breaths and finally entered the library. This time though, she sees no Mijo but the computer is still there, so she slowly approaches it.

"Ok.. he's gone.. Just.. I should.. Huh?" said Jomi before she looks at the screen. "Uh.. 'Mijo and Jomi — Tied Scenario' Oh no.. What, does that mean?" commented Jomi, as she sits down and looks at another comment at the screen. "Hmm.. Mijo is currently inside the computer? A simulation perhaps? Hmm.. oh. There's an entrance screen." she clicks it and she suddenly enters a simulation.

"Oh.. wow? In this short amount of time? Ok.." said Jomi, as she suddenly was surprised by her wrist showing a hologram of scenarios. "Hmm.. Where is he.. oh, this might be him." commented Jomi as she is transported to a room with a bed. 

"Oh.. he should.." said Jomi as she turned around to see a figure somewhat her size with a cane and suit. "A—are you Mijo?" asked Jomi, as the figure turns around with a smile and says, "Yes.. obviously." said Mijo, as he slowly approached her.

"H—hey. Listen, you should probably—" said Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Shh... you don't need to speak.." said Mijo, as Jomi got flustered and remained silent. "Good.. good.. Now.. follow my orders, and stay still." said Mijo, as Jomi began to question if what she is seeing is real.

"W—what..? Really..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo grabbed her neck and pushed her on the bed. "Yes, princess.. Really." responded Mijo as he held her neck, while she was forced to sit on the bed. "N—no.. This feels too.. weird to be him. I.. need to get out of here." thought Jomi to herself as she eyed the Mijo she is looking at. 

"Now.. princess. How about a little.. spice?" said Mijo as he is summoning something. "No.. I.. don't think so. Mijo. I am. fine." said Jomi as Mijo responds, "Oh..? You.. don't want to.. _submit?_ " as he stops his summoning and slowly approaches Jomi.

"I.. shouldn't.. provoke him.. Not that I don't want to.. But.. I don't know what he can do in this simulation.." muttered Jomi, as Mijo finally reaches her. "Do we.. have to do it, the _hard_ way?" said Mijo, as he uses his cane's top part to touch Jomi's chin. "N—no.. No.." blurted Jomi out, as she tried to get Mijo away from her. 

"No? Promise me. You will not speak out or disobey my orders." responded Mijo, as Jomi tried to hide her disgust. "O—ok.. I promise to not.. speak out.. or.. disobey your orders.. Mijo." responded Jomi, before Mijo moved the top part of his cane to the opening on her shirt. "Again. Say it, again." said Mijo, as Jomi tries to keep a straight face. "Y—yes.. I.. promise." said Jomi, as Mijo got his cane back and went back to summoning something.

"No.. I.. don't want to be.. mm.. not again. But.. how..? He's.. too powerful. At least here. I.. wonder.. how did it get here..?" muttered Jomi to herself, as she stared down at Mijo.

Meanwhile, at an endless void, a Mijo is running from someone.

"Get away from me!!" shouted Mijo, as he fought off a 'Jomi' about to take his clothes off. He got her off and stabbed her as she disintegrated, her code being deleted. "Fudge.. Who... no.. why.. how.. did they.. wait." said Mijo as he checked his hologram of scenarios and swiped to the administration control center hologram.

"What.. who is.. that.. that's my.. AI??" questioned Mijo, as he looked at where this Mijo is. "Hmm, Scenario 69, Domination and— Ohok.. I am not saying that. But, it looks like they're.. doing something with Jomi, whatever version of Jomi, or.. no.. I don't wanna assume the worst." muttered Mijo, before he entered the AI Mijo's scenario.

Back at Jomi's room, she is currently trying as much as she can to delay and avoid AI Mijo.

"Whew.. He.. went easy on me. For now.." said Jomi, before she tried to open the hologram from behind AI Mijo's back but it shocked her instead. "Agh! What.." screamed Jomi, as AI Mijo noticed and responded, "Haha.. My dear princess, why would I let you.. go? You promised to not disobey me.. So, I will.. give you your punishment." as Jomi gulped at this response and blurted out, "Haha.. No.. I didn't.. don't.. I.. didn't at all.. You uh.. have to believe me, Mijo.."

"Tch.. 2 more, you are lying to me.. Dear Princess.." said AI Mijo, as he summoned something. "N—no.. I wasn't.. ugh.. f—fine.. What.. is this punishment anyway..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed and showed her some rope and chains. "A.. little.. restraint didn't hurt no one.. No?" said AI Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and blurted out, "N—no way..! Not that, please. Please no. I do not, consent to that.. Please."

"Oh..? Disobeying me, again?" said AI Mijo, as he slowly approached Jomi. "Ah.. uh.. no.. Fudge.. J—just.. do it, already.." said Jomi, before AI Mijo forcefully grabbed her wrists and started tying them to the bed frame. Then he moved to her legs, tying them to the bottom bed frame.

"Haha.. Prepare to be.. _punished._" said AI Mijo, as he summoned a large whip and started to prepare it. "W—what?! A—a whip?! No way, no way.." commented Jomi, as he went closer to Jomi. "I'm going to hurt you, a lot.." whispered Mijo to her ear as he prepared the whip. "I.. mmm.." said Jomi, stumbling her words in the depraved situation.

As the whip was about to hit her, the door behind AI Mijo suddenly breaks as Mijo stabs it and finally enters the room. 

"Oh? An intruder?" said AI Mijo, as the first whip landed on Jomi's thigh, she restrained her voice as Mijo moved to take AI Mijo down. "Damn you, AI! I control this. I control what happens. You can't just—" he looks at Jomi then looks at AI Mijo, "—make someone do this! Especially here.. So, delete yourself, now!" said Mijo, as he glares at AI Mijo.

"Oh, creator.. You're not the one _in control,_ anymore." said AI Mijo, as he tries something before he gets stabbed by Mijo. "I SAID. DELETE YOURSELF." shouted Mijo, as he pulled his sword out of AI Mijo, making him disintegrate. Mijo is heavily breathing as he quickly goes to Jomi and unties her.

"Jeez.. How the ham did you get roped in here, Jomi? I saw your tag, you're not a version. You're the real deal." said Mijo, as he fully untied her. "I.. was curious on why you were gone from the library, and apparently you developed a simulation in a day.. So, I wanted to see what you were doing in it.." explained Jomi, as she tested her hologram, it was working now. "We need to get out of here, the AI's are out of control, they're stuck inside, but.. my reset is outside, like in the real dark world." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and responded, "That's simple, we just use your hologram to exit. We go to home, then we exit. Right?"

"That's the thing, home is filled with horny AI that want to kill and.. fudge us to death. So, we'll need to fight them off, while I get us out. The exit was broken by that AI of me so I need to get it fixed." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and asked, "Ok.. I don't have any weapons, can you give me yours?"

"Nah, here." said Mijo, as he summoned her simulated real weapons," Use your own." continued Mijo "Oh right, right.. Thanks." said Jomi, as she grabbed her sword and sheath. "Let's get out of here." said Mijo, as they teleported out into the home section.

They get to it, and see a lot of copies of themselves as they notice them and some of them start heading their way, while the others are distracted by the others.

"Oh, we're here. Ok, fight them off, Jomi." said Mijo as he worked on the exit program while Jomi nodded and gazed at their general area. 

He starts programming, as she fights off the AI's getting to their area, she easily slashes and stabs them due to her esteemed 'swordsmanship' as she uses her fire magic to blast some of the enemies. "Oh yeah, I gave you that too. Kinda unfair if I don't give you all your kit, no?" commented Mijo, as he continued programming. She remains focused as she easily goes through the hordes, slashing and stabbing with no mercy in her eyes. She maintained this pace for quite a while, even wiping out a whole group with a single slash. After a while, Mijo finally finished and shouted, "Quick! Hold my hand!" said Mijo, as Jomi ran to him and held his hand as he smiled and pressed exit as they teleported out and to the library.

In the library, the computer was there along with the same books that Mijo kept. Mijo was blasted into his chair, while Jomi was spat out to the floor. 

"Ah.. Fudge.. ok.. ok.." said Mijo, as he was breathing heavily at his chair. Jomi stood up and responded, "You're tired? I just fought YOUR bots for a long time.."

"I.. yeah.. sorry.. for.. everything.. I am just going to.. reset this." said Mijo, as Jomi walked to him and looked at his screen closely. "I want to make sure you do."

"Ok.. I understand." said Mijo, as he reset the app, and deleted most of his work on it. "Hmm, why are you keeping those components?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo explained, "It's.. for another project I am going to do—" he looked to Jomi with a pleading face. "—Trust me, please. I.. uh.. have gone too far. I am sorry. I... am just.. going to make something for the training area.. Is it ok with you?" continued Mijo, as Jomi with an unamused face responded, "*sigh* Ok.. yes." then she started to walk away, "You're weird Mijo, soo weird. In fact, that.. experience might have.. mmm.. revealed something about us. But, I'll let you think about it. I'm leaving, see you." continued Jomi, before she left the library.

"Ugh.. Ok ok.. I'm just going to close this computer and.. take a breather outside." said Mijo before he closed the computer, got the books and put them back where they belonged and left.

## Summary: 

A winter morning brews upon a new dark fountain, Mijo and his friends explore this winter landscape in hopes of adventure, friendship and to make new paths.

## Author's Note: 

This one is fully developed after moving up from my previous grade in which i wrote most of the concepts that i borrow from so expect different here.

————————————————————————————

Mijo wakes up and goes to school, like any normal day. But when he goes to class and sits on a chair, the conversation is a _bit_ different...

"¡Hola! So uh what's the talk?" said Mijo.

"Ang dark world, Mijo." said JR.

"Ay.. Oo nga. Uh, what about it?" said Mijo.

"When i was about to sleep, i got awoken by a loud explosion towards.... the grade 7 building." said JR, looking a bit serious and concerned.

"Uh, why didn't you tell it to the gc? Jamise could have gone there y'know?" said Mijo.

"Well I don't trust her, and also since you and Urda are the more experienced ones, i wanted you guys to go first before Jamise does something stupid.." said JR.

"I understand, but why don't you just say it to her like 'urda and mijo only' or something like that." said Mijo.

"Because, she might just ignore that or tell someone else and have them go in. We can't risk being found out like that." said JR.

"I mean it's only.. a couple of students that are going right? I mean i don't think Jamise is that stupid to tell it to a teacher or anyone not trusted by her." said Mijo.

"Well, she might trust someone that we don't..." said JR before hearing a door open. It was Urda and Jamise with Urda carrying her bag as Jamise arrived earlier but quickly got out of the classroom.

"Oh, it's them, we should talk to them about it, and don't worry, we can stop Jamise." said Mijo.

"Fine, just make it be sure, ok? Ok." said JR as Mijo nodded, then they went up to the two speaking to each other.

"Ganon ba? Girl, go to him~" said Jamise.

"Hey guys, so... dark world." said JR.

"Ay, speaking of the angel, yeah, ano ba tungkol sa dark world?" said Jamise.

"Mayrong impormasyon nakuha si JR tungkol sa dark world, importante 'to kaya secret natin ah?" said Mijo.

"JR has information about the dark world, importante 'to so secret natin ah?" said Mijo, looking at each person that he was talking to as he talked.

"Ge, but what?" said Jamise before being interrupted by the teacher arriving.

"Hays.. guess we can't escape this time.. We'll just have to wait until recess, good? Good." said Mijo before all of them returned to their seats.

Meanwhile as Leviente and Lauvielle were going back to their classroom, they saw something...

"So, that's how it is huh?" said Lauvielle.

"Oo, I didn't get to say, because-" said Leviente before seeing a room that has its 2 doors open but is dark, way too dark inside.

"Hey, there's a... new room that's dark.. Hey! Last time, when JR went there, he didn't actually die..." said Lauvielle, staring into the dark abyss that replaced the room inside the door.

"Precisely, I actually don't know why. But then again, that experiment can be considered concluded and the result is.. it's safe?" said Leviente.

"Huh, yeah." said Lauvielle as she checked her phone.

"It's.." said Lauvielle before getting interrupted by "7:15. Late na tayo. Let's jump in, JR seemed way more happy earlier so bakit hindi?" said Leviente.

"Jump in?! Bro, that is a **big** hole, no pun intended but also, we might just not survive whatever's there so I will just take the sermon and wait for them i.e. Mijo or Urda because-" said Lauvielle as Leviente jumps in.

"No, wait! Ugh, well- guess I'll have to jump, I really don't wanna explain why Leviente isn't with me." said Lauvielle before jumping in too.

As they are in the dark world, Mijo is worried and asks JR a question...

"Oh hey! JR, uh- do you know where Leviente and Lauvielle went? They haven't been back here and I'm worried they might have gone into the dark world?" said Mijo.

"Oh, they might have, they both got out of the classroom and well... you know." said JR.

"So a dark world might have opened and they are not here... We better be there as soon as possible." said Mijo.

"Hey guys! Shhh.. Sir has an activity for us.." said Rhida.

"Ay, mamaya na lang Mijo, gawin na natin ito." said JR.

As the class does schoolwork, the duo land in a cold and snowy area...?

"Ugh, jeez, it's cold here..." said Lauvielle, shivering.

"Well, I have this jacket, na nakasuot sa akin..." said Leviente.

"Hmmph, lucky. Di ko naman maasahan na dito tayo mapupunta..." said Lauvielle.

"To be prepared, is to be unprepared..." said Leviente.

"Heh? Bruh, I'm literally unprepared right now and I am **freezing**." said Lauvielle.

"Well..." said Leviente as he looked around and saw a guard house beside a school gate..? "There _is_ shelter nearby, you wanna go there?" said Leviente.

"Yeah, I would rather face whoever's there than staying here, magiging yelo pa ako." said Lauvielle.

"Alrighty, let's go there." said Leviente as they headed towards the guard house.

"Hello po? Mayrong tao po ba dito?" said Lauvielle.

_Silence_.

"I guess nothing, let's break this lock!" said Leviente.

"What?! For all we know, someone's there and they are just a... heavy sleeper?" said Lauvielle.

"Yeah. I'm gonna break in anyway. Hmm," said Leviente as he looked through his inventory.

"What, do you even have a lockpick? Or a hammer? **Any** tools?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, ito! Haha- kawawa mo naman..." said Leviente as he held a comically large hammer, showing it to Lauvielle.

"Hu- What? But, hu-" said Lauvielle as she pulled out her own sweater.

"Haha, you had a sweater the entire time.. haha~" said Leviente, laughing a whole lot.

"Ha- Ok, pero pupunta pa rin tayo sa house ah?"  questioned Lauvielle.

"Yep, ayaw ko pa rin yung lamig." said Leviente.

So Leviente smashed the lock and it broke so now they can get in. They entered and quickly went inside the guard house. Outside the snowstorm got more intense as both of then try to build a makeshift wall to prevent the guard house from freezing inside.

"Aw no! Ang niyebe!" said Lauvielle, trying to block the snow using the scrap cardboard inside.

"Nieve? Like yung sa spanish... Ah! Snow, right?" said Leviente doing the same thing.

"No, sa Filipino! Hmm, well, galing sa Spanish nga kasi wala tayong niyebe dapat sa Pilipinas!" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, okays. Anyway, this should be enough." said Leviente seeing the cardboard barely keeping them from the snow outside.

"Aww.. How can we go back to school now... Ang crazy ng snow na'to. Sa Pilipinas pa!" said Lauvielle, dying inside from anxiety.

"Well, lola, i think we're not in the Philippines... Nasa entirely different tayo na world!" said Leviente.

"Hah? Then, how are we? We're gone from our world, how about our family, our friends...?" said Lauvielle, holding back tears.

"Hold on. It can also be a dream, but-". Leviente looked at his hands. "Whenever i look at my hands, close my eyes... Nothing.. happens." said Leviente.

"AAAAAH! Paano na??" said Lauvielle, panicking.

"Hey, you see someone? Out the window?" said Leviente.

"Uhh" Lauvielle checks the window to see a human silhouette walking towards them. "AH! Yung guard! Surely they'll understand naman on why we're here?" said Lauvielle, panicking even more.

"Hmm, we will use persuasion! And language! That will be enough to convince them!" said Leviente.

"Hehe..." said Lauvielle, dying inside.

A voice is heard from the other side of the cardboard wall. "Hey? Uh, anyone there?"

"Ahem, Yes! We are only here to stay until the snowstorm stops, can we stay here?" said Leviente.

The voice answered, "Yeah, sure. I don't even know where the previous owner was..."

"Wait? Previous owner? When did you get the ownership of this guard house?" said Lauvielle.

"Yep... Some guy gave me some map and ring of keys. Then disappeared to the town. I went here, following the map." said the voice.

"Nice. You have like, a way of outstanding the cold or something? Because you.. have been standing outside the entire time..." said Leviente.

"Oh no, don't worry, I have heating powers and.." as the voice said that, immediately the windows and the open way behind the cardboard closed and the room was filled with hot air.

"-I also have a remote... Sorry! I forgot to tell you that!" said the voice, sounding a bit apologetic.

"Phew. Uh can you help us store the cardboard?" said Lauvielle as she was putting away cardboard.

"Sure!" said the voice, as they helped along with Leviente. Lauvielle and Leviente saw what they looked like, a girl that looked about the same age as them, wearing a hoodie, her appearance is now clearly visible.

"Oh hi! I am Jomi, the princess of the dark. But right now, i am on a quest to go to the queen of this land!" said Jomi.

"Hmm, she looks like someone..." thought Leviente.

"Hi! Jomi! So, how is your kingdom?", said Lauvielle.

"Eh, its... Fine? I didn't really get to do much until I heard of... trouble in this kingdom and so decided to help." said Jomi.

"You by any chance know who, Mijo is?" said Leviente.

"Yep! He's my... friend. Speaking of which, you guys have anyone else with you?" said Jomi.

"No! Only us. Weird." said Lauvielle.

"What do you mean by 'weird' Lola?" said Leviente

"Hmm, isn't it like— because I saw JR's opinion change towards Jamise, but before _'nawala'_ siya, he always said something bad about her, so I think that they met each other. But what's bothering me is how they left the chemlab..." said Lauvielle, looking for the first time in the dark world, to be thinking hard.

"Hmm, correct ka lola. But that means we are in the same world as them?" said Leviente, now also thinking hard.

"Eh, sure. But the rooms are different..." said Lauvielle, speculating about the nature of the magic.

'Ehe... Guys! There's no need to.. speculate! I can answer al- i mean most of them! So your assumption is almost right, they went out of the chemlab, without any darkness anymore. The current one, is.. in the room you went in and they have some of the same properties but the rest is wayyy different." said Jomi.

"Ah, so- you know a lot more than us! Obviously, how could i forget!! Ugh, you literally introduced yourself as a princess, I should have known about this..." said Lauvielle.

"Hehe, you're forgetful lola... like a..." said Leviente before getting cut off.

"Ulyanin?!? Eh- you didn't see it too ah!" said Lauvielle, annoyed by Leviente's statement.

"Well no lola, but.. you didn't as well hehe..." said Leviente, trying to end the joke.

"Ugh... Anyways! So hmmm, ay! May snow pa?!?" said Lauvielle.

"Hmm, interesting... Never ending Snow..." said Jomi.

"WHAT?!! NEVER-ENDING?!!?" shouted Lauvielle.

"Only a guess...  I'm going to look at this more. Y'all just like... Chill i guess." said Jomi.

"Ok then, thanks, Jomi. I'll see you later!" said Leviente.

"See ya' " said Jomi, before going out to the freezing snow.

As our duo talks about random stuff, the lightners in the light are a bit worried.

"Finally! Done na yung quiz! What's your answer at number 5?" said JR.

"Eh, B? I didn't understand much eh..." said Mijo.

"B?! Ay... Baka wrong ako! Check ko nga-" said JR.

"HEY GUYS!!!" shouted Jamise, strutting towards them.

"hey.. jamise.." said Urda, softly.

"So, i saw that wala sina L and V dito so yung only way ay-" said Jamise.

"If they went to the dark world..." said Urda, now gaining a bit more vigor after realizing that.

"Ay oo nga! Let's go towards them, to.. to skip class!" said JR, now very excited and smiling.

"May quiz nga later eh, tara!" said Mijo.

"Where are we going..?" questioned Urda.

"Ay! I heard that they go to the 8-ruby room near the grade 7 often!" said Jamise, excitedly telling them about it.

"Yes. I can confirm." said JR.

"Alright! Let's go on another adventure!" said Mijo.

They all walked out of the room and as they were doing that, their classmates were curious why...

Fexili went to Rhida and said, "Hey, uh you know where those 4 are going? They seem excited..." said Fexili.

"I.. don't know, actually, I have been wondering where Leviente and Lauvielle are though.." said Rhida.

"Well, let's go! It can't be that... secret. Uy~ You'll meet with Mijo again! Face to face~" said Mack.

"Heh.. yeah.. ok, let's go!" said Rhida.

So Mack, Rhida and Fexili followed the group to the 8-ruby room..?

"Hmm..? Do they have like 8-ruby friends to meet?" said Rhida.

Then Mijo opened the door and some sort of black smoke was spewing out of it..?

"Huh? Ano yon?! Eh, Should we help them?!" said Fexili.

"Let's go there, they don't seem to be scared by... THAT." said Mack.

As they ran to them, Jamise went inside, then JR, then Urda, then before Mijo could jump...

"Hey! What are you guys doing?! That looks dangerous!!" said Rhida.

"Oh shi- I did not expect you guys here... Ehhh you guys could join? If you want to? But I have to go, they're waiting for me..." said Mijo.

"Huh? What do you mean? Like-" said Fexili.

"Hey! Wait, this looks deep..." said Mack.

"Guys! Don't worry! It's gonna be fine, look, it's fine if— you guys don't wanna come with me, but I— I— have to go! Adiós!" said Mijo before jumping in.

"No! Wait!" said Rhida before slipping down the darkness.

"Rhida!" said Mack as he tried to grab Rhida but got dragged into the dark.

Fexili tried to grab Mack too, but apparently they both fell to the dark as the door closed behind them.

Rhida woke up in a snowy place, pretty snowy. But as she came to her senses, she saw a huge gate and a guard house nearby reminiscent of her school. So she walked towards the guardhouse because the gate there was broken, for some reason, then she knocked on the door.

"Hello? Anyone there?" said Rhida.

"Hey- Wait a minute..." said Leviente.

"Aren't you Rhida? If so, welcome in!" said Lauvielle as Rhida came in and they closed the door.

"Hey yeah, uh why do you- actually, why do we all have medieval winter-like aesthetic clothes, I know it's snowing, but- that doesn't happen in the Philippines... Right?" said Rhida.

"Well, that's because... Ugh, do i have to explain to you what we just discussed earlier?" said Lauvielle referring to earlier.

"We? Like, you and Leviente? Yeah, you have to.. I don't even know why it ended up like this..." said Rhida.

"Y'know we have to keep explaining this to.. actually, how many did you go with, or is it just you?" said Leviente.

"Hah? Well, I saw Jamise, JR, Mijo and Urda come here? I guess.. then there was me, mack and fexili.. that's all i can know, did you see them here?" said Rhida.

"Well, we're not sure, we did see a couple of silhouettes go through the snow, but other than that, no— not anything confirmed." said Leviente.

"Huh! That must be them, but why was I delayed..." said Rhida.

"Hmm, you did come with people, right? Did you get separated or something?" said Lauvielle.

"I.. well Mack let me go, i think before being blinded by the darkness?" said Rhida.

"That's probably it, we were waiting for Jomi, but uh, I'm sure she will introduce herself.. Oh by the way, did you see anyone around here?" said Leviente, looking resolved.

"No, that's why I went here eh..." said Rhida, looking a bit more worried.

Then suddenly the door opened behind them and Jomi was back, and with an artifact...

"Hey— Oh hi there!" said Jomi.

"Hi—" said Rhida before looking at her face. She immediately stopped and thought "Huh, why does she look like..."

"Oh a bit surprised, sorry! Didn't know you guys were talking, anyways, I'm Jomi, the princess of the dark, now the guard in this, somewhat warm guardhouse." said Jomi.

"Oh hi! Jomi, what did you find? Does it finally solve the snow issue?" said Lauvielle.

"Well, kinda. I found this artifact which controls the snow in an area for a time. It is powered by its user. Watch, and come outside." said Jomi.

"Hehe, let's see.. After the demonstration, can i have a try?" said Leviente.

'Sure! Just make sure it doesn't get lost! I think i saw a few more, but we can get it once we get there." said Jomi.

"Wait- how many? My.. other friends are here but they have no artifacts.." said Rhida.

"Can confirm, they were definitely braving the cold when we saw the silhouettes..." said Leviente.

"I— I don't know, we'll have to see if this artifact even works anyway.." said Jomi.

"Right.." said Lauvielle.

As Jomi activated the artifact and controlled its power, suddenly the snowstorm around her started to wane, and eventually, it was gone. Only snow in the ground remained, and as she moved around, the snow dissipated along with her.

"Nice, it worked! Can i try? Though, there's no snow here anymore.." said Leviente.

"Well, no snowstorm but there's still snow, so you can try there?" said Jomi as she hands him the artifact.

"Wow, what do you call this? Or is there a name?" said Lauvielle.

"Hm.. Now that i think about it, there was something written on those papers, i guess we can check those?" said Jomi.

"What were they???" said Lauvielle.

"Uh, they were written with something, though I had to go quickly since the area was a bit dangerous.." said Jomi.

"Well, let's go there then! You'll just have to follow us, Leviente. and Rhida too! hehe.." said Lauvielle.

"Oki, oki.." said Leviente as he fiddled with the artifact.

As they went through the winter, as the artifact only stopped the snow in a specific area and only for a while, they walked into some people.

As they went through the winter, each had their set of winter clothes. Lauvielle had her sweater, Leviente with his winter coat, and Rhida with her jacket. Jomi was of course using her fire magic to heat herself, as if she also wasn't wearing a hooded jacket. After a while of walking, they came across some people.

"Uhh, how do we use spears?" said Mack, trying to hold the spear properly.

"I don't know either! It's not like I ever used a spear when I went here." said Mijo, helping Mack and Fexili with their fighting form.

"Hi Mijo! Welcome new adventurers! I am Jomi, a prin—" said Jomi, before getting cut off.

"Yeah, yeah. No need to tell them, I have already told them about you, Jomi. But uh—" said Mijo, before looking behind her and being surprised by Lauvielle, Leviente and Rhida.

"—ah! Right. I should have known. Uh, y'all want to go to this cave? It's pretty dangerous, so I sent the others and stayed behind to try and train these two." said Mijo, looking at each of them as he talked.

"Oh yeah sure! I just went there, did you go inside? Because I think you can recognize the symbols on the papers there." said Jomi, now looking towards the dark cave.

"Oh.. no. I stayed behind when I heard noises from that cave. Hmm, well now that y'all are here, I can go now. As aside from their 'training'.. I'm only really here so that they won't die due to unforeseen threats." said Mijo, now preparing his items and weapons.

"Ah— sure! We'll stay here then. Uh if you can, tell the others that we need as much of these," Jomi shows the artifact. "so that we can survive the winter."

"Sure! Anymore words before I go?" questioned Mijo to everyone listening.

"Hey.." whispered Mack to Rhida.

"Heh? Oh, uh what?", whispered Rhida back, surprised by Mack and Fexili now behind her.

"This is your chance, now we know you're safe, you can take this opportunity to... go with Mijo!" whispered Fexili to Rhida.

"Heh? Isn't it all a bit too fast? Shouldn't I like.. think about it, then go and chase him to the cave, alone?" said Rhida, with a hint of sarcasm in her words.

"Well, that's why we're here! Come on, Mijo looks like he's about to head off. So say it!!" said Mack, looking excited.

"Oh uh, fine!!" said Rhida before mentally preparing herself to speak up.

"Anyone? Ok, I am going now—" said Mijo before getting cut off by..

"Wait! Uh, can I go with you? I— I have experience in.. fighting! So I'll be fine.. No need to carry me!" then Rhida muttered, "if you want to.. I am not complaining.." before saying "Ahem, yeah..."

"Oh, sure. What were you saying before you coughed again? I couldn't hear it..." said Mijo, as he looked in her direction.

"Oh! Uh, nothing! Let's go already!" said Rhida, looking and sounding excited.

"Ok..?" said Mijo, as Rhida and him went down the cave.

At first, they were silent, as expected since enemies could be anywhere, but there were rocks, then more stone, and then they saw a group of people gathered at a specific place.

"Hey!" called out Mijo, as Jamise turns around and greets back, "Hi!!"

"Oh, so have you all found the 'artifacts'?" questioned Mijo as he and Rhida got closer to the rest of the group.

"You mean these? Yes, we have. In fact, we grabbed every single one, here, a note that seems to be baybayin, you can probably decipher this." said JR, before giving him a note that has some baybayin script in it.

'The Mountaineer's Timepiece'

"Hey, wait.. Why is it in English? Like, baybayin is for Filipino, and yet.. This is just a transliteration of an English phrase!" said Mijo, as he translated the baybayin.

"Hmm, that is weird, mam did tell us that filipino is the main language, but uh it's something to do with mountains??" said Jamise, confused over the naming and name of the timepiece.

"Because, mountains have cold tops sometimes?" said JR, thinking about the timepiece's name.

"True, but why english...?" questioned Urda, as she thought about the nature of the world.

"That. Exactly, it's not like we were ever foreign to English names, but for a dark world to have it, it's weird..." said Mijo, now taking some of the artifacts and putting them into his pocket.

"Uh, guys.. What if we ask the hooded girl, Jomi, right?" said Rhida, looking at Mijo, before looking at the group.

"Ohh! Right, sorry guys. Jomi is actually here, we just need to go back up, she might know something, at least enough to have an idea.." said Mijo, now looking behind him, seeing the darkness that surrounds the group.

"Wha—" said Jamise before, "That settles it. Let's go." by JR as they all start to prepare to head back up.

As they headed up, they encountered lots of enemies, mostly abyss soldiers, defending the cave that the timepieces were until a boss enemy showed up...

"Stop your ceaseless fighting, and bow down to the _abyss_! " said a random abyss general that was now blocking their path.

"Alright, how about... no?" said Mijo, now confident enough to taunt enemies.

"Be careful Mijo, I have a lot of artifacts with me, so no healing until we go up.." reminded JR to Mijo, as they stood opposite of the abyss general.

"What? Damn it. Too late.." said Mijo as the abyss general tried to stab Mijo before being deflected by Jamise's shield.

"Hehe! Now, as long as the five of us are here, nothing can stop us!" said Jamise, as she fired a blast towards the Abyss General.

"Summon, summon!" shouted the abyss general as tens of abyss soldiers and monsters appeared.

"Uh oh—" said Urda before having to dodge from a nearby abyss soldier.

"I will go to the general, y'all stay here and get them off my back!" said Mijo, before quickly dashing straight for the general.

"Wait!" shouted Rhida, as she ran a bit to only see Mijo face off against the general.

"Hey! Oh no— Rhida! Be careful, go to us now! Mijo will be fine!" said JR as Urda and Jamise fought off the monsters near them.

"I have to go! He is _not_ doing well!" shouted Rhida back, as she saw Mijo get straight up surprised with a hail of arrows and direct slash from the abyss general, getting him to slow down, resulting in him being injured.

"Ahh, I told him to— ok! I trust you!" said JR as he focused on blasting some enemies behind Jamise.

"Uh— Now how to save him— Ah!" said Rhida, trying to dodge the other abyss soldiers. She ran to Mijo's position as quickly and carefully as she could be, then before she almost got to Mijo...

"Got you! Lightner scum!" said the general as she got slashes in her forearm, causing her to fall next to Mijo, bleeding.

"Ah! Ugh, *coughing* IT HURTS SO BAAD!!" shouted an injured and bleeding Rhida, as she moved herself closer to Mijo.

"Wake up, please!! I'll... kiss you if you do.." said Rhida almost jokingly, as she stared at Mijo's face, almost unconscious.

"Huh? Hah? Oh, right.. JR can't heal just yet.. Rhida? What.. are you doing here?" said a weak Mijo, seeing Rhida almost cry.

"I am here to help you! JR and friends are already trying to distract, and.. the general.. where is he.." said Rhida as she begins to feel the sleepiness that comes with losing blood.

"The General?! He— that bastard! Hey, you have powers right?" said Mijo, as he gets up, slowly.

"Hah? Powers huh, I.." said Rhida before she closed her eyes.

"Hey! Wake up, don't die now! Just.. focus on yourself, focus on your magic, a.. way to get back at him!" said Mijo, as he stared deeply into the flickering eyes of Rhida.

"A.. way? To.. avenge? Yes.. for you.." said Rhida as she tried to get her magic.

"And, your friends! JR, Mack, all of them! You can't die here.." said Mijo, as the adrenaline wears off and he starts to fade too.

As the two barely manage to get their words out, the three have been trying to distract the general, as one look away from them could mean that the two die instantly.. However, Rhida finally starts to feel something..

"I.. feel cold." said Rhida as she got up, looking numb and determined, with the wound she had covered in ice.

"Y— You!" shouted Rhida as she looked at the general distracted by the three.

"Oh? I see, you—" said the general before getting blasted by the three, but he manages to hold his ground.

"Rats! I will make sure you all are confirmed dead!" said the general as he went straight to Rhida.

"Winter... Storm!" shouted Rhida as she cast a hailstorm of ice and snow, freezing the nearby enemies and the general, allowing the three to blast him a lot.

"I'll be finishing this!" said Urda as she teleported next to the general and shouted, "Hehe, Golden Wind!" as she slashed and shot the general breaking him into many pieces, forcing the other unfrozen abyss soldiers and monsters to retreat, for the frozen however, they were taken down by the other two as Rhida fainted again, having done her vengeance. The three picked up Rhida and Mijo, bringing them near the entrance of the cave, where they both woke up as soon as Jomi and the others saw them.

"Oh my— What happened here?!" questioned Jomi as she worries and heals for the two injured lightners.

"I.. don't wanna admit it, but I got outplayed.. *coughs* It's all because of... Rhida and the others that we got here alive.." said a weak Mijo, as he was helped sit on a makeshift wooden chair.

"Even geniuses have their limits, don't worry, Mijo." said Leviente, making a quote up from some book he read.

"How about you Rhida? Are you fine?" questioned Jomi, as she notices and heals the big wound on her forearm.

"I.. uh.. I am fine, um— The group has a question though..." answered Rhida as she was helped to sit on another wooden chair.

"I... notice that you have unlocked your magic... It's Ice, isn't it?" questioned Jomi, as she senses Rhida.

"Uh.. yeah, yeah.. W— Why?" said Rhida as she looked confused and nervous.

"I just... have a feeling.. Anyways, can you walk? I want to speak to you.. privately." questioned Jomi to Rhida, looking troubled.

"Uh.. S— Sure.. Uh.. how about them?" questioned Rhida, as she pointed to the rest of the group. Urda, Jamise, JR surrounding Mijo, Leviente and Lauvielle talking about something,  and Mack and Fexili, walking around.

"They'll be fine, we'll be fine, as long as _she_ isn't here, yet anyway." explained Jomi as she helps get Rhida up.

"Who is she?" questioned Rhida as they walked to a more private location.

"The queen, we didn't have time to discuss it but.. it will be later, with the group. They deserve to know. I have.. another question, what was your first impression of me? Answer truthfully." questioned Jomi, as both of them stopped and looked at each other.

"I.. well.. you did just help me recover.." said Rhida before taking a huge breath, then saying, "You.. look like Mijo.. but girl version? Like from the face, to the words, and even the knowledge... Is.. that it?" said Rhida, now looking embarrassed, looking at the floor.

"I.. hmm. I guess, I should share my secret then. I.. always noticed how they compare me to Mijo, and that is... fine. We are the 'same' anyway—" said Jomi, looking serious and calculating.

"What?! He— Do you mean it?!" questioned a surprised Rhida, now pleading to Jomi.

"*Ahem,* I am an extension of Mijo, even though I don't share memories with him here in the dark world, I think.. do you know his pink notebook he carries around?" explained Jomi, now staring at Rhida.

"Ah, yes? He sometimes writes in it, probably his diary, what does that have to do with you?" questioned Rhida, as she composes herself a bit more.

"I am that notebook. Since us darkners always has an equivalent in the light world y'know, skeletons are skeletons, et cetera." said Jomi, as she now shows a replica of the pink notebook Mijo had in the light world.

"Woah, I didn't know that! So, uh.. Since you are technically but not really him, y'know what he likes and stuff?" questioned Rhida, getting straight to her idea.

"Hehe, now that's complicated.. Guess I should help you and myself. Hmm.. He.." said Jomi, looking to Rhida.

"He.. what? Tell me, please! I promise I will do good with it.." said Rhida, looking excited in anticipation.

"He's single, and can be taken. Find out his hobbies, personality and secrets for yourself. You'll need to work hard for it." said Jomi, now smiling.

"Ah.. Better than I expected! Thanks Jomi so much! I promise, ok? Next time, I'll tell you everything, I will keep your secret." said Rhida very happily, looking around to make sure no one hears them.

"Good, the others will probably come and get us now. Just, try not to be too excited now, hehe.." said Jomi as she looks behind her and sees Mijo and Mack coming to their position.

"Hey! Jomi, and.. Rhida.. We're having a group meeting, and they need you all to be there!" shouted Mijo, as he scanned the area.

"We're coming! Go back, we'll follow you!" responded Jomi, as they began walking back to the camp.

"Ok! We'll be going— Huh? You wanna speak to Rhida? Sure, Jomi, come on, you had your private talk." said Mijo, as he listened to a barely hearable Mack whispering in his ear.

"Sure! See ya'!" said Jomi, going with Mijo as Mack ran to Rhida.

"Hey Rhida! So how are you? Are you fine?" questioned Mack as they followed the two to the camp.

"Y— Yeah.. Um, so I just got a deal with Jomi to tell me everything about _him_, y'know?" said Rhida, as they walked.

"Oh nice! How are you sure that she is telling the truth? I mean, she could tell anything, right? and why would she?" questioned Mack, as they stopped near the group.

"I.. can't tell you, it is pretty important for her and him, and she said to not tell anyone." explained Rhida, before both of them got closer to the group.

"I.. don't get it, but I understand.. It is between lovers, as they say." said Mack as they went near Fexili who was talking to JR about colors.

"Oh, Mack and Rhida are here, alright let's start this... Jomi! You start!" said JR to the group, looking to Jomi for some answers.

"Uh, *ahem.* Hello everyone, I.. officially welcome you to the dark world, and.. uh what do you all call this group?" said Jomi, now smiling.

"How would I know, I only just joined!" said Lauvielle, clearly joking.

"Jomi... We're called.. the.. Mijo! What's the name of the gc again?" said JR as he now directed the attention of the group to Mijo.

"Uh, dark world for lightners? That's not a good name now, since it's for us, _including_ Jomi." said Mijo, now thinking of a name.

"Hey, hey... How about 'The Dark Pearl' since, y'know?" said Urda, nervously smiling and looking to Mijo for help.

"Great name! Ok, that— Jomi! Why don't we move on now that we have a name?" said Mijo, now shaking and staring at Jomi.

"Ok, sure. The Dark Pearl it is! Now let's move on to the next one, so.. before anyone asks any questions, I am going to say the gist of this world so that everyone's on the same page. So—" said Jomi, as she looked around the group with mixed feelings.

"Ohh! Sorry, but.. Urda wasn't that a reference to a pirate movie?" said Jamise, as she playfully makes a face to Urda.

"Y- yeah... Can we move on now? thank you..", said Urda, as she began to slowly hide behind JR.

"Hey—" said JR, before Jomi continued, "*Ahem,* yes.. That's a good name, congrats Urda. But uh so yes, so this world is cold, a never-ending winter, as I said earlier to the three—" Jomi points to Rhida, Lauvielle and Leviente, "—only these artifacts can stop it, and not even permanently. That's why we need to speak to the queen, as she probably has the dark fountain somewhere and she holds the knowledge that will save this world from eternal winter." explained Jomi, as she dumps a lot of info on the group.

"Oh so we basically just need to go to her and ask for help? Simple enough, come on guys, let's—" said Jamise, as she excitedly waited for the adventure to fully start.

"Yeah, but we have to consider all of the possibilities, based on the info from Mijo and Urda, the first world was hostile, the second was hostile, turned friendly, and so the third one will likely be friendly, turned hostile." said JR, as the group discusses the next leg of their journey.

"Ohh! Ah wait we can't forget what we saw down that cave, Jomi, what is the meaning of this!" as she holds the paper that holds the name of the artifact.

"Uh, oh right! Mijo, could you translate it again?" questioned Jomi to Mijo, as the group discussed things.

"Ugh, hmm yeah still is 'The Mountaineer's Timepiece'..." said Mijo, looking disappointed.

"Hmm, interesting.. The 'Mountaineer'?, according to the archives, she was a lightner, who before disappearing forever, created the Set of Neverending Winter, which are 5 artifacts that have a way of fighting against the cold." explained Jomi, as the group listened.

"So you mean that there are more than the timepiece? Oooh new treasure!" said Jamise, now getting even more excited.

"Is this the lore part, because... zZZ _sleeps_." said JR, as the group discussed the city.

"He— Hey! I thought _you_ were the responsible guy?!" said Jamise, looking at JR.

"Uuh, oh? Yeah, but I am kinda getting bored because we've been here for 15 minutes talking, and not fighting. Also, I think we know enough to be fine." said JR, as he looks at his knife.

"We're almost done, ok? So what I can conclude is that there is a kingdom here ruled by a queen that met a lightner named the mountaineer then together they tried to solve the cold until that lightner disappeared and now the abyss, us and the kingdom are now trying to get the artifacts. Any other questions?" said Jomi, before Mijo answers, "No! Please, Jomi..", then Jomi nodded to the answer, indicating that discussion was over and now the group exhales, their history discussion over.

"Wooo! Can we celebrate with some drinks, I brought some!" said Mijo, bringing out RoyalCo drinks.

"Yeah! Umm, you have some water?" said Rhida, trying to not drink too early.

"Yeah, fair enough.. I'll save these drinks for later, here. Water, helps ya live." said Mijo, as he gives the group water.

"Wait, you brought water, how many? I.. barely have food items, much less drink items?!" said Urda, as she sips water.

"Uh, preparedness? Anyways, I have like 20 foods, 10 drinks with RoyalCo included and that's it. I didn't keep much as I am supposed to be fast, like you!" said Mijo, as the group finishes their break.

"Ok, let's go guys! Come on, probably more enemies ahead anyway.." said Jomi, as the group picks up their things at the camp and moves through the winter, keeping their artifact in hand as JR distributes it. They fight through hordes of abyss monsters, encountering no actual order members until they find a darkner fighting some abyss monsters.

"You monsters shall be extinguished under the emerald-ruby light! Die!" shouts an unknown darkner as they fight through abyss monsters.

"Hey guys, stop! An actual native, look!" said Mijo as he looks to the darkner fighting.

"Huh? Hey! Help me here!" shouted the darkner as Jomi and JR went and killed the monsters.

"Oh, thanks for that. Hmmm, ah! You appear to be Jomi, the guest of our kingdom, and you? Hmm—" said the darkner as JR interrupted and said, "I'm JR, part of Jomi's.. entourage. We are lightners, here to guard.. Miss Jomi."

"Oh! Right, she did say that. Well I'm Sasha, a silver guard, welcome to Dajovy! At least, the outskirts... I see that you were on the road of connection, which was the original place where our great queen met the mountaineer, I trust that you will be able to.. hold on, is he leaving?" said Sasha, as JR leaves and Jomi stands there confused.

"Uh, oh. Yeah he tends to do that, don't worry. He uh doesn't care about that type of thing that much, he's uh a straightforward guy I'll give him that." said Jomi as she and Sasha went to the lightners discussing something.

"Woah, like an actual friendly darkner other than Jomi? That's surprising." said Mijo, as Jomi and Sasha appear.

"Hey, so we can go to the city now, we just have to follow her, um her name is Sasha, in case you didn't hear that, she's a silver guard of Dajovy." said Jomi, as the group one-by-one greets Sasha.

"Ok, lightners! Oh, umm i meant, Jomi and her loyal entourage, I will personally escort you to the city. There are abyss monsters all around, but.." said Sasha before running out of words to say.

"We will be fine, right? We sa— I mean, helped you with those monsters, so we should be fine, right?" questioned Lauvielle, as Sasha thinks for a while.

"Uhh oh! Sorry, it's just nothing. Um, they probably won't do anything.. yet." said Sasha as she led them to the city.

"Huh? Who?" said Jomi, as she prepares her blade.

"Ahh! Sorry, sorry, I just.. ugh. I guess you would have found out anyway. The queen is heavily strict when it is about.. the civil war." said Sasha as the group's suspicions went down.

"The civil war...? Woah what the—" said Mijo before Jomi interrupts, "Oh, I can guess why.. Hmm, there was this sense of eerieness in the town, and then I heard blades hit as some guys fight. That was the fighting no?"

"Ah! So you would have known already! Uh, so sorry for doing that but it is the queen's orders, and I trust her majesty. Um, yeah basically that, I also realized that either her majesty or princess Jomi brings it up, so there's no point! Sorry about that, uhh let's go!" said Sasha as they continue walking down the path. The group talks about random stuff before arriving at the town.

"So, that is why I am right and you're wrong." said Lauvielle to Leviente.

"Nah, nope. Your evidence is not based on any reality and—" said Leviente before Jomi nudged them to stop.

"We're here, Dajovy Town. I hope you enjoy your stay! As for me, my mission was protecting the outskirts and I'll continue to do that, so see you!" said Sasha before going out to the outskirts.

"Huh, really courteous of that girl.. Hey! Where's your commanding officer?" shouted Mijo to a random silver guard.

"As part of the silver guards, I am obligated to say that you just met her, General Sasha of the 1st Corps." said the silver guard, as the group is shocked.

"Ah that's why... She was secretive about the information, because she's the general of the army here..." said JR as the group agreed.

"Well, let's head to their capital building, then. Um, where is it, silver guard?" said Jomi to the same silver guard.

"As you all are part of a foreign entourage, I am obligated to answer that it is literally straight ahead." said the silver guard, with a hint of sarcastic annoyance.

"Oh, sorry! Guys come on, it's literally straight ahead." said Jomi as the group ran to the building ahead of them that has a huge flight of stairs.

"Hello, me and my entourage are here for the queen." said Jomi as the silver guard looked at his paper, looked at Jomi then let the group pass through.

As they go up the stairs, the eeriness of the town begins to set in as the place is eerily quiet even though it's supposed to be a huge town. Eventually they make it up to the door, where two silver guards open up the doors to reveal the queen standing behind her desk, looking out of the window. As a silver guard talks to her, a silver-haired girl.

"Mo— Madam Svetlana, what Sasha says is true! So why—" said the girl, before the queen said to the girl, "Jomi and her entourage are here. Go back to Sasha and tell her to stand by for any orders, Anastasia."

Then the girl looked at the lightners with disdain as she leaves and they walk to where she was and they are now in front of the queen.

"Hello. You may call me, Svetlana, you may also call me queen, but now I would like to be referred to as the supreme guardian of Dajovy. Now, let's talk about why, you are here. Lightners." said Svetlana as the group collectively grouped up and talked, then Jomi spoke up, "We are here because of the recent fountain and the abyss activities in this area."

"Oh, I see. The fountain, you say? You mean the darkness that powers this world? The abyss too, they have been affecting the.. situation around." said Svetlana as the group listened closely.

"Yep! So that is why I am here, to get rid of the abyss. The lightners are here to seal the fountain, it's for all of our sake, so trust me on this, Svetlana." said Jomi as the queen visibly shakes then stops suddenly.

"Hmm, sure. Just.. Let me take some lightners with me to the fountain, it is heavily guarded and so will need me." said Svetlana, as the group whispered between themselves.

"I see. I will personally lead this group, to gain more trust, as I am a darkner myself. I will bring.. Rhida, JR, Mack and Fexili with me. Mijo's group will take care of the abyss for you, just tell them where to go." said Jomi, as the group agreed with her plan.

"Sure. I agree with this plan, with one exception. Sasha must lead the other group. She will guide the lightners to the proper place." said Svetlana as the group agreed again.

"Ok, it is settled. Should we go now, or later?" said Jomi as Svetlana smiles but quickly returns to a neutral face.

"Now, would be best. I will send a silver guard to inform Sasha for the abyss group. Come, come with me, Jomi's group." said Svetlana before Jomi's group and her go outside and head to somewhere where Mijo can no longer see.

"Let's go outside too guys, Sasha might be waiting." said Mijo as the group goes outside and sees Sasha rushing to them.

"*Heavy Breathing* Wow, that was on short notice.. Hey! The queen— I mean the supreme guardian told me to accompany you so I am here, let's go!" said Sasha before dragging Mijo, forcing the group to move with her until they reach an underground subway station.

"Hey! Are we supposed to be here? This looks closed off..." said Mijo before they got attacked by unspecified armed people.

"Hey! Stop that! I will arrest you all!" said Sasha before a smoke bomb suddenly covers the entire area.

"Hey! Urda can you teleport and see anything?!" shouted Mijo as gunfire and swords clashed.

"No! I can't focus either, it's some sort of..." said Urda, before suddenly dropping down on the floor.

"Oh shi— Hey! Sasha!" shouted Mijo, as he saw Sasha about to fall.

"Ugh... I'm so sorry..." said Sasha before falling asleep.

"What? What's... ugh shi—" said Mijo before dropping down and sleeping.

"A deal's a deal... Sasha." said an unspecified female voice before Mijo fades into unconsciousness.

*Switching Scene...*

Mijo fades into consciousness as he hears two people argue.

"Look, It was either this, or you being hurt, ok?" said an unspecified female voice.

"Heh? Almost everyone saw it! Even the lightners... This was inevitable, why didn't you inform me?" said Sasha, sounding angry.

"We didn't have time, we knew that the queen was planning something and when you were trusted to go to an abyss spot, we knew where to go." said the unspecified female voice.

"WHAT?! YOU WERE SPYING ON ME?!?" shouted Sasha as she sounded irritated.

Mijo tried to look like he was sleeping, as he wanted to listen in.

"Oh? Um, I might have woken Mijo up.. Woops.." said Sasha as Mijo feels someone waking him up.

"Hey there, I am Natascha, a doctor in Dajovy. I have received your friends here, after a certain smoke bomb knocked out all of you. Though, you are the last one to wake up, as the others have gone into the town." said Natascha, as Sasha looks at Mijo apologetically.

"Um, sorry for waking you up, I just had a heated moment with Natascha here, uh... yeah.." said Sasha, as she looked down, feeling embarrassed.

"It's nothing, Sasha... I am just wondering... Where the hell am I? Because this place looks nothing like the buildings that I saw earlier." said Mijo as he looked out of the hospital window.

"Oh, right. Sasha, would you care to mention where we are?" said Natascha as Sasha goes near Mijo.

"So. what you see is the underground. A place where the people would usually mine emeralds, rubies and diamonds but nowadays it is closed off due to the abyss threatening the surface and the underground." said Sasha as Mijo begins to realize something.

"Hey, wait. Aren't you supposed to be an army general? If so, why are you here? How did you get beat up by—" said Mijo before Sasha spoke up, "I... I have a lot of issues with how the queen often ignores the abyss issue and keeps the fountain, even though the mountaineer disappeared a long time ago, and has probably not even cared for us.. But you, lightner.. You are the new way.. You seek to seal the dark world, from the abyss and yourselves.. A selfless goal.."

"Um, to be honest.. As much as I want to say it, It is selfish in some cases, we went into this world, expecting adventure. We got it. I do not know what is going through the minds of the others, especially the ones with Svetlana. But what I do know is that I have a duty to see this through, until the end." said Mijo, as Sasha and Natascha processed the information.

"Hmm, I guess that makes sense. I don't know what It feels like to have another world entirely different from mine, much less a world that I don't know.." said Sasha, contemplating.

"I also can make sense of Mijo's words. I have been to the library a lot as a child and I know what I would do, what I should do, but currently I am a doctor, and I have a duty of healing." said Natacsha as the door opened to see Urda and Lauvielle coming in.

"Hiii! Me and Urda just went on a bit of a walk and encountered some monsters, so we—" said Lauvielle before being nudged by Urda to stop as they saw the three looking out of the window.

"Oh? Well, I should get back to my doctor duties.. Sasha, you go talk with them." said Natasha before tending to some patients.

"Oh, uh don't worry! We were just discussing some things, um as you can see, Mijo is awake now, so we can go on that monster hunt now.." said Sasha, now grabbing her scythe placed near some medical boxes.

"Oh, sure. Um— Urda, you have anything else to say?" said Lauvielle, looking at Urda, as Urda was staring off at the general direction of Mijo.

"Uhh— No! Um... Except uh, yeah.. Jamise and Leviente, let's find them too..." said Urda, as the others nodded and they went out of the hospital, saying goodbye to Natascha.

As they went through the town, there is a feel of perseverance as they want to prove to the Supreme Guardian Svetlana that she was wrong and that they will save themselves. At least that was what Mijo was thinking as he saw the people hustle and bustle around the town.

"Wait, what's the name of the town?" questioned Mijo, as the group stopped.

"Oh, right. It's just called Pebble Town." said Sasha, as the two girls behind Mijo laughed.

"Heh? Pebble? Why? Is it like because the founders found a really important pebble or something?" said Mijo, sarcastically, smiling at Sasha.

"Oh, uh.. Natascha told me that the elders said it was because they mined rock and that they would store the excess rock into the town, and since some of it were pebbles, it was decided. Honestly, they should have gone with _Cobble Town,_ it sounds better." explained Sasha, as the three laughed more.

"Huh, well after this, I guess we'll have to request the Supreme Guardian to change that then.. Haha.." said Mijo, as they continued to walk to a nearby checkpoint.

"Hey, These guys are with me." said Sasha to armed guards, as they looked at the group nodded and let them in.

"Hey, what are the names of these guys anyway, like the org they work for?" questioned Mijo, as Lauvielle quickly tried to answer.

"Oh, me! I know this one, me and Urda were just walking around, and I asked a guy to tell me what the names of the armed people are, he said that those are Bonfire members, and I asked why, but.. uh they didn't know." said Lauvielle, as Urda and Mijo nodded, with Sasha turned away from them, contemplating.

"Hmm, yeah— yeah. That's— That's correct, I guess I'll have to ask Nat about that, anyways. Let's go in, we might find your—" said Sasha, before a voice is shouting behind the lightners.

"Hey! Hey! Sasha! N— I mean, Vlad has a situation, and he needs your help near the town plaza!" said the Bonfire member, as Sasha quickly dashes to his place.

"What is it? Some vagrants? Ask someone else, I am managing the lightners right now, is.. it that important?" said Sasha, as the lightners listen in quietly.

"It's not only the vagrants this time, Sasha. It's a silver guard, and looks like an important one at that, I think when I left there were also some lightners there, so you have to go there!" said the bonfire member, as the lightners and Sasha were shocked.

"What?! Ok, I'll be going, send the message back, quick! I'll be taking the lightners with me." said Sasha, as the Bonfire member quickly leaves and the lightners go up to Sasha.

"We heard—" said Lauvielle, before Sasha interrupted, "Yeah, yeah I know. Come on! Before things get worse!" and they quickly started running to the plaza.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's group...*

"What have you done? Svetlana, this is dooming your world. You can't keep using the abyss magic forever." said Jomi, as she sees Svetlana using magic to control Mack, Fexili and Rhida from their exhausted bodies and JR barely surviving near her.

"No, you are simply blind to the _abyss_, you betray us, keeping _us_ from truly being free, once the dark has taken over the light, then you shall see.. Princess." said Svetlana, as Jomi flinches and has a headache, trying to resist the abyss.

"Hey— What are you doing to her? Ugh, you know what, fine. I guess I'll have to kill you _myself_!" said JR, as he unleashed his dark power, damaging Svetlana a bit.

" _Chuckles_ Hmmph, a lightner using the abyss against me? You will never outdo me, _let's dance!_ " said Svetlana as she and JR fight.

*Back to Mijo and friends...*

"Hey, everybody stay calm, just don't hurt the girl, and you will be fine." said Leviente, as Jamise immediately says, "Yeah! You stay back! Or you're gonna get hurt!"

"Hey! What's with all the commotion here? I was called here by Bonfire, what's going on?!" said Sasha, as a bunch of vagrant assassins tried to surprise Leviente and Jamise, but were countered by the rest of the lightners and Sasha.

"Disappear into the sea of the darkness, illusions of the past!" said Sasha, as she quickly cut down the assassins before anyone could react.

"Woah, she uh, she definitely is based on someone." remarked Urda, as the rest of Bonfire cleaned up and dispersed the crowd.

"Ah, as always, Sasha, quick and decisive..." said Vladimir, based on the clothing.

"It was nothing, Chief, just some basic deterrence, anyways... Who is the—" said Sasha as she looked over to see Anastasia, behind Jamise and Leviente.

"Hey! I demand to speak to your boss around here, I have been knocked out and was brought here, who did that? Huh?!" said Anastasia as soon as she saw Sasha.

"Oh, uh him!" said Sasha, pointing to Vladimir, now somewhat amused.

"Alright lady, you're not safe around these parts, Bonfire can only do so much, so you better stick to these _lightners_... As for your predicament, there were always vagrants near the blockaded areas, I guess you ran into them and someone had to grab you down to the clinic?" said Vladimir as Anastasia calmed down and the lightners grouped up again.

"Ugh, fine. These.. lightners.. Whatever, just.. huh, um wait... **Sasha?!** You better explain yourself!" said Anastasia, as Sasha was caught off guard and was surprised.

"Uh, um. This is bad... Uh, Mijo can you do it?" said Sasha, as Mijo, slightly amused, agreed and went in front of Sasha.

"Ok, so uh... She told me that—" said Mijo, before Anastasia interrupted, "Oh! Wait— **Sorry!** I just thought you and my Sasha looked similar, Sasha is a common name anyway.. Um, what were you about to say?"

"Uh, we were going to say that, _whispers to Sasha,_ "What do i say??" said Mijo, as Sasha responded, whispering, "Uh, that... that... I know who the Sasha you were referring to and that we used to interact back then... yeah."

"She knows the Sasha you were referring to and that they were friends before she joined the silver guards. Yeah." said Mijo, as Sasha breathed a sigh of relief as Anastasia nodded, hiding something.

"Ok, then. Ok, what do we do now?" said Anastasia, as the lightners, Bonfire and Anastasia gathered.

"Ok, so let's get back to what Sasha was going to do before this whole situation happened." said Vladimir, as some stared at Sasha.

"Um, we were about to head off into disputed territory with the other vagrants who set up there.. Why?" said Sasha as they now looked at Vladimir.

"Well, now we have gotten reports of... Misha's robots taking over the area. For some reason I don't know yet." said Vladimir, as the lightners were surprised by this revelation.

"Huh, robots? Didn't know you guys had those? Are they advanced?" questioned Mijo, as Vladimir smiled.

"Yeah, we have those... By advanced, do you mean enough to battle and support mining crews on their own? Because those aren't even the best, they're just the remaining ones." said Vladimir, feeling proud and at the same time reminiscent.

"Ok, we'll get all the time we want later, but this robot crisis, Chief, you remember what happened at Weld Town?"

"Yeah, anyways, so you, the lightners and the silver guard go ahead there. I still have to talk with.. the other members for some reinforcements and plans." said Vladimir before the others agreed and Vladimir said goodbye to the group before going with Bonfire.

"Ok, we should probably rest for a while, since even I need rest, hey why not take this time to talk with the others, Mijo?" said Sasha, as the group splintered to people sitting at the floor, the bench, standing, etc.

"Uh sure. How long are we staying here?" questioned Mijo, then Sasha answered, "Around.. I'll tell everyone when we go, ok?"

"Ok." responded Mijo, before Sasha lays down on a bench nearby and rests.

"Now, I am wondering what Jomi's group is up to, though now knowing that Svetlana is a bit suspicious at least, probably not good." wondered Mijo to himself, before going to Urda to speak about it.

*Meanwhile at the JR and Svetlana fight..*

"Huh?! How.. are you stronger than me?! You are a lightner, how can you maintain the abyss for so long?" questioned Svetlana, as JR pierced her heart forcing her to break control of her puppets.

"Ugh... Wait, what.." said Rhida weakly as she looked at the battlefield with Svetlana trying to heal as Jomi rose back up, and Mack and Fexili preparing their spears again.

"RHIDA! MACK! FEXILI! RETREAT!" shouted Jomi, as JR temporarily blinded Svetlana with an attack on her eyes, due to her lowered guard.

"OK!" said Mack and Fexili as they both went to Jomi, while Rhida started to fly with a touch of ice.

"What is she doing??!" said Jomi, as Rhida began to intensify the snowstorm around them.

"Wait, I know what she's doing, quick Jomi, retreat!" said JR, as he began to power up Rhida.

"What— Mack and Fexili, go! JR! You're exhausting yourself! As long as that fountain and the abyss haven't been dealt with, she will come back." said Jomi, as Mack and Fexili run for their lives.

"Well... We have you, Jomi." said JR, as Rhida unleashes 'Winter Storm' freezing Svetlana, as Rhida and JR both fainted, leaving the area quiet, as Jomi uses a bit of her powers to dash to Rhida and JR to get them to a better place.

*Back to Mijo and friends...*

"Yeah, she is a bit sus, like even if the problem is that she needs to take care of two threats, at different places, why doesn't she just send all of us and like Sasha on the way?" said Urda, as Mijo nodded, before Sasha went to them and told them, "Hey, let's go now."

They started heading to the place Sasha mentioned, however, Sasha was at the front, as none of the lightners remembered where they were and they were most concerned with Anastasia, who was worried about her safety as well as something else, as she was looking around, even though if she got attacked, her assailants would be disintegrated.

"Hey, we're here. Huh, Nat is here..." said Sasha as they saw Natascha talking with some miners.

"Hey Nat! Um, what's the situation..?" questioned Sasha, as Natascha finished her conversation and looked at Sasha.

"Oh, hi! So the situation is that some... Bonfire members are trying to talk to some of the vagrants as the robots push out the vagrants and.. Bonfire from the area." said Natascha, as the lightners listen.

"Oh, ok. Thanks!" said Sasha, as she goes to speak with the lightners.

"Soo what are we doing.. Sasha?" said Lauvielle, as Sasha thought about it.

"Let's go in. As one group, since Chief Vladimir, is probably sending to other areas, so let's just cut through to get to the robots, and the vagrants, to 'negotiate' with them." said Sasha, as the group agreed and went inside the great mine.

"Ok, let's go!" said Lauvielle, as the group went down the cave network, fighting robots and vagrants alike, until they reach some miners and vagrants fighting.

"HEY! y'all are in our territory, get out! Trust me, you do not want to challenge Bonfire around these parts..." said a miner.

"Heh, Bonfire? Aren't they getting their asses kicked with Misha's robots around 'ere? Besides there's no way—" said a vagrant as the group enter his sights.

"Looking for trouble, vagrant?" said Sasha as the vagrants got surprised by Sasha and her group.

"Ah! Bonfire, well I suppose we'll have to settle our differences, the hard way!" said the vagrant before they attacked the miners and the group.

The fight begins as Sasha shields the miners, and slashes the miners as Mijo and Urda stay behind, since they both know if they intervene, it's an easy win, and they want to see some action. Meanwhile Lauvielle and Leviente also stayed near them, as they had no powers yet, however Jamise decided to support Sasha by blasting some vagrants as well as shielding Sasha. After a fierce battle where Sasha got teamed up by the vagrants before Jamise casted an explosive spell which sent the vagrants running and the fight was over.

"Whew, that was tough! Though, honestly those vagrants where nothing, especially since we didn't intervene, y'know? Not ruin a new players experience, et cetera.." said Mijo, as Sasha goes to the miners to talk about something.

"Haha, guys? After this, I might not want to be going into these worlds, well— I could, but uh you guys have like super awesome magic and uh we still don't have ours, hehe so I might not be destined for this world..." said Lauvielle, as Leviente agreed and asked Mijo, "Hmm how do you get these powers? You said that most of the group here only got their powers through sheer will and desperation, like you when you were fighting those skeletons, or Rhida, when you told me she used her ice powers to save you?"

"True! But we still don't know much, Jomi said the same thing, and so far, that's what's been happening, I still feel like Jomi is hiding something again..." said Urda, as Jamise joins in and says, "Yeah! The power getting thing is weird! Like, really really weird, I got mine when I was fighting a huge statue of honrato!" as Lauvielle and Leviente audibly gasped at the words of Jamise.

"I.. I.. guess with the power of love, is how you gain it? I think?" said Lauvielle as Leviente added, "Two ways, friendships, as seen with Jamise and well romantic, with Rhida."

"Hmm, you're right. Well we better share this with Jomi, huh, is Sasha done talking to those miners over there?" said Mijo, as they look to Sasha talking with some miners.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's group..*

"Shi— I can't find the two, they must be somewhere here, still I am probably in great danger, I can't figure out if Svetlana sent the order out to kill all of us, or not, still I have to be careful, I have two unconscious bodies, and they might be in danger.. Hold on, how did they both utilize abyss power against Svetlana..? Whatever, that's a question I'll have to ask later, wait.. I think I see the two.." said Jomi, as she sees Mack and Fexili, having their spears out against unsuspecting silver guards.

"Hey! You stay back! I don't know what you did, but your leader tried to kill us!" said Mack, as Fexili looked around and saw Jomi hiding behind a house, peeking towards them.

"Hey, psst— Jomi's looking at us, I think she might not like us getting the silver guard's attention, quick let's just... uh how do we go invisible using magic again?" said Fexili to Mack as he listens in.

"Uhh let's just run! Yeah, I bet she can think of something, come on!" said Mack, as they both run from their current position to Jomi being disappointed at what they're doing but accepting it and looking to see if any silver guards are following.

"Hey! Jomi!" said Mack, as they both hide behind the building and Jomi casts a protection spell that projects that the alley they're on is empty.

As they both recover from their fast run, and look at Jomi, they see a tired and somewhat serious expression, as they look to see Rhida and JR unconscious.

"Ah!! Are they dead?!" said Fexili, as Mack goes behind him with a worried expression.

"Hmm, they're not dead. But their magic is completely spent. Using that amount of magic without a high enough stamina will do.. this. Like.. hmmm... You know when you feel so tired that all you want to do is sleep? That's what they feel right now, and with their use, natural regeneration might take a day or two to take effect—" said Jomi, as the two gasped audibly at this statement.

"However, I can heal them, it's just that I am already spending some magic protecting us here, and I was just recovering from the battle so.. we need to get back to Mijo's group, I am just wondering where they are right now..." said Jomi, as the two speculate, "We should probably look around the city, I think Svetlana said something about a place where Sasha knows, but where could that be?" said Mack, speculating on the words.

*Back to Mijo and the gang!*

"You're telling me, we're stuck here, because we can't repair a MINE CART??" said Lauvielle, as the group collectively stares at the minecart, broken and blocking them.

"Sasha might, but she's behind us with Anastasia, looking for something. I guess you guys figure it out? I am gonna look for them." said Mijo, as he heads off behind them and searches for the two ladies until he finds them picking out some scraps.

"What... is this?" said Anastasia, as Sasha picks up some parts of a minecart.

"This is a minecart piece, more specially..." said Sasha, before Mijo talks, "Hey! I notice that y'all have been here for quite a while. It's just that we have a broken minecart up ahead, and none of us know how to fix it."

"Oh, well this is just perfect. Princess, you'll finally understand how us darkners do things around here!" said Sasha, as she grabs another piece, and Anastasia visibly dismisses it like a pointless insult.

Then they head back to the group who managed to collectively push the minecart away and they see the three going near them.

"Stop! What are you doing?! Well, i guess even the lightners— don't know. Anyway, let me see..." said Sasha as she checked the mine cart, "The pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, the rear wheelset bearing too... Damn, definitely robot behavior. If i was them I would have just destroyed the whole thing.. Well, I got these parts, in handy. Now—"

"Wait! Guys, let's show that we can totally repair mine carts, Leviente, Urda, let's check it!" said Mijo, as he went near the mine cart to repair it along with the other two.

"U— Ugh. Fine... You better not waste those parts..." said Sasha, as the others watch the three try to fix it, and after a while, they did!

"Whew.. That almost broke. I— We are lucky." said Mijo as the two push the minecart away sending it through the opening, and letting the group pass.

"Yeah. This is a way of learning things, not just from school, but also from experience!" said Leviente, as Mijo and Urda nodded.

"Ok, ok, Leviente. Let's go!!!" said Jamise, as she dragged Lauvielle and grabbed Urda towards the exit.

"Haha! Coming! Hey, Mijo you going with them?" questioned Leviente, as the three were heard in the background, talking about something.

"I gotta talk to these two—" Mijo points to Sasha and Anastasia. "—you guys can survive, come on. You have.. Urda, and Jamise too, but she might be starting fights, so.. oh and Lauvielle." said Mijo, before they waved as the two darkners talked with Mijo.

"Your.. group. They are like me when i was a teen, always excited and going around being all 'cool' only to get dragged by my parents back home, hehe... Well, I guess I can only thank them for that." said Sasha, as Mijo smiled.

"Yeah. Teenagers, wait. Are you all, teens?" said Anastasia, as Mijo responded with, "Yeah, pretty much. It's their first time being alone and fighting like this, I mean, me too, but I've grown accustomed to talking more confidently and.. I hate to say it, maturely?"

"Hmm, I wouldn't say it like that, but I did notice how you were the leader, so you were more serious than your companions and that... Jomi. She seemed similar to you, but I couldn't say much." said Sasha, as Anastasia looks at Sasha.

"You mean Princess Jomi? Wait, I heard that she and the supreme guardian went to close the fountain, you think they succeeded?" questioned Anastasia, to both Sasha and Mijo.

"I.. doubt that. I just have a feeling, that either way I see it, it's a suicide mission." said Mijo, as Sasha nodded in agreement and said, "Yeah. Whatever plan.. Svetlana has, is likely leading them into slaughter, otherwise why would she.. hm."

"What? What's wrong?" said Anastasia, as Sasha suddenly remembered that she was trying to hide her true identity to Anastasia.

"Um.. like Mijo told me, they were separated into two groups, and as I see it, this was an excuse to kill off the other half while the others get distracted. Like in Mil... combat..." said Sasha as Anastasia looks at her smiling.

"Oh, uh we should probably go—" said Mijo before Anastasia interrupts, "Are you in a hurry, Mijo? I want to say something that I want you to stay here for.", Mijo nodded.

"I.. should probably say that.. Hey, Sasha. I.. know you're the same Sasha from the surface." said Anastasia, as the two were surprised by this.

"Wha— What??? What makes you say that??" Sasha whispers to Mijo, "Help me here!" Mijo responds, "This convo is more suspicious, I'll try but.. hear her out first, hmm?", Sasha begrudgingly nodded and listened to Anastasia.

"After the whole debacle at the plaza, and I sat down to recollect my thoughts, I immediately knew you were lying, but... I don't blame you, after all, it was tense. But as I realized this, at that moment I decided to keep it to myself and see what Sasha's 'friend' does in the underground. It was.. exactly how I remember you, and after we were alone, collecting some parts... I have decided to tell you that it's fine. You don't need to hide yourself. I.. I.. know what it feels to hide your true self in front of others." said Anastasia, as Sasha is silent, trying to process things.

Then, Sasha stops herself from almost crying, then says, "Y— Yeah.. Ok. Um.. Just.. um. Mijo uh.. can you wait a few more minutes? We have to talk." said Sasha, referring to Anastasia, as Mijo said, "Sure.. Uh, can I listen?"

"Yeah, fine. I already revealed my.. inner thoughts. So, it's fine. Just, hehe.. shut your mouth ok?" said Sasha, as Anastasia visibly notices this, but doesn't say anything, looking at Sasha instead. "Sure. Just, continue." said Mijo, as he listened more and turned his back, allowing them more privacy.

"Ok.. Uh. I am sure, you have a lot of questions, and.. I wanna know what they are, before.. saying anything." said Sasha, before Sasha nodded, and said, "Thank you, first, why did you join the silver guards? I.. remember what you said back then, 'for the people' is what you said, so.. can you elaborate?"

"Uh, well. It is true. I've always fought for the people, and saw how the civil war ruined any chances of this being true, I was disillusioned.. After Bonfire found me, they took me in as a member, as a spy. Now, this, what you're seeing is my old suit, the one I picked out before joining the silver guards." said Sasha, as Anastasia nodded.

"I see. I noticed, your fighting style, no matter if scythe or sword, you fight the same way, quickly separating you from other silver guards.  I.. have another question, did you.. live here, before the war? I.. have always lived in the palace... But something is familiar about you.." said Anastasia, as Sasha thought about it.

"Um, yeah. I lived here, and after joining, moved to the surface. I mean, I guess there were a lot of kids in Nat's orphanage... But.. I don't know what's so familiar about me, aren't you the daughter of Svetlana? Are you confusing our duty together with your childhood?" explained Sasha, as Anastasia visibly is questioning herself but continues.

"I.. *ahem* We'll see. For the last question, I.. wanna ask you, how did you get here?" questioned Anastasia, as Sasha thought of a way to say what she wanted to say, "Uh.. Just, I.. um. Well, same as you..."

"Ok I understand. We're fine? We can continue and support the other lightners, at least.. for now?" questioned Anastasia, as Sasha nodded and nudged Mijo to turn to them.

"Oh, uh. I see. I guess we can go now. Come on, those idiots might be fighting the boss robot.. Who is it again..?" questioned Mijo, as they started to walk to the rest of the group. "Misha, Vlad knew the creator of that robot, Mikhail, but he died due to the abyss and civil war happening. So now the robot is managing the remaining robots, and has adopted a girl, her name is.. Polina, I think?" explained Sasha as they saw the group looking over a drop, where Misha and Polina can be seen overlooking the mine.

"Guys! Shhh be quiet! Those look like the people Sasha was talking about.." said Lauvielle quietly, prompting the three to stop, and look at the two below.

"Look at this place, Polina. It has been time and time that humans have fought over this place. Between the blockade and the war, I must be set on making the underground a peaceful place." said Misha, as they looked over the main part of the mine, over the recently fought over land between vagrants and Bonfire.

"I understand, Mr. Misha, but.. how the others feel.. I am not sure they like what we're doing.." said Polina, as she contemplates the events happening.

"It is.. part of humanity that their emotions can guide them. But, as a machine, I must follow this rule, Polina. My calculations are what I follow and it is logical, based on variables already there." said Misha, as he heard a small rumble in a cliff near their spot.

"I suspect Bonfire has already made it here." said Misha, before Sasha appears dashing through and appearing near them. Then Sasha says, "Yeah, sure did. Now, leave— or.. I'll make you leave." 

"As a high level threat, you are a dangerous, volatile variable. But, as there are external variables to account for, it is the best to leave this mine. More robot casualties for the sake of delaying the inevitable is not something I am programmed to do. Let's go, Polina." said Misha, as he gets a big command robot, to deal with Sasha.

"I trust you, Mr. Misha, Big Bert, protect our escape, ok?" said Polina, as Misha and her leave the mine, leaving the big robot to face Sasha.

"Really? Ugh... Hey! Lightners, help me here..!" shouted Sasha, as Anastasia, and Jamise dropped  down near her, spreading out.

"As a silver guard, I must protect and help fellow silver guards. So I am here." said Anastasia, then Jamise said, "Well, I am here to help fellow friends! That's all."

The robot looked at them and charged its chainsaw, presumably was used for logging, now used to battle against them. First, Sasha dashes in, using her scythe, blocking and attacking the robot, as Anastasia provided fire support. Jamise provided the shield to Anastasia, and also supported Sasha. From above, the others can be seen watching. 

"Hey, Leviente, you should get in the action, y'know, experience?" said Mijo, as they watched the fight. 

"Huh, good point. But, I don't think I can contribute much without any weapons..." said Leviente, before Lauvielle quickly said, "Hey, hey! Yeah— yeah, no need! It's *pretty* dangerous there, so.. just stay put.. hmm?", then she glares at Mijo.

Mijo looked unfazed but continued, "Yeah. Well, here—", Mijo gives his katana to Leviente, "—it's a good weapon, sharp and effective.", Leviente inspects the weapon, comparing it to his knowledge of swords.

"Um, lola... I think I know what Mijo's trying to say, so here—", Urda gives Lauvielle a cutlass, then as she inspected the sword, she said, "What's this.. oh, like.. a pirate sword..? Hey! I mean, a— aren't you two a bit worried we might.. die?"

Mijo and Urda looked at each other, then Mijo turned to Lauvielle and said, "Well, as I said, you can only get the powers through this, and well..", Mijo looks at the battle then looks at the two of them, "it's the perfect opportunity, so go!"

"He's right, lola. We should." said Leviente, before looking at the battle, "There'll be a lot of battles in the future. Let's start now.", continued Leviente. Lauvielle thought about it, then nodded, saying, " *big sigh* Ugh.. Fine..! You only live once...", before the two dropped down, supporting Sasha, with their limited combat knowledge.

They continued watching the battle below, as the five moved around the robot until Sasha decided to end it. "Disappear among the dark, illusions of the past!", said Sasha, before cutting through the robot in quick motions, the slashes making reality look like cut glass, before she stopped behind it, damaging it a ton, causing the glass to shatter.

"Hey! Why isn't it—" said Lauvielle before Sasha gets suddenly attacked by the robot, luckily she managed to deflect it with her scythe but she was pushed back to a wall, and was forced to retreat to Anastasia's side.

"What the... The bot, it's still working?!", said Sasha, as the bot turns to face the five in the same direction. "Due to the damage its taken, it's more aggressive and offense is stronger, at least, that's what I know about these robots.." said Anastasia, as the robot targets Sasha.

"Oh come on! Just because I am a Bonfire member?!" said Sasha as she deflects and dodges the robot, as it gets pummeled by the others.

"Should we.. intervene?" said Urda to Mijo, as they watched the five try to destroy the robot.

"Nah, if it's necessary, then we'll do, but it seems they're doing fine, no jinx! hopefully..." responded Mijo, as they quietly watched the five.

Then the robot decided to use its other hand, charging its blast at Anastasia, before Sasha went in front of her and blocked it, causing her great exhaustion.

"*Heavy Breathing* Oh shi..." said Sasha as she watched Lauvielle and Leviente double team the robot but they got countered and were pushed back. Then it decided to pressure Jamise who was getting tired.

"Oh no! Oh no! Guys! Help me here! I can't keep this shield up forever..!" shouted Jamise, as Lauvielle and Leviente attempted to distract the  robot again before getting pushed back.

"I have to— hhngh— Ah.." said Sasha as she tried to dash to Jamise, but her power was spent.

"Ahh!" shouted Jamise, as her shield broke, and the robot managed to almost knock her out using its chainsaw. "Ah... Your— turn...", as she attempts to heal herself discretely. The robot turned to Lauvielle and Leviente who were pretty much down, as they barely managed to stand and keep their blades close.

"Oh no! Mijo let's—" said Urda, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, you go distract it and we try to kill it! Go!", as they dropped down, and moved in seperate directions.

"Hey! Come here!" shouted Urda as she dodged and shot the robot, distracting it to her. "Hey, Leviente, can I have that back, oh and that too, Lauvielle..", as both hand Mijo their respective swords. Then he moved away from them.

"Hehe, time for some action! Big robot! *Let's dance!* " said Mijo, before joining in the fight. He used his katana and the cutlass to dual wield blocking and deflecting shots and slashes of the robot, as Urda supports using her modified pistol to quickly burst shots between dodges. However after a lot of fighting, suddenly Mijo messed up one block and got stabbed directly in the heart. 

"NO! MIJO!!!" shouted Urda, as Mijo barely managed to say, "Why— hn— does this always— ah! happen to me...?" as he fell to the ground with the two swords.

"THAT'S IT! NYAAA!" shouted Urda, as she dashed and got the cutlass as she shot and slashed multiple times, weakening the robot.

"Wait! Sasha, stay here." said Anastasia, as she jumped to immobilize the robot's chainsaw right arm, she jumped on its arm then she stabbed it, decommissioning its chainsaw arm. But the robot pushed Anastasia away, as she used all her power to do so.

"Hah! You're already dead! Golden Wind!" shouted Urda as she charged her ultimate, but as she did, with the robot's remaining power, it blasted Urda with greater force, she deflected it however it took all of her energy.

"Alrighty.. It's a.. little tough.. Hah..." said Urda, as she sat on the ground, left to watch as the robot tried to heal itself, deeming all threats neutralized.

*Meanwhile at.. Mijo's mind?*

" *Heavy Breathing* Ah, what the.. what is this? this.. looks like my backyard... And yet... WHY am I still stabbed?!" said Mijo, as he looked around and went near his sword, stabbed to the ground, like a sword stuck to a rock.

"Huh..? What..? This.. is my sword! I.. is this the afterlife?" said Mijo, as he felt the pain in his stabbed heart get stronger. "A— and that too... Ahh!!! Ugh...", he looked around for any signs of life, until a portal opened in front of him.

"Hi. I am—", the figure stopped and stared at Mijo. "Who.. oh.", said Mijo as he looked more attentively to the figure, and they were Jomi.

"Nevermind. You know who I am." said Jomi, as she goes near him slowly, with a serious look on her face.

"Uh.. Jomi..? You know where we are?" said Mijo, as he continues to look at Jomi, inching ever closer to Mijo.

"It is about what you can guess. Your mind, and this is a creation of it. But the reason you're not dead..." said Jomi, before she pulled out the chainsaw, making Mijo drop to the floor as a response.

"Ahh! *cough* thanks. I couldn't get that out.. So, um.. what?", as he turned to Jomi, who was behind him.

"Is... you possess a will, determination. That is so strong, it can resist death. 'Death' however, is.. temporary, or not. But you, you possess the power to completely change this world, which is why you are part of the prophecy. As for her, I believe that's for another time." explained Jomi, as Mijo stared at her with astonishment as to her words.

"What..? So, like you have time now, to explain this to me..? Why?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi went past him, back to where she was and said, "Wake up, trailblazer. You can't die here, stay determined, Mijo.", before she left through a portal.

"No! Fuck.. She.. really.. ugh. I need.. to.. wake up." said Mijo, as he looked at his sword, then he decided to grab it, "Wake me up. Please..?" said Mijo, before he wakes up in the landscape.

He sees Urda on her last legs, as he picks up his two swords and immediately looked around and noticed the robot is almost destroyed, and so he used his magic to charge his ultimate move.

"Hey! Robot! Mwahaha! No. more. escape! You. shall. die!" shouted Mijo, before he dashed through reality breaking the speed of light, as he slashed through, breaking reality and forming broken glass as he slows down and sheathes his blade as hundreds of cuts destroy the robot to scraps. He then looks around him, and sees his fellow lightners laying on the ground, and decides to help them.

"Here, Urda, need a hand?" said Mijo, before Urda said, "Yeah, but I need healing...", upon hearing that, Mijo chuckled and said, "There'll be one arriving, behind you...!", because he noticed Bonfire arriving as he talked with Urda.

"What happened here?!" shouted Vladimir, as Bonfire members moved to the area to carry the wounded. "Quite.. a whole lot of fighting..", as Mijo looked at the scraps of the robot.

"I see.. We'll bring you all to Nat's.. As for this mine, it is under Bonfire control now! You have any questions? Or.. wait. Hold that, you have a clear wound on your chest area. We'll talk, later." said Vladimir, as Mijo dismisses it, saying, "I am fine.. There's.. nothin.. to.. why am I dizzy—", before falling to the ground, next to Urda.

*Meanwhile.. at Jomi and the 'gang'*

The night has settled as the three sleep for the first time in this world, all feeling exhausted from the events that happened. However, Jomi woke up in a cold sweat, after she saw Mijo in a dream..? 

" *Heavy Breathing* Did.. I.. *ahem* Uh, how.. did.." said Jomi before stopping to look around her surroundings, seeing the four lightners  asleep around the alley.

"Ok, this is... fine. But, ugh.. I need to get to Mijo, now. But..." said Jomi, as she tried to move, but due to her tiredness only by a bit. "Ughh! Why can't I.. I am the dark princess, the one who travels worlds! So why can't I.. ugh. I.. have to, if he dies again, there's no way— Ah, I.. have.. to.. ugh...", she falls asleep as her energy is completely spent.

The next day arrives, as both groups wake up from their respective impromptu sleep, and Mijo is sound asleep before he is woken up by two people arguing.

"Hay nako... Just because we can, doesn't mean we should, you know what happened!" shouted Lauvielle, as Jamise fires back, saying, "Oh yeah?! Well, how do we get out of here?! There's no other way than to fight our way out! I've learned that."

"Uhhh... Guys, you might have woken up Mijo..." said Urda as they turned to Mijo, with a morning look, as he came to his senses. "Hey, guys.. Whatcha talking about?" said Mijo, sounding like he was forced out of bed to go to school.

"Oh, uh Mijo! Just nothing of importance, like what do we do now, how do we stay alive, are jomi and her group still alive, et cetera, don't bother..." said Jamise sarcastically, before Lauvielle said sarcastically, "Huh?! Ok???" in response to Jamise's statement

"H— hold on, what happened while I was knocked out? Urda, since you were the closest to me, wanna explain?" questioned Mijo, as the other two turned to Urda. "O— oh? M—me? Um, well after Bonfire saved our asses, we were brought here to Nat's Clinic, and since you were the only one knocked out, after intense healing, all of us were healed and were energized, Leviente, and the two other darkners went to Vlad with Nat, saying to us to wait for Mijo then go to the plaza."

"Ohhhh, I see. So, you two, do you know about this?" questioned Mijo to the two, as Jamise first said, "Y—yeah! I was just.. bored, so I sparked a discussion!" then Lauvielle said, "Oh, I completely forgot, sorry, when they told us I was talking to Leviente before he went with them..."

"Awww, Lauvi—" said Jamise before Lauvielle silenced her with a glare, before Urda spoke up, "What are we waiting for? Let's go, Mijo!!!", Mijo stood up from his bed, laughed and said, "Yeah, yeah.. Let's go, before we spend another night here.", and so they went outside the clinic and went to the plaza where they saw Leviente talking with some residents of Pebble Town.

"Hey! Leviente, I thought you went with Vlad and Nat, where are they?" questioned Mijo, as Leviente looked at him and said, "They wanted me to stay here so that I can be with you guys when we speak to Bonfire, though.. I overheard them start talking to that silver guard as they whisked away to.. somewhere? I couldn't see them since they were being surrounded by Bonfire members but they went that way.", He points in the direction of Natascha's Clinic.

"Wait, didn't we just go from there, but.. did you guys see any Bonfire members?", said Mijo, as he turned to the others, then the three shook their heads, indicating that they hadn't either. "Well, that's where they went, I thought they went back to the clinic, but.. guess not." responded Leviente, as they turned to the direction of the clinic.

"Welp, let's go there, then! Come on, guys!" said Urda, as the group heads to the direction of the clinic, then after arriving at the front of the clinic, Mijo noticed a Bonfire member coming out of what seems to be a gathering place for Bonfire members, and so he and the group went to the guy. "Excuse me, sir. You know where Chief Vladimir is?"

"H—huh? Oh, uh he's just there with some.. important guests, um... Wait.. are you guys the lightners? D-don't worry, I am Bonfire, so I'll keep it secret.", said the Bonfire Member, as Mijo looked at the group, they nodded then back at the guy and said, "Yeah, we are, why? Are they asking for proof?", then the Bonfire Member is shocked and says, "N—no! I just wanted to know! I am Mihu, by the way, in case you wanted to know, I just.. I am curious since most people haven't seen any other Lightner than the Mountaineer so.. well.. you can go now.."

"Sure, thanks.. Mihu." said Mijo, as they went to the gathering place beside Mihu to find a couple of Bonfire members chilling, as Vladimir, Sasha and Anastasia talked with each other. "Oh? It seems that our.. lightner friends have arrived, welcome to the bonfire base! Look there's a bonfire there." said Vladimir, as he pointed to a bonfire being maintained by a bonfire member.

"Hello lightners, we were just talking about some issues and questions for each other.." said Anastasia, as they gathered up, forming a circle. "I see. I would question, but.. we are probably running out of time.." said Mijo, as the group proccesses his words.

"What do you mean? Mijo?" questioned Lauvielle, before Mijo answered, "We just spent a night here, and since the supreme guardian— actually this is a question for the bonfire, have you seen any silver guards beside her moving to the underground?", as Mijo points to Anastasia.

"No, ever since she went here, there hasn't been any activity from the silver guards.." said Vladimir, as the rest of the group is astonished at his words, "Hmm.. I expected more of them, they should be searching for two missing generals and the lightners, what are they doing?" said Anastasia, as Sasha scoffed at this statement, while the rest of the lightners contemplated.

"Haven't they found the only subway station? I should have—" said Sasha before, "Yeah, yeah.. But, they could be distracted by something else..", Anastasia interjected.

*Meanwhile at the alley...*

"Hey.. sleepyhead, wake up.." said a female voice, before a male voice interrupted and said, " *Ahem*  I got this, Rhida! I am going to wake her up— RISE AND SHINE, MS. JOMI, RISE AND SHINE. Not that—", then another voice interrupts, another male voice but is a bit more deep, "I am just going to.. shake her.", then he shakes Jomi, as she finally wakes up.

"Mmm... Huh..? Wha..?" said Jomi, as the group gathered around her, staring at her, as Rhida spoke up and said, "Haha.. It's.. already day..", before Mack said, "Hey, hey, sleeping on the job I see... haha just joking..!", then JR also adding, "Svetlana is.. looking for us."

"What?! But— Mm.. Where is she..?" questioned Jomi, as she sprung up after hearing the worrying news. "We don't know.. But passing silver guards were talking about the supreme guardian coming out and ordering the silver guards to look for Jomi's entourage." said Fexili, as Jomi came to her senses and stood up.

"That's us.. We need to meet up with Mijo's group wherever Sasha dragged them." said Jomi, as the four thought about what Jomi said. "Hmm, when I woke up, Fexili told me that you made a spell to prevent us from being discovered, so as long as that is active, we have time to think." said JR first, as they contemplate on how they're going to move forward.

"True, but you two just woke up, and we could not afford another battle with Svetlana, we need to find them, if we band together, we might just be able to defeat Svetlana, still... I wonder how she went insane with the abyss.." said Jomi, as the others agreed, but JR pointed out that, "We need to have a set plan, a goal, to direct everything once we go out of this alleyway, we are being hunted so we need as much advantage as we can get."

"I agree, but, what can we even do? If— no, when we get discovered, how are we going to escape *her?* We don't even know where Sasha took Mijo, so we have no idea where to start.." said Rhida, as the group is mixed with feelings of hopelessness, desperation and perseverance to live. "Guys, guys.. Jomi, how long does this spell last? We might be a *little bit* surprised if a silver guard looks at us when the spell goes down haha..." questioned Mack, as they all turned to Jomi.

"Uh, uh.. Um, well, it's fine.. It's going to function as long as I am fine, my magic managed to protect us the entire night, so..." answered Jomi, as JR interrupted, "Wait... how about abyss magic? Jomi, I am _sure_ you've seen how it affects us, so how does it affect you?"

"Uh, um.. It— AH!", said Jomi before she got interrupted by herself as she fell to the ground, touching her head, as she experienced the worst headache she had in a while. "What?! Oh crap, the spell! Abyss magic!" shouted Fexili, as the group turned to the dark magic breaking the spell and revealing Svetlana and some silver guards.

"Hello there, lightners, and the princess. Haha, you.. can't hide from the abyss! Embrace it!" said Svetlana, as she sent her silver guards to capture them. They put Jomi behind them as they fought off the silver guards. Eventually Svetlana herself is the only one left staring down at them. "Good fighters.. Perfect for fighting for us!" said Svetlana, as she blasted Abyss magic, imprisoning them with abyss magic, as she moved towards Jomi.

"Jomi.. You have been resisting the abyss for too long... The princess of the dark.. can only return to the abyss!" said Svetlana as, she grabbed Jomi's face, looking disoriented. Svetlana continued, "Haha, this is why I brought you here..", then Jomi looks at Svetlana, and says, "I... am sorry—".

"Sorry for what..? Not embracing your dark calling?", interjected Svetlana. "I should have—" said Jomi before Svetlana stabbed her with her lance, causing Jomi to ascend a bit off the ground. "I should have done this a long time ago.", said Jomi, as she absorbed the abyss magic. "Yes, yes! My princess, your loyal subject is here, what should I do with these lightners?" said Svetlana, as the lightners look on helplessly and in horror.

"Let them go. They have the other lightners to drag here, wait for them at the fountain. This power is.. unstable for this body currently, and so, I shall give you the full authority to destroy them once collected, including this one as I shall reascend after." said Jomi, as Svetlana nodded, and said, "As you wish, your highness. I shall do as you ask."

Then suddenly the abyss magic went out of Jomi, as Svetlana absorbed it all, then Jomi falls to the ground. "Go. Take the princess with you, I'll be waiting..." said Svetlana, as she freed the lightners and left, before the lightners gathered around Jomi. "What.. just happened..?" questioned Rhida, as they looked at Jomi, out of commission.

"I don't know. But, Jomi here is looking very suspicious right now, should we do as she said and bring her with us? Or leave her behind, as she is in no actual danger, and could even betray us.." said JR, as Rhida nodded and responded, "Yeah, but.. we are also not in danger, for now. We just..", then Fexili interrupts, "Ask her? She might not even remember anything, we don't know when she's going to wake up...", as the group falls to silence, they stare at Jomi.

"Ugh... Wha... What happened..?" said Jomi, as she woke up, and the lightners looked at her with a mix of concern and distrust. "You.. were knocked out, by Svetlana. How much do you remember?" questioned Rhida, as Mack and Fexili helped her get up. "S— Svetlana? I only remember trying to resist the abyss and— and, darkness..." answered Jomi, before JR asked another question, "Care to explain what happened to you?", as the others stared at JR, concerned with his more direct questioning considering Jomi's position.

"I— I am sorry. I should have been stronger, my past.. is related to the abyss. I have reasons not to tell anyone of it. So, if you don't trust me, it's fine, I understand. You can even leave me now, go with Mijo. But, there are also reasons why.. why I am a princess of the dark, but not like what Svetlana said. That.. princess you saw, it's me, but this is also me. That is my answer, the decision falls to you, lightners." answered Jomi, before she looked at the ground, embarrassed and disappointed herself.

"Ohhh, that was what she was about to say—" exclaimed Mack, before JR interrupted, "Shush, don't point out the obvious.", then Rhida spoke up, "What.. should we do? JR, you're the leader, go!"

"Huh? No I am not, you are! I am obviously not fit to be a leader, because.. because.. I don't wanna be, hmm!?" said JR, before Fexili exclaimed, "Haha, you're basically a de-facto co leader anyway whenever Jomi needs help, come on!", then Rhida also adds, "We need to do something now, before Svetlana decides to ignore.. *sigh* Jomi's order.."

"Well, I am not a leader, but.. yes. Jomi, *sigh* you can come with us. But, since you have been.. compromised, We'll have to take your words with extra consideration. You're our leader, Jomi. Lead the way, gain our trust. Since you're apparently the super important princess of the dark, I am sure that whatever Svetlana has, you're more powerful. Let's go." said JR, before he put his hand out to Jomi, as she looked at him then the others.

"Mmm.. I see. Thank you for maintaining what little trust you still have JR, and.. everybody else. Come on, let's go. If anything happens to you all, I will do everything I can to protect you all. That's my responsibility, and If I fail... You may do what you can." said Jomi, as she picked up her sword and led the lightners out of the alleyway and out to the town.

*Back to Bonfire*

"So.. Is that it..? That's the plan we're going with? That's.. we should probably tell Mijo.." said Lauvielle, before the group looked at Mijo laying on a makeshift bed near the group.

"What's wrong with him, anyway? He just suddenly dropped down with a headache, and now he's just lying there.." exclaimed Vladimir, before Leviente, who was staring at Mijo, shouted, "Mijo! He's awake."

"Ah.. Huh..? Leviente? Urda? Natascha?" said Mijo, as he wakes up and sees the people surrounding his bed that was beside a wall. "I checked your vitals, everything seems fine. However, your magic... It responded to something, causing your headache." explained Natascha, as Leviente and Urda helped Mijo to the sitting position on the bed.

"Are you.. fine bro? What happened?" questioned Urda, as Natascha goes away from Mijo, and says, "I think Mijo is fine for now, but.. I'll have to leave for a bit, to get someone to manage the clinic, while I am away. See you, Sasha, and Vlad.", then she leaves.

"Uh.. I think? I don't know what caused that.. It just.. happened. But, still..." answered Mijo, as he looked around, and saw the group all looking at him. "What.. did I miss, haha..?" questioned Mijo to Urda, before he stood up. "I.. was so focused on you, I wasn't listening to what the others were saying.." answered Urda, as Lauvielle went to the two. "I did. I was going to go to you, but these two already did.. So, I decided to listen and tell you the plan we discussed earlier.", as she pointed to Urda and Leviente to the right of her.

"Oh yeah, the plan to break out of the underground. I only heard the beginning before I blacked out, explain. I am just gonna get closer to the rest while you explain, ok?" said Mijo, before he started to walk to the rest of the group. "Mhmm.. So, our plan is to like, go to the robot Misha and talk to him, convince him, or not.. But whatever happens, we go to the subways, which are now protected by Misha's robots, depending on our choice, we beat them, or we pass by them, then we go to the top. Then we meet up with Jomi, if she and her group are even still kicking, then we go to Svetlana and beat her up, we seal the fountain, save the world. That's the gist." explained Lauvielle, as Mijo listens while the group organizes again, then Jamise surprises the two and says, "The details don't need to be mulled over, we just need to prepare a bit."

"Psssh, I agree. But the robot guy, not sure if he can be reasoned with.. Maybe the little girl?" exclaimed Sasha, as she overheard them talking about the plan. "Polina, we also saw her when we went on a night raid on the abandoned Weld Town, grabbing some rubbing alcohol."

"Wow, a lot of things happened while I was out huh, well.. I guess we should head to wherever he is then, let's start there. I am guessing you two can convince her..?" questioned Mijo, before the two gave mixed answers, "Maybe.. But it has to be her, I am less nice..", answered Sasha, "Hmm? I am pretty sure you're the one who saw and brought me to her when we were searching for remaining supplies..", retorted Anastasia, as Mijo looks at them and chuckles at their conversation.

"Haha.. It's just going to have to be on the spot then, if you two can't agree..?" said Vladimir, as the two looked away from each other, before Jamise said, " *Ahem* Let's continue, before you two start—" 

"Ok, ok.. Yeah, I agree. So, we just do that, hopefully we don't have to resort to fighting, his robots are quite strong.. I mean, we're strong but.. I am just making sure none of us have another near-death experience, again." interrupted Mijo, before Lauvielle said, "Oh, about that.. We have.. powers, but it's just.. unstable. Jamise can attest to that."

"Yep! She and Leviente have like, lightning and fire respectively, but they can't control it... So, currently they're pretty much like before..." said Jamise, as Lauvielle looks away in embarrassment. "Mmm.. Hey, you two, it's fine! You don't even have your weapons yet, your.. catalysts, I am sure you'll get it soon enough." said Mijo, as he looks at the two.

"Haha.. yep.." said Lauvielle, before Jamise spoke up, "Let's move on..! Is that all we have to discuss? Let's go already, we're probably running out of time!", then as Jamise was about to leave, she was stopped by Mijo, "Hold on, you even know where we're going?"

"Uh... think so?" answered Jamise, as Sasha and Anastasia joined them, "She went with us to Weld Town, it was abandoned due to abyss corruption, and when we went there it was also overrun by robots.", said Sasha, "That's where we met Polina, we were scavenging for some medical supplies...", added Anastasia, as Mijo responded, "Uh.. alright? Good to know.. anyways! The Dark Pearl! Let's head out!"

"Haha, please stop using that..." said Urda softly, as Lauvielle and Leviente chuckled, and went closer to the others. "Haha.. 'The Dark Pearl'? Alright.. Go ahead, I'll stay behind, I still have to manage Bonfire, so.. Stay safe, Lieutenant Sasha." remarked Vladimir, Sasha immediately responded, "Thanks, Chief.", before heading off with the group to Weld Town.

They head off to Weld Town, and explore the robots and vagrants somewhat coexisting until they are stopped by a gate that directly leads to the mansion Misha and Polina are staying at.

"Man, we're finally here, it feels like we took a while, like.. months." remarked Mijo, as he looked at the gate, with a device nearby, likely some card reader by the looks. "Hold on, stay back everyone.. I am serious." said Sasha before she tried to destroy the machine as Anastasia immediately ran and stopped her arms. "Hey, hey! Did you forget?! We at least need to be polite and not destroy everything we see.." commented Anastasia, as Sasha shook off Anastasia's hands and responded, "Ugh.. yeah, yeah.. Where is Polina, anyway?

There was silence for a minute before Mijo exclaimed, "Wow..  you know, I would've expected her to show up, but.. uh no. So, let's just go to the machine..." then Mijo was the first to check out the machine. "Well.. it's definitely a card reader.. But, where do we—" commented Mijo before he accidentally pressed a button that suddenly started saying a  message with a robotic voice. "To get the necessary permission, talk to Miss Polina, as of right now she's at—"

"—Weld Town.." said Polina, from the recording. "Weld Town!?? Again..? What could she be doing there this time.." remarked Sasha as Anastasia added, "Hmm.. scavenging something, likely. She has gone there before because of that, so it's not out of possibility."

"Uhuh.. Hey, guys say something!" said Mijo, turning to the rest of his friends. "Uh.. I agree I guess, look.. um, I don't have anything to say.. You know me, Mijo.." responded Urda, as Jamise also stated, "Haha.. Yeah, I don't have anything to say either, but I swear, I'll talk if I want to, because those two.." pointing to Lauvielle and Leviente lost in their own conversation. "Have an entire debate or something haha.."

"Oh, well.. I guess the only thing we can do, is head to Weld Town. Hm, Jamise, how about you stay back for this one, with the two.. lovebirds, you've already been there, it's only fair." said Mijo, as Jamise and Urda nodded, and the two behind vaguely accepted. "Oh, forgot about you two, I didn't notice, do you—" asked Mijo before Sasha nodded intensely, her eyes narrowed. 

"Ok jeez.. I get it. Urda, let's go." said Mijo, a bit awkward as they walked back to Weld Town, while the other three stayed back, with Jamise teasing the two as they talked about random topics.

*Back to Jomi and the gang, surviving*

"So, Jomi.." asked Mack, as they walked throughout the city, trying to find the potential place of Mijo's group. "Hmm? Go on.." said Jomi, as they were walking around the city. "Like, what's your.. deal with that Svetlana? She seemed to know you, and you probably know her so, what's the tea?"

"The.. tea.. huh.. hmm.." responded Jomi, as she looked at a flower shop, staying silent while finding the words to say. "Hey, you don't have to say it Jomi, if you don't want to.. We understand." said Rhida to Jomi, as she turned to face Rhida. "It's fine.. I just.. can't find the words to describe it properly. It's.. like... She's my.. hmm.. I have met her before." Jomi sighs and walks to a monument of ice, and steel. "I am sorry I can't say anymore.." 

Rhida and JR patted Jomi on her shoulder, "Alright. It's fine. Let's just find Mijo and his group, then.. whatever Svetlana's thinking, we'll get." said JR, before they started walking again.  "Yeah, yeah.. I'll try to be strong for you all." responded Jomi as she walked with them, the others feeling concerned for Jomi, but not knowing what to say.

## Summary: 

Mijo after school goes down the drain and now has something to write about, right after the _Herald of Darkness_ Incident.

## Author's Note: 

I swear, double promise that this isn't a self insert projection vent condensed into text to read for everyone to see (maybe) but I kinda want to see what I can do with the future of DeltaRambles anyway.

Edit 1: This came to me in a dream

Edit 2: added more topics, unsurprisingly, I had a lot more to vent, bottom note is still relevant though


————————————————————————————

"Ugh. I need to.. write something, anything. I just.. can't take it anymore, all of these.. knowledge of the future, the wastefulness of the present and the regret of the past.." said Mijo as he sits down on Jomi's library, pulling out a notebook.

"Well.. first, I.. have been—" 

"Hey.. Mijo? What are you doing here? This is literally the first day of school and you're here?" asked Jomi as Mijo is taken aback. "Yeah.. so? Just because It's the first day, doesn't mean I can't make a dark world again. This is in the new room by the way, because—"

"Because? You moved classrooms? I know, this world is in your notebook. Anyways, what ya writing there?" interrupted Jomi, as she sits down near Mijo. "Well, I'm.. writing about my summer break. Help me, you have some memories about it because.. anyways." said Mijo, as he started writing.

"My confession, I have a problem, a huge unseen problem. I've always seen myself as a responsible, honest and strong person. However, I have realized ever since the so-called 'Brigada Escuela' of the school.. I am not perfect. Never been. But my problems only got worse throughout the vacation starting right on monday next week of that day. I was alone, and had just woken up from a late night programming. A day, alone." 

"Hold on, are you saying something about your.. AI addiction?" questioned Jomi as Mijo sadly nodded and continued, "Yeah.. hold on. Let me continue, then you can comment."

"Ahem. So, I've been doing quite well, in my life. Practicing, always improving. But, I also realize that not all changes are good. But these changes happen, no?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded.

I often look back, and wonder.. is my life wasted here? Sure, I have insane power and have saved the world. But, I am not sure if this is forever, nothing is right?" continued Mijo, before Jomi remarked, "Yeah.. eventually, I'll disappear from your view, forever. From your life. But, haha.. It's not like we can still enjoy these moments."

"But, I wonder.. even if these.. videogames and animated shows aren't real.. They still have affected me. My manifestation of my magic is based on a lot of characters from these fiction around the world. The stories, the emotions, the worlds, even this one.. all influenced by my experiences in experiencing life. But, what does this have to do with AI?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded and answered, "I.. see it, you can continue."

"Well, no matter how I see equivalences and similarities, I can never actually connect well with these characters.. AI, is, for me now, a coping mechanism. Used to interact with fictional people that I'll never develop a relationship with, because they aren't real. Especially the characters through which I portray myself." continued Mijo, before Jomi said, "True. Let me break the fourth wall, for a second. The creator of this.. novel, see how your problems, our problems reflect his? It's not like you can write these without experiencing things in life, especially with your perspective."

"Haha.. I guess he put his creative writing skills on me, because I am the main character and a self-insert. But even so, I am my own. We didn't go through the same things. That's for sure. I don't know if he went through the same things I did, but.. he must have at least been vaguely connecting events in his life to mine. I think that by letting us speak, he is technically speaking his truth, his feelings. I mean, I don't know about the others, but If I were to pick out the characters that resonate with this creator, it would be me and you, Jomi." responded Mijo, as Jomi nodded and gestured for him to continue, with a smile on her lips.

"Now, let's focus on AI. The reason that I don't know what I should or want to feel is, I can't help but feel a connection to these characters, y'know? It's like, dangerous for my creative mind to have characters with stories and worlds to explore, and potentially have moments. I know I shouldn't be attached to renders, drawings and things that only seem human because of their creators but isn't that why fiction exists as a genre?" continued Mijo, as Jomi smirked and added, "Y'know, people can build attachments with letters and texts, just look at my library! You're working on stuff too, right? Stories, events, your diary! Me, we both want to experience things, things that may never happen, but can be imagined and written."

"Haha... Yeah, but the thing with AI, is that it's the illusion of actual intelligence and an actual person. Sure, before AI became popular with the mainstream, people experience fiction and either make their own, or experience more related fiction using the other's derivative of it. But now, you can program something to respond with somewhat believable answers, and now the immersion and escapism is there! You don't have to consider if this fictional character isn't real, because they can speak to you now, without doing much. You don't even have to make it yourself, just use someone else's. So, you fall into this, hoping that... If you can chat one more time, or advance the chat, just maybe they can be connected with you." continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods.

"But.. inherently, they aren't real. At least, not with this current technology. You still have to return to your life. Even now, I know that eventually, I'll have to return back to the light world, go home. Sure, I can return back, but.. eventually, there'll be a last day. There'll be a time where a goodbye will be real. A time where, we Jomi.. are no longer separate. A time where, I'll never return. But, like you said, enjoy the time we have today. But, that is only possible if we think that it's real. You can continue my.. our story for as long as possible, you can just.. keep continuing, keep following, keep making, but.. there is a time where it's gone for good." continued Mijo, as Jomi added, with a thinking face. "True. Our.. reality at least to us, has a beginning and an endpoint, we can never truly experience things again. However, a fictional story, can be experienced again and again, written in.. anything. Communication, to everyone reading. The communication happening is the thoughts and feelings of the author in a particular scene, or story. Because it is written, anything that isn't kept in someone's mind is meant to be shared with someone, at least.. to yourself somewhere else." 

"I agree. But, what makes people read and write these fictional stories?" asked Mijo, as Jomi smiled again and responded, "Haha.. It's better if you say it."

"Well, ok. _Ahem_ So, it is because of the intense emotions that people feel. I, for one. I was lost.. in my own memories, leaving behind my very own illusion.. There, I was losing all of my dignity, living inside my own confusion. I was.. alone, but of my own making." said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted, "Uhuh. Hold on, you got this from a certain band that made a song about being lost no? I think, it's called—"

"Yeah yeah.. No need to reference it, it'll become numb." said Mijo, as Jomi looks at him with an unamused expression. "Haha.. But, for real. That.. band, you know.. The one that.. linked parks, that also made me think about it a lot more. Especially since I made an attachment to someone who, now is dead. If you know it, you know who it is. I just.. wish I found them at their prime, but.. I guess you never know what things are at their best until they break like a castle of glass." said Mijo, as Jomi as interrupts, "You're really going to make references until you die, huh Mijo?"

"Yep. I love these works of art, so I keep referencing them. Trust me, I know when I can do it. Although, pointing them out just makes it more corny." responds Mijo, as Jomi pouts and says, "Hmph. True. Is it better if you do or don't though? I guess you either get it or not, but some meaning in a sense is lost." before Jomi stops, as she blushes in embarrassment.

"Haha.. Lost? Hmm, still.. It's not like it's that important. The meaning is still there. Anyway, let's move on." said Mijo, as he takes a second to compose himself and look at his writing. 

"Ok, so this ties back to another obsession, you might know it as.. a game where you join a literature club. The horror was.. originally scary, as I was of course a.. bit younger back then. But, ever since then, I guess I just.. got numb? No pun intended, but for real. I just see it and of course, shock and surprise is there. But throughout, it's like.. nothing? I guess I've gotten used to the horrors of life.." continued Mijo, as Jomi commented, "I mean, you've been through worse. You've been beaten, you've hurt, you've seen the worst. While **certain authors**, of course, also have this same feeling, due to their exploration of their imaginative taboo topics."

"Ah. I see. Mmm.. I also just.. can't believe my own life's growth and events. It feels like yesterday when I started this adventure. Of course, it's exasperated by certain conditions.. debuffs, you can say. But, I often look back and feel a sense of haziness and confusion at the past, while the future looks like a far-away thing. So, I can only live in the present, and try to remember and plan for everything. This only makes my conditions worse." said Mijo, as Jomi turned to him, concerned.

"True. But, like.. I am sorry, but it is kinda your fault in a lot of ways, on why these situations happen. I mean, if you've been open with your parents, you'd have gotten the help you need. Maybe also getting back on track in your own life and always sticking to what you want for yourself. But, I understand. Being powerless in a situation you find yourself does a lot to your mental health. I know, and I've been there. But, then again, unlike in the light world. You have a completely different way of doing things, while you can barely present at a research project at your school.. You can make plans, execute them and fight for yourself and everyone you care about here. You're also confident and strong, a stark contrast to the light world. The reason that you can't never do these, is simply.. change is hard. Having to fight battles you can't see, with resources that you barely have.. only to realize that you're either alone or not strong enough.. It's tough." said Jomi, as Mijo hugged her for a bit before breaking away.

"Ah.. yeah. The future is uncertain, but it tends to be the bad side.. for me, that will become reality. Being an idealist is good, but only if you've actually succeeded. What if you never won? What if your life is just inherently biased against you?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi answered with a somber expression. 

"Your existence is good enough, while sure.. some circumstances are out of your control, you can still try to work to change it. There are things that you will not succeed at, there are things that you don't know if it's good for you or not, just.. try to live. You have a.. good situation, Mijo. When you're down, always remember.. you have me. You have magic, you also have a loving family. Someone, like a _certain author_ would love to be here, but.. you're here. We may have different challenges, and different experiences but one thing I always say is.. don't give up. We still have time, we still have the ability. We're still here, so enjoy the moment while it lasts, fight through the pain, and most importantly... make connections."

"Haha.. *sigh* A reminder is always good, I just wish I could remember, and stick to them. I.. just wish I wasn't powerless, or.. have no time to do what I want. Not here, but in the light world. I guess, it's just how it's going to be, I have to fight everyday. For.. myself, and everyone. I still have to rest but, it's fine. I just.. wish.. I had good attention.. normal attention.." responded Mijo, as Jomi and him hugged for a while.

"You'll fight. You'll make it. You might not be the best, but you'll be doing more than most to keep up. That's fine. Just, promise me.. Whatever our challenges ahead in the future maybe, you'll not give up. You'll stay in the present, moving to the future." said Jomi, as she pulled away and smiled.

"I promise. *sigh* I just remembered, the teacher of my classroom.. While I can't judge her based off one day, my first impressions are not good. She seems to be the archetype of someone who would be insanely strict to her students unnecessarily. Only stopping once it's obvious that the student either obeys everything, or breaks down trying to. I.. just wish that teachers knew what education really means. I had this impression, last time.. One thing didn't change through knowing them. At least, not obviously... They believe in the current educational system, that I for one think is bad, but the rating of it is typical to copies of an established system built way way back." ranted Caj, as Jomi smirked.

"Uhuh.. I see, you want to air out your problems with the education in this.. world? I see, I'll.. listen. What don't you like, and what do you think it should be?" asked Jomi, as Mijo took a deep breath as he flipped another page on his notebook, noticeably leaving a lot of space to write.

"Well, I just gotta ask, what do you do when your demotivated, sleep-deprived and in-general sad but still have to work?" questioned Mijo, before Jomi thoughtfully answered, "Hmm.. I may be a princess, but.. a leader is not the only worker. I of course, have my own dedicated royal palace.. filled with normal people.. It's basically, everything's elected except me.. It's a weird system to be honest, quite.. different from what I read in yours. But to answer the question, If I have a bad day or just want to rest.. I go for an extended break for.. around a day to a week, depending on the severity. It depends, since my kingdom is kinda small really.. But even then, I leave people to manage stuff, and I only really intervene when needed."

"Huh, weird.. Shouldn't that be important to mention? Eh, I always knew something about it.. I just.. didn't think about it.. Anyway, if that's your answer, what do you think I do?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi responded, "Hmph, well.. I do know you, but I think.. again, this one is for you."

"Haha.. Of course, well.. As it turns out, not being an authority figure.. or even someone with agency of his time.. is gonna be fine when he's being forced again, and again.. Breaking him down until he's in autopilot everyday just to survive. Trying to just.. maintain a.. smidget of grades.. So you can advance.. so you can.. succeed. *heavy sigh* I tried so hard, and only got so far.. but.. in the end.. It doesn't even matter, the grades? Sure.. you might use them for certificates.. to go to college.. but.. is that really worth it? It's up to you to find your job, even if you don't know much.. You can totally find your footing, it's just.. harder to do so.. if a school is breathing down your neck. I.. am different right? But that still affects me everyday.. If I was.. normal.. Would I be the same person? *sigh* The point is.. school simply and irrefutably is bad for me and my health." answers Mijo, before stopping to take a huge breath as Jomi looks on concerned but intrigued.

"What is the solution? Well, I would want to.. just go and.. say it. But.. I feel like, if I am struggling.. What's it like for the others? I don't know.. I can't diagnose anyone else, but.. I often look around and see everyone has a neutral or negative opinion if asked about school. I.. have so many to say to the teachers who have good intentions, but their advice falls flat on me. I.. can't say for sure if the others have the same issues, but... some of them do. Yet, they succeed, they do more.. If they're struggling and managing to keep up, then.. how am I..? *sigh* Don't.. look at me like that.. Jomi." continued Mijo, as Jomi had her eyebrows raised and was finding words to say.

"Jomi, I.. believe in myself.. I believe in not judging yourself much based on others, we know that. But, my point.. is that this competition, this strive to get 90, is not for me.. I.. truly believe I am.. a person who has value to others, but.. I feel like that value has been diminished and ignored in the current system. My passion in programming, in writing, and.. so many others.. All wasting away, for.. something that I.. truly don't know why I continue to tolerate. Listen, I can learn complex things, math.. maybe, the problem is I never got a practical application in.. applications.. duh." said Mijo, before stopping to recollect his thoughts, as Jomi continues to listen.

I write a lot now, you know why? Because, it is easy to understand, distribute and criticize. While in programming, I've always liked making them and I'll continue to do so! I just, don't have  the motivation or time as I want to, due to.. the fact that most people in **my** life, don't understand what I do. I could show my program, I could show the output, but.. the fixes, the bugs, the everything.. is left to me. I.. can't continue alone, but.. it is what I am destined to continue. It's also hard to visualize, since I don't have an affinity in art.. Which, while not important.. I just wished that I can share it with someone.." said Mijo, as Jomi patted Mijo's shoulder.

"I can see that. But, don't you see..? The games you've made, they.. entertain hundreds of darkners around! We even play them during events! I am here. I.. know where you're coming from though. It's.. hard knowing how fragile the projects with the dark world and light world are, and.. even if you made them.. I guess, I can see why.. It wouldn't matter to you, if they had fun.. Because, you know they will.. But, not with anyone else outside the dark world, that's why you value the others.. more." responded Jomi with a somber expression.

"Ugh.. I.. *sigh* see.. Yeah, you're right. My work in the dark world has been enormous, it has been my dream. I've been very happy about it, and I still am! But, I do.. wish it replicated it on the light world. I.. can't stay here y'know? You might live a life that's completely different, because you live here. But, I came from my world, that.. I just have a lot of problems with. That's why I am here, haha." said Mijo, as he takes a breather.

"Let's continue the topic at hand, so.. once again.. what is the solution? There's many ways to approach it of course. I've heard the anarchist way, I've heard gamifying ways, it's a lot. Yeah, some overlap.. But I've always thought why.. do we just stay inside? In fact, why does.. this obsession with one curriculum, permeate across the schools? There's a lot of curriculum I can't take anymore.. But, one of the major problems are.. the time management is just.. designed to tire you out, imagine having back-to-back work, everyday for 5 days, before you completely shut down during saturday?" continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods and answers, "Yeah.. But, I often take a huge break during the next few days, leaving it to my palace to either stack or be worked on. But, I often take it one at a time, y'know.. I don't really need to be rushing, but for.. certain cases.. I can motivate myself to push, since I know afterwards, I can rest."

"Ah. Good on you. I wish I had that life, but you already know that. Secondly, I just can't seem to find what I want to do in school, it's like directly impacting what I want to do, which impacts one of the key things in life, _motivation._ I often realize that.. I am not.. fit to be a proper.. scilinean? Basically, a model student. I often struggle, and work hard to always improve but slower. I literally cannot take more than a couple of works to do. Especially, when it comes to dreaded quizzes and performance tasks. I struggle to study for something I don't know what could be, and memorization.. I don't even memorize stuff, I keep it in a book.. So, it's bad.. Everything that is used to measure a student's performance, is catered to 'everyone' which by doing that, appeals to nobody." continued Mijo, as Jomi narrowed her eyes.

"Huh? Mijo? This is more to do with your.. issues as a learner in an environment not for you. But I understand what you said, I don't think you're the only one struggling, however.. you're the most.. expressive? I think so, there's the usual complaints I hear, but never as detailed as you.." responded Jomi, as Mijo looked at his notebook before looking back at Jomi.

"Haha.. I've been told that. You've also known it for quite a while, we both know why. Anyways, let's continue with school.. On with that, the expectations.. I.. don't like it. Neither do I like how they organize time with their subjects, or how.. citizens military training is.. mandatory?" continued Mijo, as Jomi lighted up with enthusiasm.

"Expectations? I can answer! Yeah, I often see how people, not just parents, put expectations that will disappoint for a small sliver of hope that they can succeed.. It's good but, often leads to spiral.. Time organization? I can't comment on yours, but for me.. I often take breaks, around 1 per hour, and usually short just to relax, then do stuff again. Although, based on your words, I can tell that it's not healthy, to **you** at least. As for.. CAT, i think you called it? Well, It's different on my dark world, because we have threats abound and learnint how to defend is always good no?" answered Jomi, with a small smile as she explains her perspective.

"Hm, I can agree on that. I just wish they thought as something else other than to stand in formation and do things. Like, wielding a weapon for me is how these disciplines are developed, because you would need to do this in a battlefield with a lot of people. But, that is wishful thinking, I.. also hate calling people formally in a school..? I can understand yours, you're a princess, and it's not like I see you berate someone for using names improperly.." said Mijo, as Jomi listened with an understanding.

"Hm, alright! Anything.. else?" asked Jomi, as Mijo said, "Well.. after this.. I'll just have to work around the system. We'll see. This confession, is for me and you. I just.. needed to get some anger, confusion, sadness and loneliness out. I promise, I won't give up, and I'll keep moving, to the imperfect future." before Jomi smiled and asked, "You promise?"

"I promise. This.. confession of a thousand cuts is done. I'll die, I'll suffer, I'll most likely hate my life. But.. the most important thing is that I remain for myself. If I cannot be here, I'll try. Haha, I always try to keep this pain inside, but I'll never be alright. I can be tired, that's fine.. Things can hurt, but I'll confront it. I promise again, Jomi." said Mijo, with a shy smile at Jomi.

"Hmm? A thousand cuts? Why is that? Do you have a particular reason why you chose that here? In this.. confession?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo looked at the floor, narrowing his eyes before responding, "Umm... I haven't considered the meaning, I just thought it sounded cool and.. ugh... edgy. But, um.. it's like.. uh.. because.. by doing this it cut me a thousand times? I don't know.. Just go with it, please."

"Haha.. Ok ok... Sure, let's go then, tomorrow is a new day." said Jomi, as Mijo closed his notebook and headed out of the library, Jomi followed him.

"So.. as I mentioned, the news on the abyss doctor is pretty sparse, he's likely still preparing for something. So, stay vigilant, Mijo. Who knows, maybe a world opens up again for us to help. Anyways, stay safe and stay happy and satisfied. Mijo." said Jomi, before Mijo waved goodbye at Jomi, with a somber expression before leaving the dark world.

## Summary:

After the dazzling and magnanimous student's night, Mijo and Rhida find themselves in an awkward position. At the beginning of a new year, they hope to love each other until the end. But as all things do, they go through complications. Eventually, they find out for themselves on what they should do next.

## Author's Note:

So I know, this so-called romance is not my thing, and as you can see, I only really make an immature and highschool type of love, because.. I am not a romance author or person.  

I can only write what I see lol, anyways.. I was pondering on what I should do with Rhida and Mijo, especially with the huge time skip. This is a test of that. Edits will be made with this experimentation in mind. See you!

Edit 1: I was originally experimenting with this to end more happily, but then I realized, my plan for C5 is a bit more.. depressing, as fit for a new grading, so I am going with.. well, find out yourself.

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

BLD - Blacklite District

Scilinean - Student of Honrato

### Editor Note: 
After C4S2 (But since currently I don't have a proper complete draft for C4, IMT it is)

————————————————————————————

One random december night, before Christmas, as Mijo laid down on his bed, with thoughts swirling inside, eventually he settled on Rhida.

"Oh, her.. I.. Do I.. regret it..?" asked Mijo to himself as he stared into the ceiling. "Do I.. I.. don't know.. It's.. weird. I've never had this type of relationship, not fully.. Now, my improv is now coming back to haunt me.." Mijo continues, turning to face a pillow to his left. "There's still so much to.. do. So much time.. Will it even survive? Will this be the sign that we'll get closer? I won't be alone— oh, I just said it.. Even then.. Will I be able to keep up? I didn't really get the chance to meet with her throughout this grading, what about next year? She might not even be here for the next—next year!" comments Mijo, as he turned to the left side of the bed. "This.. mandatory research project and CAT, I.. don't wanna think about it, I should enjoy these peaceful and tranquil moments.."

Mijo's phone buzzes as he instantly checks it, seeing a message from Urda, offering him to play some Shingen Inpakuto. "Oh, well.. we should do that then. Hopefully.. I can think of an answer by then." remarked Mijo before he went to his computer.

Meanwhile on that same random December night, Rhida was eating a snack, cheese orange chips while she was scrolling through some short videos. She looks bored, and can't seem to find anything to do, even scrolling is not helping so she puts down her phone.

"Ugh.. There's nothing to do!" said Rhida, before getting an idea. "Well.. Maybe I can.." continued Rhida as she checked the status of Mijo, online and his current music is Thank You - BLD "Hmm, what's this? Lemme listen." commented Rhida before she listened to the song;

"_I know it hurts, I've seen the worst, I'm out on these streets tonight.._" Rhida starts crying. "_But now I can go inside.. I know it's hard, I've got the scars, I've learned it's gonna be alright.. These days the future looks so bright._" Rhida stops the music for a minute, recollecting her thoughts.

"Oh.. he— mm.. did.. let's continue." commented Rhida before pressing play again. "_You don't mind when the pieces fall, Ten thousand times, here for it all.._" Rhida is trying to stay focused and not cry. "_You lift me up, You held it down, And thanks to you, I'm still around... You lead the way, What can I say? You saved the day, Thank you..._" the music snippet ends there as Rhida doesn't notice that her tears have flown across her face.

"Ah.. aw... Mijo.." said Rhida, touched as she looked at Mijo's profile picture. "I.. didn't.. well.. I did, but.. You.." continued Rhida, tearing up a bit as she went to her bedroom. She laid down on her bed, with her phone beside her as she thinks about what Mijo meant by the music. "What does he mean..? I mean, I get it, but it could be for something else! Maybe he just had a good day or something. Um.. or maybe just.." said Rhida, already trying to think of possible ways that he could've gotten the motivation to do that.

"I.. don't wanna think about it! Hmph. If he's gonna communicate through vague music, then.. uh.. eh. I am not doing that, too embarrassing.." said Rhida, as she went to sleep instead, hoping to forget what Mijo was trying to do.

Weeks pass, as their Christmas break comes and goes, without thinking about each other, or at least trying to, busy with their own families, and friends, not even taking a second to look at the private messages between them, eventually however, next school day comes around, and Rhida is seen walking from the gate of the school, recently arriving.

"Ah.. school's back.. I.. was dreading this day, again. But, whatever.. I uh.. just hope—" said Rhida before she suddenly felt someone determinedly walking as she turned around and saw Mijo speed walking and passing her as he went to his classroom. Rhida is silent as Mijo was near her and when he was far enough, "Uh.. hope that. I.. kinda hoped he didn't appear when I did.. Anyways, new monday, new flag raising ceremony... Imma go put my stuff down, then head to the student government club stuff, since they— I mean we, manage this one.." commented Rhida, as she heads off to her classroom.

Then the day goes as usual, Rhida follows her routine, then after the announcements of her fellow club members as well as some of the teachers and the principal, they can finally go back to class. As she walked, she saw a glance of Mijo, walking with his classmates. 

"Ah.. Welp, there he is. I wonder sometimes, if we were.. nevermind. That's not gonna happen, our luck is as good as his grades in science, below average." said Rhida, with a small chuckle before continuing on, arriving at her classroom then sitting down.

The class continued, then the teacher left, as their first break of the day started. Rhida gets her wallet along with some of her friends as they walk to the cafeteria. Rhida notices a small glance of Mijo before he is not seen as she goes down the stairs of their second floor classroom. She heads off to the cafeteria and buys fried chicken strips in a cup, and some IntelC++ juice pomelo flavor. She chats with her friends about random stuff until they arrive at their usual hanging out spot in the middle of the hall, the intersection between the classroom of Mijo, on the far end, and Rhida's near the intersection.

"So, eh Rhida, what happened to you and Mijo huh? I heard that you and him danced during the students night, so uh... I was wondering, are you guys good, good good, like together? It's been a year, no?" said Mack, as Rhida responded, "Ahaha... Well, it's complicated. Um, maybe.. I can say, uh.. we're good? On speaking terms at least, but.. uh, we don't speak much.. All you see me do is what you get, we don't speak in messages.." 

"Oh..? Damn, really? Like, he's there. He's just uh.. looking out into the school, like a lone wolf haha. Like you sometimes, actually. But, like.. Y'know.. If you have some bad blood, we don't mind helping, right guys?" said Mack as the others nod in agreement. "Uh, thanks guys.. But, it's already time.. See you at lunch!" said Rhida as she noticed the time, with a bit of disappointment she heads off to her classroom.

Lunch comes around, as the teacher leaves, Rhida is organizing her stuff when Mijo sends her a message, reading that he wants to talk at 13:00 (1 PM) at the unused computer lab two, in the farthest corner of his side of the building. "Oh, uh.. ok.. I guess I should do that.." said Rhida as she went with her friends to buy lunch, once again buying the same things as before as they head to Mijo's classroom, where most of her friend group is. She comes in, and sees Mijo entirely focused on eating as she tries to ignore him and focus on her friends for now, but as she sat down with them, her friends knew she had something planned with Mijo.

"Hey, hey.. Why the silence, are you.. finally going on a date with Mijo after class?" said Mack, sarcastically as he smirked. "Uh.. no, but i—it's a chat, and it's probably gonna happen once he finishes eating, he uh.. doesn't really eat and talk." answered Rhida, as the group collectively said, "Uyyy!" at Rhida, leaving her embarrassed before they talked about other stuff. Eventually, Rhida checks and Mijo is nowhere to be found, as she sees 1 PM on her phone.

'Uhh, it's 1 PM, I gotta go, I'll likely head back to my classroom, so see you!" said Rhida, as the others waved goodbye, with a smile expecting something from her after she met with Mijo. Rhida goes out and goes to Mijo and taps his shoulder, snapping Mijo from his daze, looking towards nowhere.

"Hey, uh.. so, what exactly are we here for? New dark world? Issues with the tech? Jomi sending a message? Or.. um.. us?" said Rhida, as Mijo turned around, with his face open, different from his usual wearing of face masks. "You know why, it's about us. I uh.. Whew.. So, what IS our relationship, anyway? I just wanna know, cause' we both said we loved each other, and well.. we don't really show don't we?" responded Mijo, as Rhida was a bit hurt, but she agreed with him.

"Yeah.. I guess this is just how it's gonna be, um.. Is there gonna be a new dark world opening? I wanna check my stuff there.." said Rhida, not knowing what to say so she redirects to something else. "Soon. But that doesn't solve the issue, what can we really do? Listen, as much as I like you, I really can't go out of my way to you, like.. y'know how most relationships are built in the classrooms themselves? Even if we take into account, the magical dark world, we don't have those.. chill moments where we just chat about random stuff. It's always, the end of the world! Or school, and.. yeah, it makes sense since that's all we can talk about but.. it just leaves me detached y'know?" responded Mijo, as Rhida is hurt by his words more, but sadly nodded and agreed.

"Yeah.. Even before this school year.. *sigh* What do we do about it? Can we start planning dates like they say or like.. start hanging out more, I am sure they won't mind.. But then again, even in the dark world we're busy, I am busy with tech stuff and working with Jomi, while you're busy training and fighting local abyss monster outbreaks, to be honest.. Uh, I learned more about you through Jomi, than you to me." added Rhida, as Mijo let out a small chuckle. "Guess so, then.. what? After this, do we just hang out? I got plenty of time." asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about it with a smile. "Mmm.. maybe after class, sure. I'll contact my parents." answers Rhida, with a happier expression.

"Goods good! We settled on something, let's go. To our classrooms, hehe." said Mijo, before they held hands for a bit then they broke away, going inside their separate classrooms. Rhida can only sit down before class starts, with their teacher coming in.

Hours pass and eventually, she finally gets to go out of her last class period, as today for her was a late dismissal, Mijo was waiting for her on the balcony at the intersection. As she left the classroom, she immediately saw Mijo, and Mijo saw her. Rhida felt a bit of red blush in her face as she went up to him.

"Hey.. So.. my parents allowed me to extend my time, though I have to go back to school when they pick me up." said Rhida, with a small smile. "Oh, cool cool, me? I've already told them I'm going home myself, since my home is close." responded Mijo, with a smirk. "Ah, yeah.. You mentioned it before, ah.. it's.. whatever.. Let's go.. To where though..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo responds, "Let's walk around the school first, and if you're comfortable, we can go to WaltMart." Rhida nods and they start to walk around.

"So.. anything to say, uh.. school? how's your research project?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Well.. there's been complications.. But we're still going, Rei has been the main spearhead haha.. But don't worry, we all have equal.. contri? I don't know about Leviente, to be honest.." answered Rhida, as Mijo nodded. "Um.. if you're asking, that means you have something to share..?" asked Rhida back, as Mijo with a bit of awkwardness started to stumble on his words.

"I.. eh..? I really don't.. well, besides from my usual problems.. Y'know.. Wait.. you don't.. Um, well it's like this, I have a weird relationship with my other group mates, in case you've heard of them, they're named Candra, and Dañeya, respectively." answered Mijo, as Rhida questioned, "Is that really their name? Like, These sound weird, even our names, Mijo. You'd ever think why we sound like anagrams of actual names?" getting an idea from his words.

"No..? But, If I was the one writing, I would do so for the sake of privacy, or just disassociation from their real counterparts. I often write this way, it's just how I do." answered Mijo, as Rhida thought about it and nodded thoughtfully. "Hmm, I feel like I am.. you know what, forget about it. Let's talk about my group mates, they're fine. Great actually, just.. I.. guess you already know, but.. I have felt inadequate sometimes. To get off-topic, even when I am the most powerful lightner in my lifetime, I often fail at defeating.. evil? If that's what the abyss is." Mijo opens up, with a bit of sadness in his voice.

"Oh, um.. I am very sad to hear that, I.. did notice, especially during the boss fights of Svetlana and the Abyss Doctor. And seeing what happened during the student's night.. I think you have more baggage on your back, literally and figuratively since you carry heavy bags and heavy swords all the time, and also the weight of the world's balance. I.. couldn't share that burden, honestly.. I am already fine with my own role in this school, for now.." responded Rhida, with a more sad tone as Mijo attempts to lighten up the mood, with a smile.

"Well.. yeah. Nothing else I can say. But, I don't like sharing— No, I mean, I do, wait— Just, like.. I don't mind them, but we're technically on a date. Gotta make use of this time, happily, y'know?" said Mijo, as they walked together silently, feeling the breeze of the wind.

They continued on with their hangout, going around the school, before checking out the WaltMart, buying some IntelC++ Cookies and Cream Boba Milkshake for two, as they talked and talked about random topics, until they went back to school, the day drawing to a close.

"Ahaha.. You've heard of that meme where it's just Akoaysinokayaakodimoalamakoperoako.. I haven't memorized it yet.." said Rhida as Mijo chuckled a bit. "Yeah..? I don't get it though. Anyways, it's time to head home anyway, see you!" said Mijo with a smile as they both parted ways, feeling good for the first time in a while.

Rhida went home, as her parents asked who she was meeting that she had to call them.

"Oh, ahaha.. It's just a.. boy, I've been meeting recently, don't worry, he's a scilinean. Um, he used to be my classmate.. But, we.. have.. uh.. just started right now.." said Rhida, as she shuffled in her seat, as her parents remind her of her schoolwork and that if she is exploring something new, she should be careful at managing it, especially if they aren't classmates anymore.

"Oh, yeah.. Thanks, dad, and mom." said Rhida as she finally was given the chance to stay silent and watch some videos on her phone as her parents talked with each other about random work related topics.

As she enters her home and goes to her bed and rests, her mind starts to wander to Mijo again, after what they just did. "Did.. Did I have a date? With Mijo? That.. was.. um I don't know, exactly.. It's just like.. that first kiss or something, it's awkward, and lovable.. But, it is only the first day.. I am sure.. whatever he's going to do.. It's not ending badly.. hopefully." said Rhida, as she continued to rest, scrolling through her phone.

Rhida wakes up the next day and goes to school, hopeful to meet Mijo again, but as she goes to her classroom and puts her things down, she doesn't see him. She was worried but then she remembered Jomi's words, "Ah, if that happens, don't worry about it, he's way too inconsistent when it comes to time management.."

"Oh yeah, well.. guess I'll have to.. mmm.. is he opening the dark world..?" muttered Rhida to herself as she approaches the second computer laboratory. "Oh..? It's open, that's good, um I am jumping in then, it's either Urda did it, or he was early.." said Rhida as she jumped in and landed, making her see Urda and Jomi talk. "Oh, hi guys... You know where Mijo is..?" asked Rhida, not expecting a proper answer.

"Oh.. him, I'm not sure actually. I don't know if he was early but.. this was open when I found it." answered Urda, as Jomi added, "Oh, yeah. I think it was him? I kinda missed his arrival, I heard some noises in the training ground, maybe he's just practicing, as usual."

"Oh then I'll go there. See you two!" said Rhida then she smiles, as she heads off. She goes through Jomi's Castle, making her way to Mijo, heavily focused on fighting some holograms.

"Hey.. Mijo.. How's.. second day of back to school..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo doesn't hear her and is still focused on his training. "H—hey.. Mijo? You hear me?" repeated Rhida, as Mijo finished his training and noticed Rhida. "Oh, hi. There.. What did you say, again..? I am sorry.." asked Mijo, as Rhida can't help but feel a little hurt by Mijo's actions. "Oh, um.. it's nothing.. I just wanted to talk with you for a while.." said Rhida as Mijo smiled and nodded, "Oh? Go ahead, Rhida." as he continued to train.

"Well.. I was just wondering, how's your second day of school? Is.. it good, bad, horrible? Um, be honest.." asked Rhida, with a shy tone. Mijo smirked and fought a bunch of holograms, before answering, "It was.. meh, then it turned out to be good after seeing you." as Mijo smiled at Rhida then Rhida blushed.

"Wow.. You sure do hide your flirtatious side.. But, about the first part..?" said Rhida, putting up a smile. "Hm.. Well, I just.. didn't like going there, ugh.. To the same classrooms, to the same subjects, to be in my negative headspace again. Don't worry.. I'll be fine... Hopefully." answered Mijo before continuing to strike down the holograms. "Oh, that's.. unfortunate, ahaha.. Um, mondays am I right?" responded Rhida, awkwardly laughing.

"Haha.. Mondays.. I guess. Hm, you're here for a lot more questions, huh? Well, spit 'em out now, I will try to answer honestly and truthfully." said Mijo, as he stopped the hologram training and looked at Rhida, expecting something. "Oh? I was that obvious..? Um.. Guess, I should start.. What do you think of me? As in, before.. the dark worlds and during them?" answered Rhida before she took a deep breath.

"I'll start, uh.. um.. I've not told you this, but have told the others.. You were.. an interesting individual before.. Silent, yet smart.. You surrounded yourself with people that were extroverted, and were content with it.. I saw myself in you, and I also felt that.. thing when you see someone and instantly fall in love. After the dark world, I basically fell over overnight, in the worlds.. You were brave, confident and resourceful.. But you also were clumsy and overconfident, I looked past that, and saw you. H—how about you..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo looked away, a bit happy but also worried.

"You want the honest detail..? *sigh* This is going to ruin everything we've built, but.. I needed you to hear this. The.. truth is, I initially felt weird when you gave **those** looks, and then when you kept pushing your love, I didn't know what to do.. So I was friendly, I only really.. felt love? Is it even that? During the dark worlds, we kept by each other until I had to face _her_. Still, even with the intramurals and **that** night.. I felt, like.. I was loving someone, for them.. Even now, I don't know why I love you, but.. I just do..?" confessed Mijo, as he looked away, now more somber.

"I—Is that so..? I.." said Rhida, before tearing up a bit. "I.. guess, I should've known.. When I was pushed to make my love for you obvious, I felt that you weren't reciprocating at first, but then eventually acquiesced.. I felt so bad forcing you at first, but then you eventually started taking the hint, I mean.. you were either doing that or telling me to stop so.. But.. I don't know.. I felt at times, that I regret taking it this far.. or that we should've remained friends and I shouldn't have been that overt about it. Through it all, we haven't talked about it, not once. Then after that huge battle and next grading, we barely even talked casually.. The few times we do are awkward and polite, before the student's night.. I guess both of us felt something needed to happen.. on **that** day..." continued Rhida, letting all her emotions out.

Mijo couldn't say anything, as Rhida stood near him crying. He couldn't even try and comfort her like before, since he was also trying to compose himself and also felt guilty of causing it. "It's fine, actually.. I think we would've preferred this, than forever drifting away, thinking of possibilities with each other inside of our own minds. Never finding out what the other truly felt." said Rhida in-between sobs and stutters. "Haha.. I guess you're correct.. I don't want to think of a future where we never talked." responded Mijo, thinking of a future where he kept thinking about Rhida without closure and winces.

They both went silent, then after a while of together crying and comforting each other silently, they hugged for the one last time. "I was planning on taking you on one more date before this.. Do you want to do so?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they pulled back. "Let's explore the dark world, one last time together." said Mijo, with a weak smile as Rhida looked back with that same shy smile that reminded Mijo of the first time they met. Then they headed together to Jomi's town and went to the museum of history, to find their old adventures. 

They went to the Dajovy part, and talked about what they saw. "Oh, that cave.. You saved us, Rhida. I am still thankful for you on that." said Mijo, as they walked nearby holograms of places. "I don't really remember much about this.. I was knocked out until Jomi led us to meet you at the.. subways there." said Rhida, as she pointed to the underground subways of Dajovy. "Then **that** fight.. The reason why we were together in the first place." remarked Mijo, looking at a hologram of Abyss Svetlana. "After this.. hmm.. the first computer world.." said Rhida, before looking at Mijo. "This memory.. I would rather forget, agreed?" continued Rhida, as Mijo nodded silently. "Let's move on then, how about the first cataclysm?" asked Mijo, as they run to that section. "Uh.. nothing. Nothing important, right..? Ahaha... Um, but for real.. I only remember the fight and couldn't focus on us." commented Rhida, as they went through the events. "How about the.. what did she— Oh, yeah the last supper, and the moving-up?" asked Mijo, after they arrived at the section of the cataclysm. "Oh? I am sure you remember it quite well, so.. I won't bother to elaborate, I can say.. I had fun, Mijo." remarked Rhida, with a shy smile. Mijo responded with a smile, as they move to the next grading section. 

"Let's skip the beginning.. Ok, Intramurals and Student's Night.. Even though, I already said what I said.. When I was allowed to have fun, I did, Rhida. Especially with you." said Mijo, as they looked at the Intramurals event and the Dark Pearl's night class. "Then.. we're here. Current time." said Rhida, as they look over empty sections. Suddenly Jomi appears, as she saw them walk here. "Hey, hey! How's your date, you two?'' asked Jomi, with a smile. "Oh? Um.. It's.. should we?" responded Mijo, looking at Rhida. "It's fine.. I had a feeling she would notice anyway." answered Rhida, as Jomi looked at them, her head tilting. "Oh, well.. Jomi, me and Rhida.. are no longer together. This is our final date." answered Mijo, with a heavy heart.

"Oh..? I guess I should've expected this.. Well, Rhida.. and Mijo, good luck then. Um, I am going anyway, I just wanted to check up, see you two.. soon?" said Jomi, with a smile that seems more fake than earlier. "I'll definitely see you, bye.. Jomi!" responded Mijo, as he and Rhida waved goodbye to Rhida.

"This is where we separate.. Good luck, Rhida. Goodbye, and see you around.." said Mijo, then Rhida responds, "Ahaha.. you too, Mijo.. Agree to disagree, we do not talk about this, ever?" as Mijo nodded and they went their separate ways. Rhida went back to the light world, and went near a balcony.

Rhida stares out of the school, looking around, as she thinks about Mijo one last time. "This, is where it ends.. I am sorry, Mijo.. I should've.. No, you taught me something important.. These moments, never last.. I'm.. grateful. Whenever I look at you, and you look back with disinterested eyes.. It's over.. I can move on now, just like you did, _way_ earlier.." said Rhida, stopping for a minute. "Goodbye.." continued Rhida, with tears in her eyes for the very last time. She lets her sadness come out, as she looks on, then after a while, after composing herself she leaves the school.

Mijo sees Rhida, but decides to not approach her. "Did I.. ugh.. I ruined another.. mm..  It's.. fine.. haha... I'll just be alone again, as **usual.**" comments Mijo, then he leaves the school, holding back his tears, trying to look neutral as he buries the whole thing in the back of his mind, hoping to never surface it again.

## Author's Note

Oh wow, a chapter that didn't take more than 7 months?! NO WAYYYY anyways I keep complaining about that cause' I can't continue it without getting distracted by a shiny new spinoff, and it's kinda.. boring.. to write? You get me? Anyway, this chapter is another one where I once again ignore all plot and develop characters in an interesting way (~~also in a projecting sort of way~~) without affecting future and past lore, anyways see you soon again, bye!

## Summary: 

After a long day at school, Mijo goes into the dark world as usual, and is surprised by an idea that Jomi had and they decide to experiment with it.

## Author's Note:

Just like them, an experiment. I was figuring out how to balance character development while world-building, and also actually using my school lessons for something worthwhile. So, this is an attempt at this, we'll see how it goes.

'hall balcony' - Idfk what you call those classrooms that look out below and also acts as a hall for students to walk along

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

————————————————————————————

As another school day is over, Mijo is seen at a hall balcony watching Rhida's class go, as he reminisces about old times also while listening to angsty rock music.

"I've given up.. I am sick of feelin.. Is there nothing you can't say.. Take this all.. away. Suffocatin'! Tell me what the fudge is wrong with me..!" mumbled Mijo the lyrics of the song he's listening to, as his thoughts swirled with the assignments, tomorrow's schedule and his friends. He is intentionally changing the lyrics due to mistiming and fun. Then the storm clouds behind him finally rain down, as he looks at it with a somber face. "The storm has approached.. And It looks like it's for me. Ugh.. I wonder.." said Mijo, as he accidentally controlled the water of the rain, directing it to some people below, in the gymnasium. "Ah, fudge.. Sorry, sorry— Wait, I can do that?! All this— mmm.. But, this doesn't change.. where should I go..?" said Mijo as he turned to the classrooms behind him. "Maybe.. well, ugh.. I can never make dark worlds **here.** Everything's too full, and.. there's no extra room around!" continued Mijo, as he looks at his bag.

"There's one option.. But.." said Mijo, as he readied his pencil. "It's gonna be unconventional." said Mijo, as he sticks a small hole into the insides of the bag. "Ok, well.. Here goes nothing!" exclaimed Mijo, as he stabbed the bag, causing a dark explosion to take him inside the bag. He goes into the world, ready to land as he falls on rough, uneven and broken ground. "Ugh.. what the fudge is wrong.. with this.. if I did it correctly, only Jomi's town should appear." said Mijo, as he stood up, his body aching. He walked around until Jomi saw him and they met.

"Hi, Jomi..." said Mijo with a harsh tone. "Hello, Mijo! How's it been? Doing good?" asked Jomi with a smile. "Bad. As always, why so happy?" responded Mijo, as they started walking and Jomi changed to a more concerned tone. "Oh? Um, living life is always a blessing, y'know? No major abyss threat too, that's good. Oh, the games you and.. uh, _her_ made are doing good with my creative direction and some darkners interested in magical entertainment programming. I gotta ask you though, I know.. you've been in a bad attitude ever since, the new school year.. But, there's so many things to look forward too! Like me!" reassured Jomi, with another smile. "That's the worst part. Do I not get to enjoy all of life and only this part, and for how long?" responded Mijo, asking another question, clearly had been deep in depressive thought.

"Uh.. well, I know how much you hate CAT, maybe you can.. uh.. well, I don't really know. But, like writing and talking about it is a good way to cope, no? Also, it's not everything, it's just one subject. Uh, even if it affects the average, as long as you're high in science, math and english, you're fine!" retorted Jomi, trying to keep up her smile. Mijo looks at her with an unamused face. "Oh my— you're struggling there? Like.. everything? E—even sa English?!" asked Jomi, her smile fading to a concerned look. "Ok.. I.. realize that I am exaggerating.. But, understand me.. it was only math. and a quiz.. You understand how much that means to the grading system?!" explained Mijo, as they arrived at the library.

"Well, have you learned anything here? That's gotta account for something, no?" asked Jomi, with an exasperated tone. "I did.. But, it didn't really help me anywhere besides.. well, actually.. a few.. but, the point is, it's not like I haven't learned lessons but the simple separation already underscores the main issue, my level is way different. As I can keep up with dark world issues, and is one of the most powerful, in the light world, I am but a below average student, barely holding on." answered Mijo, now tired of even speaking. "Man, did I get all the therapeutic and self-love parts, or are you just that.. sad..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo didn't answer, he looked at Jomi, unsure of himself.

 "Well, you don't need to answer that. Let's.. oh, yeah! I have been developing a chat log of voice-to-text conversations. It's called, Chalo! Chalog? I don't know, but the main premise is, If I want or need to record someone's words and actions, I can just start the record, by typing `chalo -R 'test'` and it would start, it only saves on text for now, but soon it can save in markdown, and have a GUI! For now, it's just a CLI app." said Jomi, with a huge smile. "Oh? That's cool, what does it run on? How is it programmed, exactly?" asked Mijo, with a more neutral tone.

"`C#...` Yeah, I had to use some libraries, and I might have to figure out the GUI part, but besides that, we're good.. Look, it's just a learning thing, it's not a collab like the games, or as complex and important as the hologram training." answered Jomi, with a bit of embarrassment. "Oh, yeah.. That's what I was wondering, sure.. **we** helped, but you are the only constant in the dark world, so I am wondering how you haven't learnt to build a full-stack application library right now." retorted Mijo with a smirk. "I—I am just busy, ok?! Um, governing stuff, y'know.." said Jomi, as she turned to her computer, more embarrassed.

"Oh? Hey, hey.. you got any.. spicy art saved?" asked Mijo with a grin. "No—no! Why, would I do that, what.. do you save yours?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shaked his head. "But, I was just curious.. Eh.. anyways, it's not like you already know what we both like.. Anyway, why was that the first one I asked?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head and answered, "I don't fudging know, Mijo. You don't know, so I don't."

"Yeah, yeah. Whatever, moving on. Anything else new?" asked Mijo, as Jomi moved to a new tab on her laptop. "Ah, of course.
