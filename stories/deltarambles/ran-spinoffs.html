<p id="CS1"><md-block># DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark</md-block></p>

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after CS1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!

## Summary: 

When there's an important event to go to, especially where his friends are, Mijo tries magic but things go unexpected and he still has to go to the event.

## Author's Note: 

This _definitely_ doesn't say anything about me, it's just a fun idea turned into an actual story that I did because it would be fun to see this happen, might be canon, but you'll see.. anyways enjoy!

Edit 1: It has implicit sexual things, since I don't want to write one but it is the natural progression of things, so keep that in mind!

Edit 2: Oh god this is just the outline of c4GS1, well as I said _**might**_ be canon, I have taken some creative liberties with this one.

Edit 3: Shit, this is starting to be my main plot, i need help.

————————————————————————————

On the day before student's night, at Jomi's library, where Mijo was sifting through some books.

"Aha! I knew it! It exists!" said Mijo before Jomi surprises him.

"What exists?" said Jomi as Mijo jumps in surprise.

"Wha— You're here?! Um, no, nothing, yeah.." said Mijo as he closed the book.

"Hmm, that book is for transfiguration.. What are you thinking..?" said Jomi, as Mijo tries to return the books quietly.

"Uhh— nothing that _you_ are thinking of! Um, I'll be going to the.. training ground! Yep. Just—" said Mijo before Jomi stops him.

"Be honest, the student night is tomorrow and you are searching for magic that can modify your looks. Right?" said Jomi, as Mijo embarrassed, nodded.

"Alright, look, Don't try to hide anything from me, because.. I know you, you keep forgetting that—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah... I am not stupid, I just.. wanted to do this by myself you know? Like it's a surprise!"

"And? You can't just go to me and teach you, even though I'll make fun of you, I'll still help you, you know?" said Jomi, as Mijo took the book about transfiguration back from the bookshelf.

"Ok. But, you're always busy! Like, I just don't wanna disturb you in any of your work, like I would do in your situation." said Mijo, now finding that specific page.

"Hmm, you know too that I would help anyways, right? But, anyway... Since it's a special day tomorrow anyway here in the dark world too, I put some of the workload to my subjects. I still did my work, I am just on my break now, and went to see you." said Jomi as Mijo agrees and shows her the page.

"This, this one specifically. I wanna make a special form I can use and hide anytime." said Mijo, as Jomi carefully inspects the page.

"Transfiguration #4.1"
As with this magic, you can use transfiguration to turn yourself into anything you can imagine and design, current testing shows you can only modify yourself, and while lookalikes are possible, you cannot maintain them for long, as you have to use your own magic, and if it is far from your own look, it will also be more. An exception is for the different versions of yourself that you automatically have based on your genetics (**sex**, height, eye and hair colour; etc)...

"Oh, did you highlight the one with.. sex? Hey, hold on.. Oh no, I know what you're going to do.." said Jomi as Mijo is now awkwardly smiling.

"Yep... I also want to modify my clothing so that it can turn into a dress that I can wear, ya know for more effort?" said Mijo, as Jomi is genuinely thinking about the whole logistics.

"Uh.. sure. Let's go to my lab." said Jomi, before Mijo said, "Wait you have a lab?!" 

"Yeah. What? Where do you think I get my potions and random stuff I give? Stealing? Well, I refine stuff there.. Anyways let's go there." said Jomi, before they walked to the lab behind Jomi's desk near her throne room.

"Huh, you have a separate desk and throne? That's weird." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and they kept going to her lab.

"Welcome, to my lab! Stay here, I think I have a potion for this..." said Jomi, as she went to her potion storage to find the transfiguration potion she needed.

"Uh sure. I am just gonna look then." said Mijo, as Jomi searched through her collection. She went up, middle, down, until she found a heart-shaped potion with an eagle-shaped gem decoration that had a blend of pink and red liquid.

"Alright, here. This should do the trick." said Jomi as she gave the potion to Mijo before Mijo accidentally spilled it on himself.

"AH! SORRY! Um, what's happening to me..?!" said Mijo, as the liquid was absorbed into his body and he turned into the female version of himself, a Jomi that was wearing full gear, with a dress for some reason.

"Ooooh, interesting... Um, sorry for.. um laughing.. Hahaha.." said Jomi, as she picked up one of her notebooks and wrote down what happened to Mijo.

"Heh? Wait! I thought that I was supposed to have a way to change it, and.. this looks permanent!" said Mijo, as he now looks upon his changed body.

"Hahaha.. This is why, you don't spill these types of potions.. Anywho, I still need to fix your mistake, soo wait.." said Jomi, as Mijo silently watches Jomi pick out a notebook she had that she started silently reading.

"Hmmm, hey can you do me a favor and go to the light world with this.. form? Umm, try to improvise i guess.." said Jomi, as she flips another page.

"Uh.. um.. you sure I can act like you?" said Mijo, as Jomi looked at Mijo and smiled and nodded.

"Uh ok.. Um do I have to go into the lab again afterwards?" said Mijo, as Jomi now puts the book back down.

"No... Just, go near my desk, I still have stuff to do.. So after I make this I'll just be at my desk." said Jomi, as she picked out a container.

"Um.. Ok. I am only doing this because I am also curious ok? I am going now.." said Mijo as Jomi laughed and nodded as she grabbed a gem-based design, with a narrow mouth and wide body.

"Uh.. Ahem.. I gotta be as fast as possible, huh.. no heels.. great! I am just gonna run as fast as I can.. _Hopefully_ nobody notices." said Mijo, as he ran with a dress that didn't interfere with his legs but still slowed him down due to his new form.

"Hey! Jomi!" called JR to an unsuspecting Mijo, now a lookalike of Jomi in anything but clothes.

"Uh.. Yes?" said Mijo, trying to sound like Jomi.

"Uh, do you know where Mijo is? I wanna talk with him about something.." said JR, looking like he has a lot to say.

"Ah— Him? He.. He's probably at the library.. Check there!" said Mijo, as he awkwardly stared at JR, waiting for his response.

"Hmm, ok! He always goes there whenever he's not at the training grounds.. Anyways, see ya!" said JR, as Mijo also said, "See ya!" to JR.

"Whew, Um.. That was unexpected so I gotta go, quick before anybody notices!" said Mijo as he traveled further down to the light world connector and got transported to the light world, seeing Rhida chilling near the entrance. Mijo now looks like a schoolgirl with a tie and dress, just like how a typical female student would of Honrato Pez.

"Oh, hi— Uh, who are you? Um wait—" said Rhida, as Mijo awkwardly waves at her and says, "Oh, ah— I am.. Jomi? Yeah.."

"You're Jomi? Wait, aren't you—" said Rhida before Mijo interrupted, "Yes, I am still the pink notebook, just um.. I have the special properties of being able to have this form while outside the dark world, yeah!"

"Oooh, you haven't told me that.. Interesting, so I can bring you with me tomorrow, or even later??" said Rhida, as Mijo tries hard to get out of the conversation.

"Um.. No, I still have important stuff to do in the dark world, I just.. wanted to test something, for more details, ask Mijo about it later!" said Mijo, as he tries desperately to go back to the dark world secretly.

"Oooh! Ok I am sure it's _very_ important so I'll leave you and Mijo to do it, remember our deal!"  said Rhida, as she continued browsing through her phone.

"Ah, thanks! I'll be going now!" said Mijo, as he finally went back, thinking what deal Jomi made and how Jomi and her were on good terms, even before she went to him, and after the incident during the previous cataclysm.

"Uh.. I'll ask Jomi later, anyways, it's pretty clear what happened, I have to go, now!" said Mijo, as he ran as fast as possible to Jomi's desk.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's desk*

Jomi was humming something as she managed her government papers, as JR entered her hall with a door connecting her lab, throne room and library.

"Woah! Jomi? I thought you were outside or something and, didn't you have like.. your battle gear on? Why do you _still_ have your... mayor suit?" said JR, as Jomi stops humming and looks at JR, surprised.

"Wha— Oh. Uh, right. Um, I just switched out of them, yeah. I am just sorting some documents now." said Jomi, surprised but understanding the situation.

"Uhuh, anyways is Mijo still behind this library? I still have something to say to him." said JR, as  Jomi nodded and JR proceeded to go in the library, closing the door behind him.

Then Mijo appeared, opening the door leading to the hall, and was heavily breathing, and shouted to Jomi, "Jomi! Jomi! We *need* to go into your lab, *now!"*

"Haha, lets be quick, JR is waiting behind that door..!" said Jomi, pointing to the library door before Mijo rushed into her lab, as Jomi follows closely and closes the door.

"Aight, you sure you want your old body back? You could just forego your old identity haha.." said Jomi sarcastically as she grabbed the potion from earlier that she made.

"Yes, of course! Wh— I mean, I still need to attend school and I can't exactly register you as a student so—" answered Mijo, before Jomi suddenlt gives him the potion. "Yeah, yeah I am joking, I wouldn't wanna know how that works, anyway.." said Jomi, before Mijo drank the potion and afterwards, put it in a nearby table. "This is a temporary fix, since developing the potion that instantly changes clothes and body, et cetera.. Takes more time, so what I am doing is using your current clothes, but you change form depending on.. your glasses!"

"Wha— My glasses..? So, like.. woah!" said Mijo before he suddenly changed form to his old self, with his usual dark world clothing. "So.. If I understand correctly, my.. other form is my actual body, and this is like a disguise for now?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "Yep, that means if you even separate yourself from your glasses, you'll turn to a girl! This is the price you pay for ruining my glass, now I'll actually have to steal from someone haha.."

"Don't! So, like.. How long does this.. potion take to make?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi cleans the potion and puts it back in the empty containers. "Hmm, I'll tell you when it's done, now get out, JR's waiting for you lol." answered Jomi, as she pushes Mijo out and closes the lab door. "Hey! You use lol IRL?! Bruh—" said Mijo to the lab door, as JR pats his back to get his attention.

"H—huh? Oh, hi..! I was just talking with Jomi about a book I found, what do you want..?" asked Mijo, as JR looks at him with disapproval before saying, "Uhuh.. Anyway, I have to talk to you about something.. Is she going out of that.. back room of hers?"

"Uh.. probably? Let's talk in the library then." said Mijo, just as they walked to the library and headed for a nearby seating.

"So, is there any reason why you haven't been out of the library for.. the entirety of the intramurals? Like, after that day, whenever I asked Jomi where were you, she said here, so I am simply curious.. What are you studying, maybe I can help..?" asked JR, as Mijo tries to hide his embarrassment at his words. "Oh.. yeah.. Sorry, just kinda busy, y'know.. Abyss Doctor stuff, so I have just been preparing.. I mean, I do go out, just not when you're around I guess.." answered Mijo, as he looks over at the part near the transfiguration book.

"Hmm..? Alright, yeah.. the abyss doctor.. I wonder when he'll come back... Well, that's... Hm... Sige, I'll leave you to it. Pag kailangan mo, we're here. Anyways, this new mushroom based attack, Imma see if I can do it.." said JR, as he stood up and left the library. "Good luck! *sigh* Now what.. I am basically a different person inside.. Ugh.. How does it even work..? Like, is it frozen in time or something.. or.. I don't even want to know.." mutterred Mijo to himself as he contemplated his life decisions.

"Hey! Mijo! Our daily sparring match? Did you forget?" asked Urda, as she entered the library. "O—oh! Yeah, lets go." responded Mijo, as he walked up to her and they walked to the training ground.

"Same as before, magic healthbar and no holding back, ok?" said Urda, as they prepared their weapons. "Alright, let's dance!" shouted Mijo, before they started their spar with Urda pressing a button to do so.

First, Mijo acted first slashing his way near Urda, before stunning her with his summoning slashes, as he follows it up with a slash up, so she gets knocked up, and as she is up, he quickly slashes her as he brings her down. Then he quickly teleports away, as before she could act, he managed to get a few more slashes in. Urda decides to use her gun to fire projectiles at Mijo, as he teleports and dodges all of them, as he gets the jump at Urda, quickly slashing her as Urda tries to block. Then he comes back and keeps putting pressure as she is unable to act as he keeps slashing and stabbing her. As he moves away, Urda decides to use her gun to blast in his general direction, he easily dodges and manages to keep bringing her healthbar down. Then as Urda decides to use wind to keep herself up and to block his shots, he decides to use his ultimate and break through space to deal a lot of damage. She falls down and Mijo deals a lot of damage to her as she is stunned by this amount of damage, by using his big sword and enhanced unarmed combat wear. Then as she finally has a chance to breathe, he uses his ultimate again, finishing the spar with him winning. 

"Haha.. you uh.. having a good day today.. I guess.. Whew.. And this close to student's night.." said Urda, as she sits down at the ground, exhausted. "Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I was that perfect, anyways.. What.. else..?" responded Mijo, as he also sits down, tired.

"I don't know, honestly.. Wanna get some food? Our spars just consume a lot of our energy.. so yeah." asked Urda, with a bit of hesitation. "Honestly, what time even is it.. I was so caught up with.. everything.. Just in general, abyss doctor stuff, my personal stuff, the school stuff, a lot.." said Mijo, not answering her question.

"Uh.. it's.. 2:30 PM in the light world.. What's on your mind, you can tell me... I won't judge!" said  Urda reassuringly, as she moves closer to him.
"Uh.. well, it's a secret, ok? I.. really am embarrassed about it.. I just don't wanna say _anything_ about it.." responded Mijo, as he tries to stay composed.

"Are you suuure..? I basically know most of your secrets, like Jomi.. Rhida.. you know what I mean." asked Urda, as she persistently bothers Mijo about it. " *sigh* Fiiine. Hold on, lemme stand up." said Mijo, acquiescing to her request. So he stood up, walked a few steps away from her and took off his glasses to reveal his actual form, with longer hair to the shoulder, a bigger chest area, and a more feminine body type, like Jomi's but with a bit more muscle.

"W—woah!! Are you actually Jomi?" questioned Urda, before Jomi appeared behind her, answering "Maybe..!", as she jumps up and sees the two, the only difference between them being how they style themselves. With Jomi, a more formal and royal purple look, while Mijo with his usual dark red and blue contrasting each other with a rough look.

"H—huh?! Two Jomis?!" questioned Urda, as Mijo wore his glasses again, turning him back to this 'old self'. "No.. Just a lil' magic that Mijo personally requested.. Anyways, I am going.. I just wanted to _check in..!_ " answered Jomi before she left, her steps being noticed by the other two.

"O—oh, whew.. Wait.. what magic?!" shouted Urda, before Jomi was far enough to not hear or see them. "Transformation Magic... That's what I've been busy with for a few days.. actually." answered Mijo, as Urda gasped at this answer. "No way..! So that's what you've been doing in the library! What's the reason..?" asked Urda, as Mijo comes closer to Urda.

"Just.. an experiment, that's all! I swear." said Mijo, as Urda chuckles. "Really..? Are you suure? Because I think there's a lot more to this than you say.." said Urda, teasing him again. "I am sure, alright.. one more round?" responded Mijo, standing up again.

"Haha.. Sure, but I want your girl form, deal?" said Urda, before Mijo reluctantly nodded and took off his glasses. "My glasses are for style points anyway, since getting this new form I have been able to see without it." responded Mijo, before he got his weapons ready.

"Coool, I should look into it, then." said Urda, as she started the spar, with health bars popping up.

They have a standoff as they look at each other intently for a while, before Mijo makes the first move, starting with his big slash using his big sword to slash as it gets deflected by Urda. Then he jumps high to the air and summons slashes against Urda as he does a big final slash, as he manages to get a small knock back as he lands. Suddenly Urda's blade clashed with Mijo's as he was knocked back and managed to backflip as he landed on his feet as he was knocked into the air and knocked back down with a combo from Urda. He then managed to switch to his other sword as he deflected a follow up attack and countered as he maintained his ground. Then they locked blades as they looked at each other intently before a quick deflect from Mijo due to a quick shot from Urda, pushed each other away. They both try to use their own ultimates as the two simultaneously attack each other and as it finishes, Mijo is noticeably lower in health. Urda tries to blast and maneuver Mijo as much as she can, as Mijo dodges, parries and counters her attack. Then Mijo attacks with a very risky move, moving to stab Urda straight at the heart as Urda brings down his health little by little, as he managed to get an opportunity and as she notices, she decides to counter and as the two stab each other in the chest, the game's over with Urda winning the duel.

Heavy breathing from both sides as both pull out their weapons. "Man, if we were just a little more risky, we could have damaged each other for real.." said Mijo, as he lay down on the floor. "Yeah.. Good game to you, but I managed to have enough health to tank that before you lost." responded Urda, as she also sits on the floor.

"Mhmm.. Well, what time is it? It's probably time to go home for today.." asked Mijo, as Urda responded, "Uhh oh, it's 3:30 PM, we should head back, it's a Thursday.. I don't know about you, but our sir is particularly strict, so I gotta go.. See you tomorrow!", as she waves Mijo goodbye as she walks back to enter the light world. He picks up his glasses and starts walking out of the training ground.

"I should head back too, a lot of prep is needed, and I am kinda tired too." muttered Mijo as he walked his way near the exit of the dark world. "Hey~" said Jomi, as she surprises Mijo again with a smile. "H—huh?! Oh, uh.. Jomi.. what do you want?" responded Mijo, as Jomi shows herself in front of him.

"Sooo what do you think..? Any.. complaints?" asked Jomi, as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah, are you done with the potion?"

"No.. I would've told you, anywho... I can see your hesitance and.. conflicted mind. So, I will say that you'll have an... interesting night ahead of you, don't worry.. I am working on it, just see me next week, ok?" responded Jomi, as Mijo sighs heavily and says, "Yeah, yeah.. I am.. just curious, does the.. change of clothes like earlier before the temporary potion, work now?"

"Should be the same, haha.. I can already tell in your eyes what you're thinking, all of it.. Try it, you'll have time to try before tomorrow, and... oh! Yeah, uh.. as for any side effects beside the obvious, this type of magic actually affects _those_ areas, but I'll need more time to figure out specifics, so hey! Why not try everything you've always wanted to try, maybe you'll learn something!" explained Jomi, before winking and gesturing Mijo to leave. "Ugh.. I sure do love and hate having someone like you around.. Anyway, then.. see you next week!" said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other.

As he goes out of the dark world and closes the portal for the next few days, he knows that he can't get there tomorrow and then the weekends too. He goes into their classroom and gets his bag as he sees his friends, Ikari already go out, and Lauvielle talking to somebody else. He then picks up his bag and leaves as his other classmates continue cleaning the room. He then checks the time, and it looks like it's 15:50, as he feels the breeze of the wind. He then looks at his phone, and stares at the home screen, knowing if he presses anything he won't ever get out of the internet spiral. Then his thoughts move on to his notes app, maybe he should start a diary of this, or maybe he should continue that memoir disguised as fantasy fiction of his adventures, but as he thinks of this, a certain JR comes up to him, as he exits the classroom.

"Hey. I have a question, is there going to be a chance to open and close the dark world during the morning, before the preparations for students night eventually take over?" asked JR, as Mijo is snapped out of his thoughts and looks at JR and answers, "Maybe.. I'll try to be early tomorrow, but you know me.. Since I largely don't care about the morning 'year-end party', I can maybe sneak it in before it officially starts.. Urda's probably busy with her class, but she might come up.. we'll see."

"Ok. Goodbye. See you tomorrow!" said JR, as he waved goodbye, going out of Mijo's vision by turning a corner. "Oh, right.. I might not care about the morning, but the night.. People say that.. to enjoy this once-a-year event in school, since you only ever get 6 times before it isn't the same anymore, but.. I.. really have well, no one else to _enjoy_ the night, my friends have their own dance, and the others might either leave or hangout with the others, since they're more.. confident?" muttered Mijo to himself, as he leans on a railing overlooking the school near his room.

"This new body too, Jomi's always vague with her words, but.. can't blame her honestly.. It's something I would do if I saw someone go through my situation. Anyways, times like these.. I always think about it, but.. there's just..  little things that I actually change. Huh.. Time often is wasted away by me, but.. I guess this is technically just waiting for my dad to pick me up, but what I could be doing during that time.. It's so much more than.. now. I think my often self-reflections are good, but then I should do something about it, it gets worse since I don't even share this, at least.. not willingly..." said Mijo to himself, as behind him his classmates finish cleaning, lock the classroom and leave.

"Oh, I should go down, and.. *sigh* Rhida's gone.. Welp, my chance with her is gone, anyways.. anything I want to do isn't until I go home, so imma just play some mobile videogames, like.. oooh! A companion game to Shingen Inpakuto, Honkstar Railway!" said Mijo, as he walked down the stairs as he went to a nearby unofficial waiting area that was just a student hangout place that was coincidentally close to the school gate.

He eventually decided to go and walk home. As he settles down in his bed, as he does the usual change to home clothes. Then he goes to his room that had his computer setup, since his house was built with separate shared bedrooms and other rooms used for work or school-related stuff.

"Whew.. Finally home and I can.. experiment. Hopefully they don't notice, or don't just enter my room without noise, I don't really wanna lock it since I'll have to explain why, and.. hopefully I can get this done and then, rest and watch some videos, play some games, et cetera.." muttered Mijo to himself as he enters another room that's used for extra bed space and storage for other people.

"Ok, first.. The obvious first thing that any person would do if they switched bodies is check.. this." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and then his pajamas. "Uh.. well, I guess I should.." said Mijo, as he took off his shirt.

Meanwhile in the living room, May and June, his parents are talking about work stuff. 

"Then, this girl was complaining about the foods that the campaign manager gave her since the other side had larger portions, while I was just listening intently trying to be discreet in eavesdropping, afterwards we talked about it, it's just another crazy day of government office volunteering.." ranted May, as June remarks, "Yeah, that's just how people are. It's fine, they probably just got irritated by something else.. I don't want to say what that could be, since it could be anything anyway."

"Oh yeah, food's ready. Call our son." said May, before June walks to where Mijo is. 

As Mijo looks at his body, he gets the urge to see what would happen if he touched it.

"Should I..? Should I? I.. don't think there's anything else to do, I can look at the fit of different clothes later. Uh.. oh no.. that's likely dad... I should immediately dress up and confront him, it's likely dinner time.." said Mijo to himself as he quickly dressed back up, hearing his dad walk to his room. Then he sees his dad and greets him, so they can eat dinner.

Then they eat dinner, as he half-heartedly listens to his parents conversation and after a while he finishes his food. He heads off to his room again afterwards and lays down on the floor while listening to a random long video in his recommendation. 

"Ugh... I really should've just went and talked to someone after closing the dark world.. At least then, I'll have something to look forward to, aside from the food and drinks.. of course." said Mijo as he stared at the ceiling. "I could just play videogames, but Urda isn't online.. Neither is Lauvielle nor Ikari.. Hmm.. I should probably figure out what to do, but.. wait!" muttered Mijo, as he jumped up and stood on his feet.

"The experiment hasn't finished yet! Let's head to the other room again." said Mijo to himself as he walked to the other room and closed the door, making sure to lock it, since he shouldn't be expecting anyone. Then he stripped himself again, taking off his clothes and glasses.

"Ok, alright. Uh.. sooo, i mean.. what else is there to do? It doesn't have the same effect as if I either changed form fully or Jomi manages to go out of the dark world, since relatively a few things change, besides inside me but that's easy.. to hide! Anyway, I should just get on with it, since Jomi likely expects me to do this, and.. this is one of the few times that magic is brought to the light world. So, here goes nothing!" said Mijo, as he starts touching himself in the changes around the chest and crotch areas.

"Huh, that's weird. This.. _aroused_ feeling, it's weird. Is it because of my brain, or is it the magic..? I am going to.. lay down on the bed." said Mijo, as he lay down on the bed pushing away his clothes. "Ugh.. Mmm.. I'm going to stop, I've promised myself to not go too far with this, I.. think it's enough. My.. breathing is noticeably faster and so is my heartbeat.. I.. I am gonna pass out." said Mijo, as he unexpectedly closed his eyes due to mixed euphoria and dizziness that he felt. After an hour or two, a knock is heard at the door as May calls on Mijo, "Mijo! Mijo! Your clothes for tomorrow! Try it out!"

"H—huh..? Oh shi.. Right, the students night! Oh no—" said Mijo as he quickly dresses up and gets his glasses, transforming himself back. "Yeah! Coming! Wait a sec!" shouted Mijo back, as May responded, "Ok! I'll be waiting in the living room!"

"Whew.. Uh.. What happened..? One moment, I was just.. exploring and.. uh.. y—you know what, I am just going to ignore that and quickly go to where she is." said Mijo, before he opened the door, grabbed his phone and left to go to the living room.

"So here's the clothes for the year-end party in the morning, then we switch it out with this one for students night in the afternoon until midnight. Try it out!" said May, as she gestured to Mijo to try the first one. Then Mijo tried the first one as he put down his phone nearby, then went to go behind a big dresser cabinet to change as May looked at her phone, waiting for him.

"Oh no.. If she ever gets curious or wants to see me while I don't expect she could see.. welp, no point in dwelling. I just hope I get lucky." said Mijo as he tries his best to quickly change and then he reveals himself, his clothes being specifically picked out due to a theme of dark academia that the officers of his class decided, with a landslide vote for it due to the other themes not being serious.

"Oh wow, look how handsome you are in that style! What do _you_ think of it?" remarked May, as Mijo responds, "Yeah, it's fine i guess. It fits the theme for sure. Imma go try the other one." as he grabs the second one and goes behind the dresser again, and quickly changes to the second style, a dark blue polo with a large coat. Then he reveals this to his mom.

"Wow, even better.. It was a good decision to reuse those school pants since your polo is also dark blue, the coat looks nice but it might be too hot before night." said May, as Mijo nodded and asked, "Is.. that all, including the rice for tomorrow's school day event?"

"Yeah, change back, and I am going to prepare each of them for tomorrow, have fun tomorrow anak!" said May, as Mijo went and changed back and left to go back to his room after grabbing his phone again. "Whew.. Ok, that's done. Now, where were we.. Oh right, the whole.. experiment. What time even is it?" said Mijo, as he checks the time and sees it is 20:30, it is usually when he and Urda played games, but when he checked her profile, she was offline and most likely accidentally fell asleep again.

"Oh, well. Let's go back to experimenting, I better not lose my mind again." said Mijo, as he put down his phone and headed off to the other room. Then he closed the door, locking it again, then undressed again, taking off his clothes and glasses. "Ok, so.. uh.. I am just gonna continue and stop when it affects me, because.. whatever happened earlier, the memories are far too dizzy to be a success in exploring." said Mijo, before he touched himself in the chest and crotch areas again, then after some short somewhat unintentionally sensual touches, he laid down in the bed again, trying to process and stay conscious, with the same effect as before, heavy breathing, faster heartbeat, and subconscious moving on his hips and legs.

"Wha— What..? Why.. Is this... I.. ugh.. I am going to.. mmm.. just try to stay still, and.. yeah.." said Mijo, as he tried to stay conscious and experience the euphoria of pleasure as well as the overwhelming sense of dizziness from the sudden experience. "Whew.. Come on, stay determined.. Don't lose focus.. just like before.. ahh.. uh.. ok, i am gonna, ah!" said Mijo as he tries to move his body accidentally touching his other parts, stopping him from continuing to move.

"I.. don't think this is normal.. While it.. has some similarities from what I've read.. this is way too.. extreme. What was.. in those two potions? I guess... this is... somewhat brand new.. at least, inferring from Jomi's vague wording..." said Mijo as he stayed still, attempting to wait out the sensation. He waits for a while, but the feeling never goes away, although it is less intense than before.

"Hah.. I can't keep this up, while.. it's so.. intoxicating.. I can't keep this for long.. Wait.. I have to write it down.. My phone..!" said Mijo, as he attempts to go out of bed and get to his phone, as he unlocks the door.

"Just... have to.. get this.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he grabbed his phone and walked quickly as fast as he could, with being dizzy and not having clothes on, and locked his door again, then he stumbles back to his bed, beginning to close his eyes. "No.. I.. have to, go to my notes app, and.. ugh.. No.. video?" said Mijo, as he looked at his phone and focused on the notes then the camera app.

"Ok, record.. Listen, Mijo.. Don't save this video nor should you let anyone but yourself see this, you've made this phone for yourself so.. anything that you see, write it down please.. Now.. no.. uh.. my.. storage.." said Mijo as he closed his eyes and fell unconscious, as the camera continued recording. Then after 2 hours, he finally wakes up in a daze.

"Huh.. Hah? Hah! What? I am still in this form.. and my phone? Oh no, my storage.. It's been recording for two hours, let's see what it recorded." said Mijo, as he stopped the recording and looked at the video, it replayed the first part, the whole message then after losing consciousness, after two minutes, he suddenly sees himself move his hands to the crotch and chest area and moan a bit before he paused and turned the screen off. "N—no... We are not watching me.. doing that for 2 hours. But.. ugh.. is that even me? Is.. Is that me? Is that what I did.. But.. why don't I remember this..? Like.. it's all hazy and dizzy, vaguely pleasurable but.. *sigh* I don't know.. and.. it's 23:30 too.. It's almost time to sleep so I can be early tomorrow..", as he lays down on the bed.

"I.. should check my.. huh?" said Mijo, as he looks into his notifications and sees messages from Urda 1 hour ago. 

Urda: Hey bro wanna play some Shingen Inpakuto? 
Let's do that new character's story quest like that girl with a gun that is a guard?
Oh you might be busy that's fine! I'll save it for saturday then, I'm just going to play in our Digmake Server! You'll have a surprise ;)

"Digmake? Like... the server we paid for 500 pesos? Huh.. It's a sandbox survival game, I wonder what she's trying to do.. blow up my house with TNT? Or replace it with a dirt house? Oh well. It was an hour ago, she must be still there.. But, I still have to continue my Shingen dailies!" said Mijo, as he went out of his bed and dressed up as he got his glasses and he transformed back. "Then let's get my phone and play some Shingen, then hop on the server!" muttered Mijo, as he grabbed his phone then went out of the room as he closed the door.

He went to his computer and started playing videogames, enjoying his time in Shingen and Digmake as he kept his phone charged and off. After a while, he eventually stopped playing and said goodbye to Urda as they logged off the night. He checked the time, and it was 0:30, an hour after the second experiment. He decides it was probably time to sleep and does the routine of cleaning and closing the room for the night before he heads off to his bed. As he does some chores before he heads off to bed, he listens to some videos as he tries to put the events before in the back of his mind, as it brings up memories that he prefers not to think of for now. 

Then he heads off to bed and sleeps, trying to move on and hopefully have a normal day tomorrow, although he sleeps without his glasses and he also grabs a long blanket to hopefully conceal any noticeable changes from his mother since she sleeps near him on another bed in the same room. As he sleeps, he begins to dream about the special events vaguely happening as it distorts to Jomi noticing and watching. In his dream, it is distorted to have more sensual and pleasure than what actually happened as he begins to imagine Jomi observing then ignoring him. Then after 6 hours, he wakes up with a phone alarm playing, as he turns it off with a morning look.

"Agh.. Welp, I guess it's time. I better get my glasses and—" said Mijo, as someone is heard closing on him. "Not this time!" muttered Mijo to himself as he wears his glasses and transforms back. His father arrives and leaves due to seeing him clearly awake so he got out of bed, grabbed his phone and headed off to eat. He eats and then he goes off to shower, not forgetting to transform once inside the shower since it is hidden from anyone else, he notices the changes to how he showers due to the transformation, but he keeps focused at his routine. After showering, he grabs his towel and wears his glasses as he heads off to another room and dresses up as he watches his surroundings making sure no one sees him until he's done. Then he went to the living room to grab his shoes and school I.D.

"I'm just going to clean this.." said June, as he takes the glasses of Mijo to properly clean it with anti-fogging liquid with a large microfiber cloth. He noticed this immediately but he didn't want to draw attention as his chest was getting heavier on his clothes. He continued putting on his shoes as his father finished cleaning and put it down on the table as Mijo grabbed it before June looked at him again, as he transformed back. He then left to go and prepare their vehicle as Mijo put his phone in his sling bag, grabbed his things, looked himself in the mirror then promptly grabbed his face mask then left as May went out of the room to grab something as she noticed Mijo leave. "Bye anak!" said May, as they both wave goodbye to each other.

Then he went to his dad, so they drove to school. As this happens, Mijo is checking on his phone for messages in the classroom GC about the party, then he looks at the rice container that his classmates asked him to bring. Then he checks the other GC to see Urda telling him that she barely managed to get the time to open the dark world before being dragged into her classroom for the class by class party. Then he was dropped off at school as they waved goodbye to each other and he went into school. He brought his rice container on the way, walking up stairs, into their classroom before sneakily going out and jumping in the dark world nearby. He lands to find no one nearby.

"W—wait.. Where is everybody..? Jomi usually meets me here.. Hmm, though she could be just in her castle but.. then where's the bustling atmosphere..?" remarked Mijo, as he walked to Jomi's castle. He then noticed some guards at the entrance as he was stopped by them. "Her Majesty Jomi isn't allowing any lightners nor any of us to enter the castle!" said one of the guards.

"Then where's the others? Where's Jomi?" questioned Mijo, as the guards looked at each other and gave Mijo a piece of paper with Jomi's handwriting.

Hey, If you see this, this means that I have left the castle with some guards to deal with some abyss threats. I am currently writing this in the downtime, but as for now, there was a sudden surge of abyss attacks that just happened, and so I've been focusing my efforts there, sorry if I couldn't be there and I promise I'll be there next time, until then.. follow my orders and leave for now. The other people have either joined me or have joined the other guards in protecting and making shelter. The timeframe is this day, that includes your students night, so good luck there and have fun! 

— signed by Jomi (The Princess~)

"O—oh.. I see.. I'll have to inform the others, have you seen any other lightner?" asked Mijo, as the other guard answered, "We saw Miss Urda enter first and then Sir JR entered before they went to us, we explained the situation then they left."

"I see. I'll go now. Good luck soldiers." said Mijo, as the other guards saluted as he left and returned to the light world. He went out and closed the dark world as JR was waiting for him outside their classroom.

"Hey, you closed the dark world, right?" asked JR, as Mijo nodded and leaned into the wall nearby him. "Well, Jomi said something about the abyss threats, and you said you've been researching about the abyss and the abyss doctor. Soo, any information you can.. share?" asked JR, as Mijo thought about it and answered, "Uh.. Well, I've also been reading about him and have been talking with Jomi a lot, however this one was unexpected, not even we expected it, so I am just waiting until next week or later to see what happens."

"I see, I was also wondering but couldn't ask anyone knowledgeable enough, such as you, or Jomi. Hmm.. Wouldn't this dark world crisis affect the party today?" asked JR, as Mijo answered, "I think so, but I don't know when it will erupt so I guess we have to stay vigilant."

"Welp, I guess we just enjoy until battle is necessary then, are you.. coming in the classroom?" questioned JR, as Mijo smiles and responds, "Just tell them that I am sick or something, I.. got a disguise..!" as he reveals his transformation by taking off his glasses.

"Oh! oh? Magic works in the light world?" questioned JR, as Mijo showed off and answered, "Think so, you'll have to ask Jomi—" as they both say, "But she is busy!"

"Yeah! She is. Anyways, what do you think?" asked Mijo as JR inspects Mijo, "You look like Jomi in a suit honestly." remarks JR, as Mijo nodded and said, "That's true. Anyways are you going in? It looks like it's starting."

"Yeah, uh good luck I guess." said JR, as he went inside and a couple of others started to call on the class. He transformed back to his other form, and chilled outside of the classroom, as he scrolled on his phone. He messages the GC saying that the dark world was closed due to abyss threats and that they should stay vigilant but be informed. He goes back to scrolling his phone.

After a lot of doing nothing, he decides to transform and check out the school, making sure to watch out for other people. There were surveillance cameras, but to the cameras it looked like there was just a student that was walking around, and there could be many reasons why so he also thought of reasons if he ever gets questioned. He is particularly going to a demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it.

"Hey, uhh where _is_ Mijo? Doesn't the message in the GC say that the dark world was closed? Then where is he?!" questioned Ikari, as she sits in a chair in the classroom, as she's talking to Lauvielle. "I don't know.. I was going to ask JR, but he seems busy.." responded Lauvielle, as JR is talking to someone else about something. "And you two have.." said Ikari, before Lauvielle said, "Yeah.. we uh.. have somewhat of a falling out due to our research project having some issues, you get it, Mijo talked about it in our 3-person GC."

"Oh look, he seems to be finished. I'll go ask, he sees me less.. negatively. Than you at least." said Ikari, ss Lauvielle nodded and watched Ikari go towards JR. "Yeah, the zoo party game was a total mess. I don't wanna know what they thought would happen when a bunch of highschoolers scream at each other to find their 'group'." said JR, as Ikari overhears this and says to JR, "Hey JR, I have a question."

"Oh? Yeah, what is it?" asked JR before Ikari answers, "Where is.. Mijo? He uh.. told us about.." she looks around and continues, "the dark, yeah. And I was wondering if.. no, where he is?"

"Oh. Hm." responds JR as he also looked around, before answering, "He's.. hmm, check the GC. I'll post there."

"Oh, ok. I'll await it then." said Ikari, as she goes back near Lauvielle. "Oh? My phone? Ah ok.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari nudges her to check her phone. They go to the gc to see JR typing until a message appeared:

JR: As for @Mijo's whereabouts, he told me to tell you guys he's sick but we know that's codeword for he's not going to attend class for a reason, likely the reason why the dark world was closed, staytuned he might need us

"Oh, so he's like on a quest again, like what Urda told us Jomi is on... They really are.." said Lauvielle, before Ikari interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I get it. Hmm, I'm kinda bored.. Why don't we help Mijo? Let's say we want to go the CR, I am sure they won't care."

"Uh... ok. Tara." said Lauvielle as the two excused themselves from the classroom party and headed outside. "Easy. Let's.. huh, who is that?" questioned Ikari, as she looks over to a girl who is headed to the ruins of a demolished building. 

Meanwhile, Mijo has entered the ruins of the demolished area, as he uses his transformation to avoid anyone recognizing him. He was particularly interested how spacious it was and how it was ignored and there has been no effort to close it off. "Huh, this is interesting.. You know, if there was a boss fight here, it would have the space! But.. I am sure nothing bad will happen.. please?" said Mijo to himself, as he heard a loud thud behind his back. "Aw man.." said Mijo, as he turned around to see a dark abyss figure materialize in front of him. "And.. Where's my weapons? Uh, oh no." said Mijo, as he tried to summon his weapons with no response. "You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "Oh no, uh.. stick? That will do." said Mijo, as he grabbed a long wooden stick to protect himself. The dark figure immediately sprung to slash him, easily breaking his stick and forcing him back. "I am soo fucked." said Mijo as he looked at the dark figure walking at him intimidatingly. "Welp, I guess it was good while it lasted.." said Mijo, as the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground, as the other two watched at the sidelines.

"T—that abyss monster just killed her! W—we have to get everyone here!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari got her phone to quickly call the others. "Wait.. where's Mijo then? He's supposed to handle stuff like this.." asked Ikari, as they both frantically call their GC. "If he was here, he wouldn't be able to do anything?! We don't have our own magic, so he doesn't but.. how did they appear?!" responded Lauvielle, as the dark figure looked at them menacingly. 

"Ah! Let's run!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari already started running as soon as the dark figure looked. "H—hey! Wait up!" shouted Lauvielle as she ran to Ikari's position.

Meanwhile, Mijo wakes up at an unknown dark space with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center. "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and to the ground, then he falls to the ground. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword and summoned the hilt as through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up..." said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two help Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "Y—yeah! Uh, JR told us you used transformation magic so we know that form, a—and.. we called as much backup as possible. I know you probably went here with the intention of not getting us involved, but.." explained Lauvielle before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others try to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summons a sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and kills the dark figure, making it dissapear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others look at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?" said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they waved goodbye to Mijo. As he rested and reflected, Urda, Rhida and Ikari were coincidentally right next to each other as the others left.

"Hey, you two.. You uh.. worried about Mijo? He seems to be.. well, going through a lot. I am not sure what he went through as he was.. in my arms but.. seeing his.. transformation and the fact that he hasn't even tried to get his stuff yet, I am.. concerned." said Rhida to the other two as they look at Mijo still staring off into the distance. "Yeah.. But, if you're thinking that we can help him, you should probably exclude me. I am the worst at.. comforting people, and he even comforts me a lot of the time... anyways, my dad's calling. See you two later!" responded Ikari as she left waving goodbye at the other two. "Is.. she saying the truth?" asked Rhida to Urda, as Urda shrugs and answers, "I don't know honestly.. I don't know much about her besides being her research partner, after she switched with her old one.. Mijo told me it was for complicated reasons but.. Lauvielle left early so I can't ask anyone else besides him."

"Uhuh.. Well, someone has to give him his stuff, and the rice container he brought.. Apparently his contribution to the party of his section..?" said Rhida, finding a way to smile amidst her troubled emotions. "Haha, well. I could do it, I guess.. But.. considering previous events.. You should do it." responded Urda, as Rhida blushed and says, "Huh? What? No no way..! Haha, even considering that.. You should do it, you were friends with him longer!"

"Hah? Really, are you missing this opportunity? Come on, sis its like a chance to dance with somebody, like the song they played at the mass demo for some reason.. I got this, you know.. like, I won't be jealous, ok?" retorts Urda, trying to hide her feelings. "I—is that— No way, I am.. not that confident, well no I am confident, just.. that we have a lot of baggage ok? You get it, and his parents might be calling him!" responds Rhida, as she looks over to Mijo then back to Urda. "Right, and that's why you should get this stuff and give it to him, and as he checks his belongings, you can ask him about—" said Urda, before being interrupted by Rhida, "W—what? You have experience? Like you've been trying to see if he likes you back by doing only subtle things to not ruin your relationship?"

"N—no... You're projecting your own actions, I.. uhh don't have any feelings, ok? Just, platonic pure gamer buddies.. always have.. been... Yep..." responds Urda, as she sits down on a nearby chair, now more troubled. "Um.. I.. think we have our own unresolved issues.. I.. didn't know you.. I'll go now." said Rhida, as she gives more space to her and Urda. Then as soon as Rhida was far enough, Mijo finally stood up and saw the two far away from each other, and his things at a table near the two girl's things.

"You two, are you still waiting for your parents?" asked Mijo, as he grabbed his things and checked his phone. The two girls tried to say something, but they fell short on what to say. "I see. Well, here's my glasses.. and oh look, perfect timing, my parents are on the way, judging by the time, they should be near.." continued Mijo, as he wore the glasses, transformed to his old form and was still looking at his phone. "I.. guess I'll be the first one. My parents are here, so.. Um.. hey, uh Mijo. Once the party happens, come meet me at the spot near the CR's, you'll know when.. I.. think. I gotta go now, see you two later!" proposed Rhida as she left, and waved goodbye as Mijo turned his attention to Urda.

"Oh, my turn.. again. Well, I am.. embarassed to say it, but to just confirm, you heard the entire convo earlier, right?" questioned Urda, as Mijo chuckles and answers, "Yeah, unwittingly.. I was going to grab my stuff but, I noticed you three talking so I stayed until done.."

"Oh. Oh. I am.. uh.. it took this long to reveal it huh.. Even after I thought you moved on.. Well, thanks for staying true to me all those times.. I—it's my fault, i guess.. I had.. romantic feelings for you, I should've just told you directly. But, you got her, Rhida.. And, we're just bestfriends." continued Urda, as she teared up a little. "I.. should go.. My parents are calling me and.." said Urda, before Mijo hugged her for a while before she broke away and says, "Thanks. Even though I know what your feelings are, you're still willing to give this.. girl something to hold onto. Goodbye, see ya." said Urda as she waved goodbye before Mijo also went home making sure to not bother her after she turned around and he started walking because his parents were there way earlier than  he expected.

He went home and rested on his bed as he stared at the ceiling, processing the events. He checked the GC to see the messages, there's only from Urda;

Urda: @everyone the current crisis has been temporarily fixed by the Mijo and the gang so enjoy your students night until another one appears lol

"Huh, ok.. Guess I don't need to message then." said Mijo, as he closed his phone and drifted to sleep, as he was still exhausted from the battle. He entered a dream where he was transported to school as he was about to enter it.

"Welp, just another day. Let's go." said Mijo, as he walked until he saw a certain girl that was facing the flag pole, that was directly ahead of him, so she was turned away from him. So he walked to the girl and questioned, "Uh.. who are you?"

"Oh, You don't know? I am you." said the girl, as Mijo responded, "Well, what's your name then?" as she chuckled and said, "It doesn't matter, Jomi.. Mijo.. I am still you..!"

"So, Jomi? What are you doing here? Is this the dark world from my first time, or the light school, the one that's.. real y'know?" questioned Mijo, as the girl responded, "Hmm, it's a bit different, how about you see for yourself..?" said the girl as she disappeared and Mijo quickly turned to see Urda at the open gymnasium. "Uh.. hey?" asked Mijo as he walked up to Urda, she was silent. "Hey..? You ok? You can tell me everything.." continued Mijo, as Urda started crying. "H—hey.. It's fine, just tell me. Please." asked Mijo as he became more distressed and worried. She continued crying for a while as Mijo tried to comfort her but to no avail. She stopped crying suddenly, and as she looked around and saw him, with a sad expression. "Oh, you're here.. I thought you'd already left.. Haha.. Everyone always.. drifts, and.. I am always alone. You get it, right?  Feeling alone while there's so many people around, and being able to make bonds that break every year.. And, the worst part is.. rejection. Haha, I feel like I am hopelessly drifting in life, and when you get that one connection and it just dies..?"

"I.. I.. I know, but.. is this about earlier? I am sorry, ok..? I just.. don't feel the same, even before I transformed. That's why I did actually, but.. I did suspect you for a while, then I thought you moved on.. Should I have—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupted, "No, actually It's all my fault. I don't think I'll ever get it right, and we're separated now right? It doesn't matter. Your words.. mean nothing to me now. I should've stayed by myself, relying on no one. For that, this.. dark power, is mine. I'll create something better.", as she held an unknown source of abyss power.

'H—huh? That doesn't make sense..? Stop blaming yourself! And what are you doing with that power?!" shoutrd Mijo, before Urda disappeared. "Oh, is that a reflection? or nonsensical amalgamation of your worse anxieties about her?" said the certain girl as she appeared behind him. "H—huh? I don't think of her like that! I don't think she hates herself, she probably just misspoke, it will never escalate!" responded Mijo, as the certain raised her eyebrows. "Oh, then you don't get it.. Let me show you the worst of the worst.." said the girl as she made Urda, Rhida and Jomi appear. "W—wait?! Then who are you?" questioned Mijo, as he looked at the three with different looks.

First, from the right to the left, Urda had both of her guns out with a dark blue aura, as well as floating double sword, with a neutral and numb face. Jomi had her long hair on her shoulders with a dark purple aura and a neutral face as she held a hilt at one hand and a blue fireball in the other hand. Rhida had her eyes whitened out as she floats with ice all around her as she wieled an ice sword. "What is this? Why are they just standing around?" questioned Mijo, as the certain girl's voice spoke to him, "These are your worst nightmares!" as the three suddenly teleport near him and start attacking. "My sword!" said Mijo, as he wielded a sword and deflected and parried their attacks as their relentless attacks wear down Mijo, before Jomi stabbed him at his heart. 

"Ah! Ugh.. I.. why.. what.. is this.. a dream?" said Mijo, as he was forced to stand up with immense pain as he looked at the three. "A dream, you needed to know. Now, let us set a scene.." said Jomi, as she set a chair she manifested as the others hold Mijo down. "I.. What is this supposed to be?! Jomi? You should understand, let me out!" shouted Mijo, as Jomi imprisoned her with dark magic. "This, is.. what you deserve." said Jomi, as the three of them tortured Mijo intensely with immense pain as it stayed like this for a while, as he woke up in a cold sweat, tears in his eyes and heavily breathing.

"What was that?! I.. what.. Who.. was that..? And.. I.. can't.. it's just a dream.. right? Haha, yeah.. It's nothing, it.. doesn't represent anything, haha..? I.. uh.. don't.. have anything to talk about, I don't think that dream's real, its just weird hehe.. I.. yeah sure.. Huh? My phone.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he checked his phone to see a message from Urda and Rhida. "Oh, it's them. I better go check their messages." said Mijo as he checks Urda's first. 

Urda: Bro I just got a dream where you like guide me to the school and you got Rhida to freeze my legs then you got Jomi and Rhida to beat me up as you looked at me having a smug face, then you decided to tie me to chair to have me be beat up by you idk if its like special but it wasn't like my other dreams so it could be dark world magic or something

"Oh. Lemme look at Rhida's then." said Mijo as he checks Rhida's message.

Rhida: Idk who to share this to but it includes you so i just had a dream where Jomi guided me to the school then she disappeared as then you appear me completely ignoring me as Urda and Jomi appear behind me to pull me away as you moved closer to me still ignoring me as Urda and Jomi try to beat me up and when I try to stop them you appeared stopping me and making me lose my footing as i fall to the ground and get dragged and tied up as the others bear me up its weird and so extreme but i think you might know what it entails

"Huh. Really? Interesting. They had the same dream but.. Jomi's there and that girl wasn't.. that's weird. I better check with Jomi later." said Mijo, as May calls him to prepare for students night.

After dressing up for students night, wearing a dark blue polo, dark blue pants and a black coat he decided to keep in his sling bag as it was still a bit hot outside. 

"Alright, you look good. Enjoy your night, 'nak!" said May, as he checked his belongings one more time, a ticket that he found while he was going through his stuff, it was the ticket to the students night area. Then his phone, handkerchief, water bottle, and coat. He then went to school as he was brought there by his dad.

"Goodbye anak enjoy your night!" said June, as Mijo entered the school grounds, waving goodbye back as his father left. Then he went inside as a teacher checked his bag for illegal stuff before letting him in, then he went to a student goverment panel where he saw a line for his grade.

"Huh, I guess that's what this is for.. I wonder who put it in here.." said Mijo, as he pulled out his ticket from his wallet and headed to a line, after waiting and being allowed in after signing in into a document, he sat where his fellow classmates are in the left side of the gymnasium as there were thousands of chairs organized. He picked a seat near some people he was acquaintances with and sat down then he saw JR returning from the CR. He sat down soon after.

"Hey, uh who put the ticket to students night on my bag? I wasn't there the entire party, so I couldn't have received it myself.." asked Mijo, as JR smirked and answered, "It was me.. I knew you wouldn't come back anyway, so I grabbed yours and put it in your bag."

"I see.. Thanks dude. Anyways, what do you think about the 'crisis'?" asked Mijo, still using codewords about the dark world related event they experienced earlier. "Hmm, well I think that the main problem likely isn't solved yet, and that's why I am staying here. I was going to leave and not even come here, but due to the issue, as well as the student government oath, I am here." responded JR, as he thought about being elected as a workshop manager in their local school robotics club.

"Cool, cool.. Is _she_ here? asked Mijo, as JR smiled and answered, "Duh. I was actually talking to her earlier, she's right there." as he pointed to a somewhat far away seat where Rhida was talking with some of her friends. "Oh then.. Ok, I'm just going to sit here.." said Mijo, as JR nodded and spoke to other people as he looked at his phone. He saw Ikari and Lauvielle separately panicking to him about being almost late since the time is getting closer to the start of the party. He looked back to his surroundings and saw Urda come in, speaking to her friends. He quickly looked away and took a picture of the general area as he saved it. 

He decided to observe the people coming in while keeping himself busy by looking at the messages of his friends. He saw Leviente come in then Fexili, as the afternoon darkens. After a while, it was pretty much late now but a few people were still coming in. Ikari came in as she walked nearby him and sat behind a couple of chairs that were free.

"Hi! I didn't notice you enter actually, I was looking at Lauvielle's messages, It's a good thing that you arrived, before the gates closed haha." remarked Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and responded, "Yeah, I arrived before I saw your last message, anyway.., Hold on, I'm going to talk to someone else, see you later..!" as Ikari talked to someone nearby.

 He then looked at his phone then back to the people, as he was observing and waiting for the event to start. He eventually saw Lauvielle come in, but he didn't talk to her, he just saw her go and seat at a nearby free chair. He got bored and started to play videogames in his phone before the event started and he put his phone in his bag.

"Hello, hello welcome to the night of your lives! As we celebrate another end of the school year, I would like to inaugurate our new school government, and associated clubs!" said the announcer on the stage. "Oh, it looks like the student government is on their way.." said Mijo to himself, as a bunch of random people, likely officers started to stand and walk near the stage.

"Ugh.. This is boring. I might as well go to the CR now.." said Mijo to himself, as he got out of his seat and went to the CR. Then as he went to the CR he bumped into Urda before going inside. "Oh, hi." said Urda, as Mijo waved and said, "Hi.. I'm going to the CR, so.. we'll talk later!" as he excused himself to continue inside the CR as he doesn't notice Urda's saddened expression.

After finishing, he went out of the CR and decided to head back, going through the same place he bumped into Urda before sitting down and seeing the inauguration happen. " *sigh* You know what, Imma start drinking, this sucks." said Mijo, as he drank the rest of his water bottle. "Oh that's it.." said Mijo, as the inauguration finishes and the other students head back to their seat. Then their school principal starts a speech that Mijo quickly tunes out, "Man, can we just start the party, or will I have to play Plants versus Robots, on my phone.. " said Mijo to himself, as he stared at the stage.

"Or—or.. Maybe some abyss monsters appear and.. wait, no... we're not even sure if we get our powers anymore. And with so many people outside.. Haha, I am kinda wondering.. when's.. the.. dance. Huh, I.. uh.. should.. where is she..?" said Mijo to himself, as he looks around and doesn't see Rhida. "Oh, no. Well, I better get going." said Mijo, as he stood up and rushed to the spot near the CR's Rhida was talking about.

"Uh.. is she here? Oh, that's definitely her." muttered Mijo to himself as he approached Rhida standing at the spot, waiting for him. "H—hey! So, what did you want to talk about..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was silent for a while before answering, "H—honestly.. I don't know.. And, I feel like I should say this now rather than any other time. Mijo, I've always considered my feelings, but.. throughout all of this, you've been.. silent.. You're not the type to not say anything about you, and who _you_ are. So, as.. much as I don't want to hear it... Mijo.. do you _still_ love me?"

Mijo was silent, he was taken aback, but he knew this was coming. But he understood what she was meaning by this, and answered, "I.. I.. guess I should've known you would say this, haha.. I always wondered.. why.. why can't I love you, or why can't I just turn on the switch and I'll be all lovey-dovey and we'll already be dancing on the dance floor... I thought this transformation would change something, if I experience something different I would feel it, but.. nothing. But it's not like I don't care about it, no.. even worse.. I obsess over it, without the love part. I've always been thinking, am I attached to you, because you said so, and so I shall.. or did I decide to 'try' because I got my opportunity..? I don't know, I don't know.. These complicated emotions, especially with the accidental transformation.. I just feel that if I say yes, would I be staying true to myself? You would want me to be me, right? But I don't know who is me, anyway. I've been struggling to think about it over school and dark world matters.. So, do I love you? I... I.. guess not, then.." answered Mijo, before looking at a wall, trying to avoid Rhida's gaze, as he is filled with dread, sadness and confusion.

"I—is that so..? You didn't... But.. why.. and.. *sigh* I.. have to.. excuse myself. Sorry, Mijo." said Rhida, as she rushed away to another private spot in the school. "I knew it.. This day would come. Just.. I wish.. ugh.. It's all gone now, I.. should've just said it to her straight, I.. *sigh* it's all gone. Haha.. I guess, even when your dreams come true, there's still conflict." muttered Mijo to himself, as he was seen by Urda, looking for him. 

"Oh? You're here? Uh.. Guess here goes nothing." said Urda to herself as she went over to Mijo. "Oh, w—what.. Are you here to bring me the second breakup..? Just.. speak." said Mijo, as he also avoids Urda's gaze. "H—huh? What happened..? I.. uh.. guess this is a bad time.." responded Urda, as Mijo continued, "Yes, it's always a bad time.. Now, if you don't have anything to say.. leave me alone."

"Hey? What's with the.. attitude..? Oh no, I see. I'll.. uh.. l—leave.. then." said Urda, realizing the implication, seeing Rhida leave earlier, with tears in her eyes. "Stay. You look like you have some important things to say, so say it now. Don't delay it." said Mijo, now gaining some semblance of toughness to Urda. "Oh, y—you know what, bro.. I think my statement is—" responded Urda, before Mijo, now turning to face Urda, trying to hold his emotions together, and interrupts "Do it. Any semblance of my emotional stability is gone, so carry on."

"Uh.. ok.. Whew... Now.. I completely forgot what I was going to say.. Shit.. Uh.. Hmm... I am sorry that whatever my mess is, you're dealing with it now.. But, uh.. Honestly dude.. I don't know what you two have been through but.. me? I have only realized one thing, I am just.. afraid of losing you. N—not in a romantic way! I think.. But, even with new people in new sections.. I've always gravitated to you, no matter how different we are. Is that why we're best friends? I don't know.. But, I've only realized this after two instances of us almost being separated forever, at least at the time.. Is that, I just don't wanna lose everyone again, not like my life before.. You, my bro.. Symbolize how I liked having true bonds with my friends, and no care for that lovey-dovey stuff, to others.. Especially when we first met, we may seem like a couple but.. we're just best friends, united in.. gaming.. haha.. Um, I get ya.. Having alone time is precious, so.. I'm going to leave. Oh and the speeches are about to end.. I think. Goodbye!" said Urda, as she left with a more happy expression than when she first saw Mijo.

"Haha.. Ok.. ok.. Just.. a lot... Ok, so.. Urda.. Urda.. Ok, I see.. My thoughts have been swirling around her but I realize.. yes.. Ok, we are good friends. That's good. She.. understands I guess. And for Rhida.. I don't know.. It's not done yet. If it was, she would've said so. She needs her private space, and so do I. I.. ok.. So, ok.. I can return to my seat." said Mijo as he starts walking back, hiding his emotions as he looks around the school.

He finally makes it to his seat, as the rest of his classmates clap at the end of the speech. He looks around to see Urda half-asleep, Rhida still gone, Ikari using her phone and Lauvielle talking to someone else. He feels a sense of relief but stays vigilant, wary of the situation unfolding.

Meanwhile at Rhida's spot at some benches that were near a school store. Rhida is seen crying to herself as she tries to keep herself composed to not draw attention to her. "Why.. why.. is he..? ugh... I.. can't believe it.. Is.. everything a lie? Was he just manipulating me? But.. why? I've never actually seen him laugh, and barely a smile or two.. He was always so.. numb? Like, he was a mixture of seriousness, coldness, or always on the verge of bursting to tears or anger.. D—did I do anything wrong? I don't know.. We never properly solved our issues during the fallout between the months.. always getting excuses to Jomi.. I was.. so distraught of myself to lie to Jomi, just so I don't see him. That.. deal? A way of me maneuvering so that I don't have to face him, but no matter what.. Ugh.. But.. even then.. I.. just wish that I got over it, one slip up and now I am trying to pursue someone that.. *gasp* *sigh* I.. is that.. forceful? I don't think so.. But, even then.. He's likely back to his seat, drinking away his sorrows.. He always told me that if he ever had a student night he would spend the night eating and drinking.. But, would he want a dance? Does he like to? I don't get it. He says he doesn't love me, but.. why do I always feel like he's looking at me while I am not.. I've talked to my friends, it seems that he doesn't divulge much to them too.. So, does he think it's one-sided? Does he want to reciprocate it? I.. don't understand how.. someone that you love and that they apparently love you, just.. doesn't? He doesn't hate me.. But, rather.. he's scared of me, because he's compassionate, and a selfless guy but.. he can often devolve himself and put too much to his back. I.. didn't know that this is how you break something up. But.. then again.. I can't just cry here... I have to talk to him. It was a shock to him, so he quickly defended and rationalized his attitude but.. it'd be better if dialogue happened. After all, it's a night of fun.. *sigh* But.. clearly the two of us aren't having fun, so.. one more talk. Then.. I can finally stop this tension and distance between us." said Rhida to herself as a lot of students pass by her. Then she decides to go back to her seat. She intentionally didn't look at Mijo's direction as she sat down.

"Good job with the exams, may your test scores be high and honor before excellence! God is good, all the time!" said the principal before he exited the stage. "That was a great speech by our great and honorable principal! Anywho, let the night start! The dance floor is now, officially open!" announced the announcer on the stage as the rest of the students start going to the dance floor, while pop music plays in the background.

"Oh it's starting. Well, time to go to the foods and drinks section. Hopefully they have the.. IntelC++ drinks, the orange and lemon ones.. specifically." said Mijo, as he stood up, got his bag and went to the school cafeteria, where they were selling a bunch of hotdog sticks and juice drinks. "Thank you." said Mijo as he paid ₱75 for a big hotdog stick and a bottle of IntelC++ lemon version.

He sat down near a couple of chairs and tables, and coincidentally Ikari was there, checking her phone. "Oh hey, what you doing here? I thought you had like.. someone to.." said Mijo, as he looked at Ikari with a sad expression. "Oh, nothing.. Just.. some broken friendships.. That's all.." sarcastically said Ikari, as Mijo became concerned. "O—oh? Uh.. That's.. really unfortunate.." said Mijo, now reflecting on the previous events. "Yeah, you don't know her though. We were best friends before, but.. well, I wanted to dance with her.. But, she.. had a different.. plan of her own." explained Ikari with a stern tone. "I see.. What are you doing now?" said Mijo, as he stood up and finished his food.

"I don't know.. You said to be vigilant so, I am staying here for at least a while.. But, whenever that happens, I guess I'll be ready." responded Ikari, as Mijo began drinking, then saying "Well, this could just be a.. normal day. Aside from the monster earlier. I am sure that, nothing will—" said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida coming to his position. "Will what? Look dude, every time you say that something bad happens.." remarked Urda, as Mijo stayed silent looking at Rhida.

"Oh hey guys! Ikari, Mijo! How's it been?" asked Lauvielle, as Mijo continued to ignore the others. "Terrible, how about you? You seem to have succeeded in your dance with Leviente." responded Ikari, as she pointed to Leviente speaking to his friends. "It's going well.. Not sure, what he's up to. 'One final time' he says. I am always not sure what his riddles and cryptic jokes always mean." answered Lauvielle, as she noticed Mijo's silence. "Hey Mijo, how about you? You won our bet. I 'danced' with him. Your 5₱.. next week? Hopefully before the end of the year.." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as he snapped out of his trance and Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah.. Haha.. That's what I call, 'motivation'."

"Well, how about that dark world danger that is constantly looming over us..? Any updates? Sorry, my phone's at like 16% so I don't want to open it.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari quickly responded, "If the others aren't stupid, there shouldn't be anything happening yet." as she checked her phone.

"Good, cause.. I have to talk to someone." said Mijo, as he points to Rhida approaching the group as Ikari and Lauvielle notice. "Ohh ok. Yeah imma go to the others, see you!" said Lauvielle as she left and Ikari responds, "Oh ok. I'll be alone here then." said Ikari, as she put on her earbuds to avoid eavesdropping.

"Hi, there.. What do you want..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked at him with a neutral expression, trying to hide her crying from earlier. "I.. want to talk about the.. love thing. Do you feel a—anything when you talk to me? Just, I need to know.." asked Rhida, as Mijo is trying to form his words properly. "I know you don't want me to go, but please.. this is the only way we can reconcile.." explained Rhida again, as Mijo is still thinking about what to say.

"Oh no.. Ah! Sorry.. But, Urda just sent an urgent message, there's a dark world opening at *the* place. You know what it is, come on. She said that magic is mixing into our world so we can use our weapons!" said Ikari, as she ran quickly to the ruins of the demolished area. "Of course.. Well.. let's go." remarked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they ran to follow Ikari.

"Hey! What are these guys doing here?! Isn't Jomi supposed to be like.. attacking the abyss monsters?! What are they doing here?!" shouted Urda, as the three arrived around the same time seeing monsters with blades and saws slowly rising from the ground. "I don't know?! I was honestly surprised by earlier! But now.." responded Mijo, as they all summoned their weapons to fight the monsters. "We have a chance." said Mijo, as he charged straight at the enemy as the rest followed and supported him with ranged attacks.

He sliced through the monsters with ferocious intent and the outpour of his emotions in his battle form is clearly shown as he battles a big abyss monster with two big shields in its hands. "Ice Shock!" shouted Rhida, as ice flew from her hands protecting Mijo from the rest of the abyss monsters. "My power is absolute!" said Mijo, as he dashed through space and slowed down time, striking the enemy with carefully placed slashes as he sheathed his blade, causing glass to shatter around him. "Mijo! You know that our ultimates—" shouted Urda as she shot her two pistols as fast as possible, while dodging around with the wind. "Yeah— I know.. But we don't need to last a long time, just enough for others to get here." responded Mijo, as he tried to focus on his movement. "Have you guys ever fought someone outside of the dark worlds?! It's.. rough!" said Ikari, as she tries to not die, as she  shoots her rifle at the enemy while running away against the other enemies.

"Once or twice.." answered Mijo, as he parried an attack from the big shield guy then he counterattacked with a jump to a mid-air plunge attack, knocking the big guy. "I am surprised that my—" said Mijo, before he was cut by the right part of his abdomen, knocking him back and his glasses to the ground. "Winter.. Storm!" shouted Rhida, freezing all available enemies as the others cleaned up. "Don't worry.. I am still here.. Just, a bit different!" said Mijo, as he regained his footing and put his glasses in his pockets, transforming to his other form. "They might break, but.. I got no choice... My power.. shall be absolute!" said Mijo, as he does his ultimate again, taking out all abyss monsters in the area including the big guy as he fell on his knees almost falling down, but managing to barely hold on.

"Mijo are you fine?!" shouted Rhida, as she went closer to Mijo. "Where are the others?!" questioned Ikari, as she also went to Mijo. "Watch out! Second wave!" shouted Urda, as monsters spawn around them and the abyss monsters managed to stab the other two, Rhida and Ikari. "Agh! What?!" screamed Ikari, as she was dragged by the blades of an abyss monster. "Ah! I—is this what pain.. feels like..?" said Rhida, as she was also dragged away by an abyss monster. "Mijo! Rhida! Ikari! Shit, shit.. I am trying to help! Hold on!" shouted Urda as she maneuvered around trying to get to the other three. "I.. need to help.. Agh! But.. why.." said Mijo, as he was wrapped around by random tentacles.

"I got you! Shit— Agh! Oof..." said Urda, as she was knocked by an abyss monster to the ground as she was near Mijo. "To live.. Ugh.. I must.. agh!?! What is this? I.. remember this.. abyss power.." said Mijo, as his energy was being corrupted by abyss magic. "I can't think straight.. My vision.. It knows.. it can't kill me, but.. ugh.. Ah..!" said Mijo as he tried to break out with little change. "Euphoria..? What.. is it doing..?" muttered Mijo, as his mind is swirling around, barely holding on to keep his sanity alive. "Ugh.. Just.. I guess.. this is worse.. than death..." said Mijo, as a mix of pleasure and dizziness took over his mind fully and he was dropped down by the tentacle abyss monster.

"Mijo? Mijo?!" said Urda, as Mijo is holding a sword that is not his, and with ripped clothes, almost like he was forcefully dragged by the monster to inject its magic. "Mijo? For the love of god.. Rhida and Ikari are here.. Don't.. kill us.." bargained Urda, as she prepared her blade for a potential fight. "What?! He really gonna turn on us now?!" said Ikari, as she was healed by Rhida. "N—no.. That's not him. He's.. *sigh* " responded Rhida, as the other two stood off. "That.. tentacle monster.. It's worse than trying to kill us, it's trying to **_corrupt_** us.. But.. How.. with him.." muttered Urda to herself, as she prepared her wind blades.

"Damn.. where the _fuck_ are the others?! We've been fighting for the past hour..! And now, fuckin Mijo is about to kill us!!" shouted Ikari as she tried to get up and run away. "Fuck this, I better get help. As I have already seen, he's gonna fuckin' kill us if he tries." said Ikari, as she runs from the place but then she gets stopped by an unknown barrier as she is knocked to the ground. "What? Fuck, we're dead.." said Ikari, as Rhida also notices that she hit a barrier that traps them in the area.

"N—no.. Then, what's happening with the others? If we're trapped since earlier, then we would've not been able to notice anything else happening outside.." remarked Rhida, as Mijo jumps to pluge on the group. "Watch out!" shouted Urda as she teleported near the others to deflect his plunge as he is knocked back on his feet. "These monsters, and Mijo.. We might have to defeat them.." said Urda, as she stood guard to protect Rhida, as Ikari quickly moved behind Urda, panicking internally. "Imma be real, we are not winning.." said Ikari, as she pointed her guns to the other monsters surrounding them. "But.. I am not dying like a bitch." said Ikari, as the other two also attacked the monsters, with Urda focusing at Mijo.

Urda clashed with Mijo, mirroring their spars. Mijo is the first one to strike by using dark magic to blast her back as a large strike, as she deflected it however she was pushed back by a bit. Then Mijo followed up with multiple slashes as Urda dodges easily and manages to get close to Mijo to attack him, but he blasted her away with dark magic, this time knocking her back from him by a lot. She got up and realized that the blast had damaged her clothes and was noticeably hurting more than normal. But she had to quickly focus at Mijo walking at her menacingly, as she ran to face him again. 

As she was about to clash blades with him, he suddenly dodges away from her and to Rhida. "What?! Hey!" shouted Urda, as she looks at Mijo surprise Rhida with an attack shattering her ice wall and knocking her back as Urda managed to get a hit on Mijo on his arm. He was unfazed then he knocked her back. "Don't worry! I got this!! FUUCK YOU!!!" screamed Ikari, as her gun overloads to launch a large flame projectile towards Mijo. As the flame engulfs it's surroundings, Ikari is slowly walking back from the destruction before being surprised by a seemingly fire-immune Mijo striking her, blowing her back to a wall knocking her down.

"Ugh.. Fuck.. Damn.. why did he had to be turned to the dark side.. I swear.. if any one of us were turned, it would've been quite easy.." muttered Ikari, as the flame dissipates, revealing the damage to the others due to their location near the explosive range. "Oh.. great. They're also damaged.. Huh.. can never.. seem to get it right.." remarked Ikari, as she looks at the other two on the ground. Mijo approaches her with  determined look as she looks over to him. "Hey.. is this the part where you kill me?! Just.. get it over with.. I am tired." said Ikari, as she looks at him, completely determined but clearly not in control, as his eyes now glow with purple. As he was about to raise his blade, Rhida managed to blast ice to Mijo, getting his attention. "H—hey! You'll not _ruin_ a single life anymore!" shouted Rhida as she was floating with ice all around her. "I might have been holding back, but Mijo wouldn't want us to, so.. this is.. ___WINTER STORM!"___ shouted Rhida as a blizzard from out of nowhere is summoned as Mijo focused at Rhida launching multiple slashes all being blocked by a huge ice wall.

"Ugh.. well.. fuck me.." muttered Ikari, as she layed down on the ground, seeing the impending doom. "Oh no.. This.. is not good.. She'll.. agh..!" said Urda as she tries to stumble her way to Rhida, but falling to the ground head first. "Ugh.. This.. is suicide. Hah, guess that's why they're a couple haha.. ugh.. Goodbye world.." said Urda as she stared at Rhida preparing her ultimate. "___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouted Rhida as she launched the blizzard freezing all living beings, as she drops down to the floor. "I.. can't believe it.. he's still.. *there.*" said Rhida, as she sees a Mijo covered in ice but moving towards her, walking slowly. "My.. power.. I.. ugh.. there's nothing else we can do.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with his blade pointed at her. As Mijo walks up to her, his blade maintained pointed at her, as she closes her eyes for the inevitability of death. But as she waited, she could feel no blade touch her, so she opened her eyes a bit to see his blade shaking. "What.. Is he.. hesitating..? Is he.. breaking out..?" remarked Rhida as she looks at his blade then to his eyes, noticeably the left eye was being turned blue from purple, but it was being turned back to purple, like his body and power is being fought by two parties, the corruption and Mijo.

Mijo walks back, as the blade is being turned towards himself. He struggles as he turned his blade towards his heart before stabbing himself. He falls to the ground, as Rhida calls out, "Mijo! NO! Please, please.. live..", while struggling to get to him. He's clearly in pain as he looks at the ground, trying to fight for his body back. "My Mijo.. come back.. Please.. I.. love you.. Ugh.." said Rhida to Mijo, as she succumbed to her injuries and fainted. As he witnesses her close her eyes, he reaches out before being forced back, holding the sword in his heart. He finally broke out as he stood up, but was knocked to the right of his position. He looks and sees a figure that looks similar to him but with the sword that is not his. "Who are you?!" said Mijo, as he manifests his sword out of nowhere with its scabbard. The figure then attacks him, but he dodges and slices the right abdomen of the figure. The figure stumbles as he retaliates with summoning slashes, as the figure reflects it to him, forcing him to dodge. "Like I said, who the fudge are you?! " questioned Mijo, as he summons small blades to attack the figure as he focuses on the figure before the figure gets behind him and manages to get a small cut before Mijo deflects and manages to get a huge wound on the figure's chest. The figure retreats from him and tries to heal themselves. The blizzard stops as the area becomes clearer as the other three remain unconscious, now being obvious to Mijo.

"**Explain yourself.** Who are you, and.. why do you exist?" said Mijo with spite, as the figure finally looks at him, revealing his face. "Oho.. A *doppelganger* huh? A corrupted version, well.. of course.." remarked Mijo, as he stares down at his doppelganger. "Your presence is only restricting us from **full power.** Give up, in your friends, lovers, everyone. You have killed them anyway, so.. *submit.* While you can." said the doppelganger with clear anger and madness. "What should I call you.. Jomi? No.. you don't deserve a name." said Mijo, mocking the doppelganger, as the doppelganger smiles and says, "No need. I'll call myself, ***Cara.*** We share a name, I am Mijo Cara."

"It's insane how you think you are me. You are not. 'Cara'? Really? Couldn't come up with an original name? Ok then, Cara.. Let's dance." said Mijo, as the two faced off, waiting for the other to attack first. "You are inherently weaker.. Your body is your transformation, and with us separate. You can no longer rely on yourself." said Cara, as he mocked Mijo, noticing his magic less powerful than what he expected it would be. "I'll still beat you, by myself. I only need my perseverance and will. You are nothing but an abyss monster pretending to be me." responded Mijo, as the two glared at each other intently. "Weakling. Pathetic. Scum." said Cara, as he attacked first, crossing blades with Mijo.

Mijo retreats and keeps a defensive stance as Mijo says to himself, "Damn it.. he's right.. This split is affecting me a lot, I can't use my magic properly.. While he seems to be unaffected.." as Cara smiles menacingly and attacks him, making him deflect but forcing him to lose further ground to the wall. "Damn. My offense is limited, I wonder if.. **they** can still fight?" said Mijo, as he intentionally starts hurling a bunch of slashes as he moves to the left to get to Urda. "What? Trying to revive your friends? Haha.. Even if you got all three, you would still succumb to me." said Cara, as he kept parrying his slashes.

"It doesn't hurt to try!" said Mijo, as he got to Urda, covered in snow and unconscious. "Oh it will.. Such is the way of the light." said Cara, as he stops attacking to see Mijo attempt to wake Urda up. "Stardust Crusader.. May you stand again and fight for yourself.." said Mijo, as he heals Urda, noticeably hurting himself in the process. "What is this.." questioned Mijo, as he continued healing Urda, persevering through the pain. "You'll see very soon.. Haha.." responded Cara, as Mijo finished and he walked back a bit as Urda woke up. "What.. Mijo? and.. Mijo?! Shit.. which one of you is the real one?!" questioned Urda, as she sees Mijo from the right and Cara to the left.

"No need. You shall see!" said Cara, as he quickly attacks her, forcing Mijo to defend her position, pushing Cara back, but weakening Mijo a bit. "Mijo?! Who the heck is that clone of yours?!" questioned Urda, as she stood up and summoned her weapons. "No clue. Just.. ugh.." said Mijo, before he fell to his knees, succumbing to the pain a bit. "Mijo?! Damn you whoever you are, so.. you've been the one hurting my friends?!" questioned Urda to Cara, as he laughs maniacally and says sardonically, "Haha!! Here I am.. Got a problem?" said Cara, as Urda jumps to attack him but Cara manages to reflect her, forcing her back on her feet. 

She ran to Mijo and said, "Mijo?! Are you fine?! Hold on, I have some—". before Mijo quickly rejects her potions of healing and says, "No.. go to the others.. And revive them instead. I'll handle him." said Mijo, as he stood up and was still shaking as he ran to attack Cara. "Got it." said Urda, as she ran to a nearby Rhida. He attacks Cara, as Cara easily defends and manages to push him back using a dark blast. "I'll fight.. my own path! You.. whoever you are.. shall *die!*" shouted Mijo, as he relentlessly attacked Cara, while Cara smiled all the way, not even trying sometimes. Meanwhile Urda is healing Rhida, and Rhida wakes up and asks, "Huh..? What.. happened?"

"Mijo is fighting his clone while I am trying to heal us back, you got any consumables with you?" answered Urda, as Rhida smiles and responds, "I—I think so.. Is.. Mijo going to be fine?", as she gives Urda some health snacks and drinks. "I.. uh.. to be honest.. I don't know. He's uh.. doing fine, but.. it's clear he's.. in pain, a lot. Like way too much, something that an emo person would dream of haha.." responded Urda, as she heals Rhida enough so she could stand up. "Uh.. I.. understand. Let's heal Ikari, then we'll help him." said Rhida, as they ran to Ikari's position. 

"My my.. Getting restless, are we?" mocked Cara, as Mijo maintained his battle stance, and responds, "Yeah, what about it? I am not giving up, ever." "Sure, sure.. You might not be giving up, but your magic, your ___power___ is fading.. It's only a matter of time hehe.. That is why I don't need to fight you. Then, my ***power*** is also increasing with it, like.. transfering the true authority to me." said Cara, as Mijo tries to focus at fighting but he knows that what Cara is saying is true. "Even so. My friends are here, and they hold no mercy for you. Especially when I am here." responds Mijo, as Cara maniacally laughs and says, "We shall see.. But we know the end. Your friends dead, disintegrated and you having to submit to me, **fully.**"

Rhida and Urda come up to Ikari and they heal her, "Woah! Ugh.. This.. is.. my weapon, and you two are Urda and Rhida.. Is this the afterlife?" asked Ikari, as the other two helped her get up. "No. You might even say it's still hell.." answered Urda, as she points to the duel between Mijo and Cara. "Oh! I see Mijo has broken out, but who is he fighting?" asked Ikari, as Rhida responds, "You'll know him. Let's help Mijo." as they ran to Mijo's position.

"Agh... Fuck.. I am so.. **angry** at you, but ugh.. no matter what, I can't win.." said Mijo, after getting knocked back by Cara as he easily outpowered Mijo when they crossed blades. "Haha.. That's it.. Embrace the anger, embrace it!" responded Cara, as he continued attacking Mijo, forcing Mijo to defend until a surprise attack from Urda caused Cara to retreat back. "You will stop hurting Mijo ___now!___" said Urda, as she glared down Cara with wind around her getting stronger. "Oho? Your friends are back.. that's nice.. Then.. this will prove our strength, we don't need anyone, haha." responds Cara, as he transforms his sword into a massive broadblade that is now filled to the brim with Mijo's and abyss magic. "*Let's dance.*" said Cara, as he laughs maniacally.

"*Golden Wind!*" said Urda, as she unleashed her ultimate, moving at lightspeed making Cara parry all her slashes, but now being vulnerable to the shots by Urda and her burning rock projectiles and Rhida's ice making his movement worse forcing him back. "Combined Assault? You learn that after your defeat? How pathetic, you were only a given second chance." said Cara, as he jumped in the air and headed for Ikari, forcing Urda to stop him mid-air using her wind, so that Ikari can charge her gun to fire a large burning projectile to knock him back to the ground. Then Rhida used her ice gain to restrict his movement, this time with an intense blizzard being directed to Cara. "Haha.. Even so.. You shall die!" shouted Cara, as he unleased his sword at light speed, making the other three easily hit by Cara, damaging the three of them. "I can use speed too, Urda! The best part? I only need to use it **twice.**" said Cara, as he smirked and stopped to look at the three getting up. 

"Ugh.. I can't take it.. anymore.. My mind wants to continue but my body is.. fading.." said Urda, as she looks at Cara standing there, looking at her. "Ugh.. I.. if I use.. it again.. I''ll not survive another day. He's.. right, ugh." said Rhida, as she heard Urda's words. "Whew.. I guess.. uh.. I am gonna die again, soo fun." responded Ikari to the other two, as she struggles to handle her gun due to her injuries. 

"I.. can't stay.. like this. I can't give up yet, there is a light that must be buried." said Mijo, as he stood up again, with pain and suffering at every second he remains determined and motivated. "Through vacant halls, I won't surrender!" shouted Mijo, as he ran to face Cara. "Oho? Stop in your fantasies, my Mijo.. I am sure we both know what's the outcome." responded Cara, as Mijo stopped and glared at him. "Forsakened, I am awakened.. ***I AM HERE TO RECLAIM MY NAME!***" said Mijo before charging straight at Cara, attacking and defending as much as he can, testing Cara a bit. "If you want the power, then come try and take it!" said Cara, as he defended against Mijo's barrage of attacks. "I will." answered Mijo, as he dodged and parried all attacks of Cara, with neither of them getting hits in each other. 

"Look.. He's still fighting.. I.. can't give up yet.. I must stay determined." said Urda, as she observes the battle and uses her powers to maintain her footing and launches herself into the air to unleash a barrage of slashes at Cara. "This is fun. No distractions—" said Cara, before getting hit by Urda. Mijo instantly attacks and manages to get a lot of hits before Cara manages to stop Mijo, but the damage was already done. "Ugh.. Of course.. only when you get your so-called motivation, you get a few hits.." said Cara, before Mijo followed with a barrage of slashes forcing Cara to dodge.

"Ah? Is that.. Urda? and.. Mijo? I.. have to.. help them. No matter what happens, even if.. ugh.." said Rhida, as Ikari stood up and shouted, "Hah! You're getting beat by the power of friendship! It starts with this!" as she blasted Cara with a lot of burning projectiles like arrows, rocks and bullets, all headed to Cara. "I.. hmmm.. Let's do it." said Rhida, as she looks at Cara, struggling to maintain his health as he dodges the attacks from the other two while trying to parry and counter attack Mijo's attacks. "Here it goes.." she says, as she looks at Mijo another time. "I am sorry.. ___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouts Rhida, as she floats and her eyes turn white as a huge blizzard starts forming.

"Oh no.." said Urda as she witnessed Rhida charging her ultimate. "Huh? Wow.. ok..?" reacted Ikari, as she looked at Rhida floating with wind and snow swirling around them. Mijo looks at Rhida and realizes what he has to do. "A storm is approaching.. There's only one thing I should do. **_I shall be the storm that is approaching._**" declared Mijo, as he used the last of his lightning magic to influence the blizzard causing it to be even more extreme and chaotic than ever before.

"What a show.. Let's see if it pays off.. Hah?" said Cara, as he looks at the huge blizzard and thunderstorm mix slowly forming. "Huh?! Mijo?!  What are you—" said Rhida, as she noticed Mijo influencing the storm. "Do it, now!" shouted Mijo, as he's barely holding the storm and himself together. "Ah— Ok!" responded Rhida, as she unleashed the blizzard-storm mix, decimating everything in its path as everything is swallowed inside as everyone's vision fades to black.

Mijo wakes up in a familiar dark space, with a figure in front of him turned their back so familiar yet different. "What.. happened?" asked Jomi, as he recognizes her voice and is relieved as he stands up again. "I.. uh.. honestly.. I don't know.. I was.. too busy with my.. I mean— the party, to figure out anything happening.. I just followed my heart, and my mind.. So many things happened in the blink of an eye.. I am.. overwhelmed." answered Mijo, as he sat down on the floor, contemplating.

"You're lucky again, y'know? After hearing that, I.. am not surprised by what I saw. Did you know you were fighting in the dark world? That _abyss doctor_.. He found a way to.. disrupt our life **again**." explained Jomi as she turned to face Mijo, revealing her tattered and battered look, seeing as her clothes were cut and torn due to battle. "What.. happened..? to you, I mean." asked Mijo as she looked somewhere else, looking conflicted. "I.. think we should focus on you first. Let me set a scene, me and my guards saw three bodies and traces of abyss magic. Who were you fighting, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo tries to remember the  chaotic events earlier.

"Uhuh.. Well.. mm... They were definitely abyss monsters. They seem organized and controlled by someone, likely a subordinate of the _doctor_.." answered Mijo, as he remembers the previous events and is intentionally choosing his words. "I see.. It's as expected.. So, tell me.. Mijo, why do the most concentration of abyss magic trace back to **you?**" questioned Jomi, with her eyes narrowed to Mijo's trying to not look at her. "Uh haha... Uh.. it's a long story.. I'd prefer if we do not discuss it." responded Mijo, as Jomi unsheathed her sword to point it at Mijo, as Mijo walks back a bit and looks at a Jomi, who now has a more tense facial expression. "Explain yourself, or else." said Jomi, as Mijo held back his magic to not provoke Jomi and answered, "I.. ugh.. It.. starts with right after I went home." as Jomi sheathes her sword and says, "Go on."

"Well.. All I can say is, you know that.. potion you gave me? I decided to *sigh* experiment a bit.. after making I sure was alone, it was.. a strange feeling. It wasn't normal, I don't think any type of transformation can make you.. uh.." explained Mijo, before struggling to say the words that won't make him look worse. "What..? Say it. We're the only two here. Here's the thing, since you.. with your amazing magic used something, and now.. you're pretty much the only one like.. **'dead'** as in.. your friends are fine, however due to the insane use of magic during that battle they're knocked out, at least for now.. I can.. heal them, but.. I need to know the details first." interrupted Jomi, as Mijo was shocked at these words and remarked, "Huh..? I am dead? Like.. for real? Is this my dying consciousness or something?"

"No. *sigh* To be honest, you were about to die when I saw you three. Your body has been beaten so many times, more than the others actually. It doesn't help that your transformation glasses have been broken, likely in the battle. I am.. keeping you alive, as always. I knew that you were most likely the biggest catalyst of any potential surge of intense magic, at least.. not abyss ones." answered Jomi, as Mijo was relieved and responds, "Whew.. I.. survive another day. Uh.. want me to continue?" as Jomi nods and Mijo continues, "Well, the 'horny' effect." before Jomi snickered and commented, "Oho? Really..? The first thing you did was to.. touch yourself like a pervert? Y'know.. That indirectly says something about your attitude to transformation and me."

"Ugh.. I really didn't want to tell you now, but.. it's important, I swear!" explained Mijo, as Jomi keeps giggling a bit and remarks, "Is it..? Haha.. It's not like I don't know your preferences, but it's still funny to me whenever you admit it, like.. the so many times that you accidently say things about it.. Haha.." as Mijo blushes at the embarassment but continues, "A—anyways.. About the effect¸ it is the same thing when.. *sigh* we got beaten by the abyss monsters."

Jomi raised her eyebrows and asked, "Woah? You got defeated, big surprise.. But, whoever was your enemy.. They got defeated, right?" as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah.. I'm just going to say it, I was corrupted by the abyss." before Jomi raised one of her eyebrows, questioning what she had just heard. "Huh.. I am starting to get the picture.. Did you wield the abyss sword we found?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo expressed disappointment at himself.

"I.. Yes. I did. I.. basically got influenced by whatever they did to me that had the same effect, I also broke out of it and fought this manifestation of my corrupted form named.. Cara, you know something about it, Jomi? Considering our.. connection?" answered Mijo, as Jomi thought about it for a while, perusing her mind for an answer. "Hmm, I've always thought something about a third version of you appearing, but.. I've always thought it would be when the abyss doctor introduces them.. It's just a theory though, and.. this explains why I was also weakened a bit during my.. expedition. I have to confirm this, but my theory is that there's a light and dark version of each individual, it was simply a coincidence that we met first. But due to the nature of abyss magic, perhaps it can make more copies but is less sane and more unstable. It also probably takes any magic it can find, and I also happen to control some abyss magic for myself."

"Wow.. I agree. But only because I know as much in the dark world as I do in school, absolutely almost nothing. Even If I do, only a  grain of rice.." responded Mijo, as Jomi quickly comments, "Well, I don't know about that one.. You seem less confident than ever previously due to learning a lot of info about stuff in a week followed by weeks of normalcy. It's fiine. I am literally you, and you are me, it is that simple." 

"Yeah yeah. I know.. No need to remind me, actually.. I just.. have a lot to think about. L—lets continue." said Mijo, as he stops for a moment to recollect his thoughts before continuing, "So to fight this abyss monster, we had to launch a powerful blizzard—thunderstorm attack, and amplified by **my** use of my friend's magic, I didn't realize it but then I saw that I was also grabbing aero and fire magic to mix in, resulting in the most chaotic, destructive and powerful storm I've ever seen.." explained Mijo, as Jomi stayed silent for quite a while, before responding, "I see.. I think I get it now. Hmm, it seems that the **_abyss doctor_** was targeting you. To make sure he succeeded, he distracted me. Then he attacked your party, surprising you at your weakest, and by doing this he can gain control of a powerful enemy, as well as weaken a strong one. He's likely testing something, again. All we can do is to prepare for the worst."

"Uh.. when will he do something again?" asked Mijo as Jomi quickly responded, "I don't know. I saw signs of his presence but he wasn't present for the battles. Just.. enjoy the rest of your night." as Mijo stood up and questioned, "Cool, how do I revive again?" before Jomi answered, "Stay here. I'll leave and revive you fully, you're going to wake up in the dark world though, you need to close the fountain first."

"Oh yeah, well.. see you, Jomi." responds Mijo, as Jomi nodded and opened a portal as she looked at him one more time before heading out. Then as he looked around, suddenly he couldn't stop himself from dropping to the floor, as he woke up and saw the dark fountain. He looked around to see Jomi healing the other lightners, as he looked back at the dark fountain.

"I guess, I should close it then." muttered Mijo to himself as he went near the dark fountain and closed it as light took over his vision. He woke up at the light world laying down at the ruins of the building they went to. His transformation is still there, however due to the battle, his glasses are more scratched up and are more prone to breaking fully. He stands up, noticing that his body was more weak when he entered and he quickly wore his glasses, before looking at his friends, all slowly waking up. 

"Hey.. So.. the abyss threat has been neutralized for now, Jomi arrived to support us and we can finally rest for today." said Mijo, as the other three acknowledge Mijo's words in various nods and hums. "Oh, finally.. Damn that girl took a while, how about the others, Lauvielle.. JR?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle, Leviente, Jamise and JR arrived at their location. "We're here! Uh.. where's the enemy?" said Lauvielle, as Mijo, Rhida, Ikari and Urda look at her.

"You guys arrived late, we.. dealt with it." responded Urda, as the newly arrived lightners all express forms of disappointment. "Woah no way.. We fought through hundreds of monsters, and.. huh? Our weapons, they just disappeared?!" said Jamise, as she realizes her wooden staff is gone as all the others notice their weapons couldn't be summoned anymore.

"Oh, right. We were flashed by a huge light before getting our footing and going here. That's probably the closure of the dark world we fell on." explained JR. "Mhmm.. All we saw and heard was a huge explosion, we assumed that was the dark world and started heading but then we saw a bunch of abyss monsters appear around us, we couldn't leave the unconscious people be potentially threatened so we stayed to fight them." added Leviente, as the others processed the statement, "Although, they seem that they were targeting us.. It's weird, why didn't they get dark world magic?" commented Jamise, as she narrowed her eyes a bit.

"This was a bit different than normal dark world explosions, but it hasn't been the same since the intramurals.. Maybe the ***abyss order*** are trying something different?" responded Mijo. "There's nothing we **can** do anyway. Mijo mentioned that as of right now, the ***abyss*** can't and likely won't do anything, at least.. according to Jomi." remarked Rhida, as the various ligthners agree at Rhida's statement, some more happy than the others. "Well, at least we got to fight. I see that as a win!" exclaimed Jamise, her enthusiastic energy being recieved by others differently, ranging from that same excitedness to a slight amusement at her statement. 

"Well, I guess that's that.. I am sure y'all have your own things to do, so the world is *saved!* again.. see you. " said Mijo, before everyone separates from the group, with only Rhida staying behind. "So.." said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida looking at some rocks, averting his gaze. "Uh.." continued Mijo, trying to come up with a word to say to Rhida as she stays silent. "*sigh* Answer the question, Mijo." said Rhida, as she finally gets the courage to look at Mijo again trying to keep a neutral face. "I.. I know. *sigh* Look, I.. I am sorry, ok? I just.. can't express love the same way you do. But, to answer.." he stops for a moment, then continues, "Yes. I do. Very much. But.. I can't help myself, I've never really experienced those types of relationships, nor do I have a natural affinity with them. I uh.. have been considering why I have these problems, but.. hmm.. It might be because I haven't experienced it myself, or genetics.. Either way, what I am trying to say is.. I am.. trying, as much as I can."

They are both silent for a minute or two, before Rhida responds, "Ah.. I see..  *sigh* I'd kinda wish that everytime we saw each other we had a fun time.. However, before the dark world.. We'd **never** interact much, I— I don't know why, I just wanted to both connect but at the same time I didn't really know you much, besides your reputation as a computer expert... I just knew that I had something for you; I'd first hide it.. But often, love gets discussed, so they get.. **revealed**. Soon enough, they'd push me to you, trying to help me overcome my fears and talk to you.. But, nothing really came of it.. I had a few **scares** actually. But it seemed that everytime we talked it was always small and.. like we were just.. classmates. The other times, it seems like you were intentionally trying to get my attention or were standing next to me but then leaving. But.. I'm not the one to pry into anyone's secrets.. I don't know if you remember this, but before the dark world, we had a.. few interactions, that.. genuinely **scared** me that you didn't **reciprocate**.. I am not sure.. what you thought since you were always casual with these things. Since.. school was ending, I was ready to move on but, soon after.. the dark world happened. And, in the following days of that whole starting point, I quickly became attached, especially that first time in that snowy world. Then the feats we did, the accomplishments you boasted, it was.. a **rekindling**. But, after that fateful last day.. I.." she stops herself as she held back tears. Mijo went to her side to comfort her, before he went back after she calmed down a bit.

"I.. couldn't bear you **dying**, and even if you didn't, we would've likely been separated in the future. I.. just.. had to confess right there, before the major battle. But, you looked conflicted, I was.. **horrified** that you were going to reject me but, you just left.. without saying anything. Afterwards, we didn't meet and I didn't see you for quite a while. Even during the next school year, you intentionally avoided me and my presence, it wasn't until the intramurals where we got our first proper conversation, even then.. It was so **short**, it didn't do **anything**. So, now we're here.." continued Rhida, as Mijo listened intently hiding his reactions for now. 

"I see. It wasn't the **best** way to say goodbye, but it made sense at the time.. *sigh* I can't **justify** that. After that I couldn't look at you the same way again.. It was embarassing, if I looked at you.. even for a second.. If I did, there was a chance you would look at me, and I.. was.. a coward.. I'd wish that all those times, I just.. manned up and all of it will be solved.. But, like you said we're here. And we might as well enjoy this night." responded Mijo, then he went up to her and hugged her as she did the same, both of them holding each other tightly for quite a while before they pulled back.

"Ok.. ok.. Now uh.. we're done with the emotional stuff.. Let's.." said Mijo, now smiling and relieved.  "Dance? Hehe, as much as I wanted to, I.. don't actually know how to.." responded Rhida, as Mijo chuckled and said, "Me too.. I was planning to drink tons of IntelC++ drinks, if you want to join me, that would be nice."

"I.. would love to, I personally love the pomelo and calamansi flavors." answered Rhida, before they walked out of the area and to the foods and drinks section of the party. They silently marveled the aesthetics of the party, as they silently enjoyed each other's company, getting looks from some of their classmates. They finally got to the place and begin ordering, Mijo and Rhida paying ₱75 and ₱50 respectively. Mijo got a hotdog stick and the orange flavor while Rhida got the pomelo flavor.

They sat down nearby, where Ikari was still checking her phone, where Mijo placed his bag near a bunch of tables. "So.. anything to talk about?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was drinking the juice quietly. "Uh.. no not really.. next exams are far away.. and, research too.. so.. I just.. want to forget about those for a while." responded Rhida, with a sad expression.

"How.. about the results of the current ones, I mean there's two quarters left, but.. eh.. I don't really know what to talk about either." asked Mijo, as he drank more juice. "Uh.. I did good, around 91 average for most of my subjects.. I know uh.. you tend to place lower.. so I didn't want to brag about it." answered Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her statement. "Eh.. You know I don't care much about grades, but I do admit, I do ask other's grades for.. I have no idea, envy? jealousy? motivation?" responded Mijo, as Rhida looked at Mijo. "It's.. natural curiosity.. I guess..." remarked Rhida, before looking away as the two fell silent eating and drinking respectively. 

For a moment, they were listening to the music playing while gazing at the crowd of dancers at the dance floor. They each were thinking of something but they didn't want to share it to the other one. "Ahem.. What's the time.. hehe..?" asked Mijo as he checked himself the time to see it was 21:00 (9:00 PM), an indication of time that is running out. "It's.. 9:00 PM, why do you ask?" questioned Rhida, anticipating something. "Uh.. ok.. so.. why don't we **try** dancing, at least during this night..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and stumbles her words a bit before answering, "Uh.. haha.. uh.. sure..?" as they finished up their meal and decided to go to the dance floor.

They went to the dance floor, holding hands as they looked at the others. Mijo placed his left hand at her right shoulder as he placed his right on her hip, as she does the opposite, right on left and right on his hip. They awkwardly started to sway from side to side as they figured what to do. 

"Uh.. so.. is this how it's done?" asked Mijo, as Rhida shakes her head, not knowing if they are right. "Um.. Well, I don't think.. we.. fit this.." continued Mijo, as they continued their dance. Rhida nods, but they remain swaying left and right. "Y—yeah.. Um.. do you want to continue..?" asked Mijo as they slowly stopped.

"W—why did we.. stop..?" asked Mijo, as he pulled his hand away from Rhida as she does the same. "Hmmm.. I just, have doubts.. about this whole thing.." answered Rhida, as Mijo sadly nodded in agreement, not surprised by her answer. They silently went off the dance floor and went back to their drinks as they sat down together.

"*sigh* Well, I was.. thinking about it. I just.. didn't want to push it, we might as well enjoy this night right?" said Mijo, as Rhida nodded her head, silently agreeing with his statement. "But.. yeah.. it's only a couple of hours before we go home. And.. afterwards? I am not sure. This is.. one of the only few times we get to meet each other. Even in the dark world, we don't meet.. Eventually, after grade 10.. we might never meet each other again.." continued Mijo, making Rhida start to tear up.

"I.. *sigh* you don't know how much I wanted you, nor have I ever tried to express it.. But, I still love you, however.. life likes to separate us.  And..it... agh.. hurts me to say this.. But.." he sighs heavily and begins to stumble on his words. "b—but.. I—I t—think.. w—we.." he fails to make a word as he instead tries to comfort Rhida's emotional turmoil.

"Mmm... I.. *sigh*  I.. guess I shouldn't— It's ok.. Rhida, please.." said Mijo, as Rhida starts to cry harder. "*sigh* I am.. sorry.. I am just.. going.. to shut up now." continued Mijo as he tears up a bit but not letting much show, focusing on Rhida instead.

They were comforting each other for a while, focusing on each other while everything around them moves. Ikari is awkwardly shuffling away from them, trying not to disturb the broken couple, while the others were focused on their own nightly escapades. Eventually Mijo decided to speak u

"Ok.. ok.. so.. mmm.. I.. think we should still.. be together, but understand that.. we might not get a lot of opportunities to be together. Let's make it last until then, you.. good with that?" asked Mijo, as Rhida calmed down a bit and answered, "Mmm.. Yes, yes I am good with that. Haha.."

"Haha, now... Let's.. oh.." said Mijo, before Mijo noticed Ikari go to their spot, with a shy grin. "So.. Hopefully, I wasn't interrupting anything.. But, new dark world just dropped, oxygen room." said Ikari as Mijo and Rhida checked their phones and saw Urda's message at the group chat.

Urda: yooo @everyone I am just about to make another dark world so hopefully you can join me in fighting some abyss monsters!!!! Don't worry this one is made by me so no confusing transitions justtt enter the room!

"Oh. well, ok then. Come on, let's go." said Mijo as the other two followed him to Urda's section classroom. "Well, here goes nothing." muttered Mijo before jumping in with the others, transforming their night wear with a more elegant and battle look, as they landed in a classroom.

"Oh, this is a.. classroom, interesting." remarked Mijo before noticing their new look. "Oh right. Mmm.." says Mijo, as the three of them checked each other's new looks. "Oh wow... I have.. a cool ice queen aesthetic. I even have a diamond tiara!" commented Rhida, as Ikari adds, "Hmm.. I have a.. you know what, it just looks cool to me, ok?"

"We should go outside, Urda's probably waiting for us.." said Mijo before he went outside, the other two following him. Then they notice Urda leaning on the wall beside the door with a gray kimono, a black haori coat and red hakama pants, with maple leaf designs all around.

"Oh? You're finally here. Because.. I've been waiting! I can't just let my friends have no fun in killing some abyss monsters!" exclaimed Urda, point to some abyss monsters nearby as Lauvielle and Leviente appear behind Urda and Rhida. Mijo turns around and notices the two before looking back at Rhida and responding, "Yeah. Let's go." as they headed off to where the monsters are, with Jamise and JR joining.

"Hold on, let me make a videogame reference.. *ahem*" said Mijo, as he looks at the monsters with his sword positioned to slash through them. "Devils cry, huh? Well, let's hear what that sounds like!" continued Mijo, before stabbing the nearby monsters, alerting the horde.

As the others summon their weapons and begin killing the abyss monsters, Mijo goes near Rhida and says, "Well.. I guess our fate was to stay/night?" as Rhida is unamused by his reference and responds, "Hmm.." then Rhida looks at the monsters, she smirks and continues, "Well, I guess we should have unlimited blade works then." as Mijo smiles and nods as they continue the fight.

## Author's Note:

Hello hey hey I've been in major rewriting territory since like.. last month..? So, there hasn't been major spinoffs, at least not from the main series (been doing some small here and there chapters in the Mizo/Rika saga) but now..? WELL I'M BACK BABY!!

I promise that this has been thought of and was outlined during Feb. 14 2025, actually writing it though..? Yeah, if you see a couple of days afterwards, of course, writing a chapter takes a while, you know. But, if you read it, you'll see it makes sense why I got it during that day. Anyways, enjoy!

_Let us see a tale, a tale as old as the day of celebration it was based on, 'Dia de San Valentín' or in English terms, 'Valentine's Day'.. A tale of what goes on during this particular day, a tale of love, but.. in different ways.. of course._

"You know Mijo, if you keep trying to hunt down that one last pearl in that drink, you might accidentally choke and your throat starts acting up." said Rhida, as Mijo nodded. "Well, it's just, where am I supposed to use this? I already drank most of the iced coffee I ordered, so the things left are square ice and pearls, which I'm trying to eat." responded Mijo, while still trying to get the pearls through the purple plastic straw. "Maybe you shouldn't have drank it all when we went up here.. I still have mine half, and it's just regular milk tea boba." said Rhida, as she sipped her drink.

"Ah? Well, I suppose you're just less addicted than me. I like coffee so much, even getting a large isn't enough. Hmm, do you think those loyalty points by the store will get me something?" replied Mijo, as Rhida thought about it. "Loyalty points? Maybe if you buy everyday, haha. Like a starbucks addict, oh yeah, I can see you being one. Ah, such a shame there's no coffee shop here, only iced drink shops with toppings like that." said Rhida, as Mijo started drinking the ice and eats it.

"I've always wondered why you're so fixated on consuming **all** of the drink, I mean, it's just some ice and pearls, if there's no drink to drink, just throw it away." asked Rhida, as Mijo continued. "It's important to maximize use of product, I mean.. I was kinda thirsty, since my water tumbler ran out, so this is just.. technically quenching my thirst?" Rhida, then looked at her own tumbler then at Mijo. "I could've just bought you some flavored juice or just plain ol' water from the canteen or **the** shop in the school, y'know. I'm not that.. busy, well, after the morning at least." said Rhida, as Mijo looked up and looked at Rhida directly.

"Hey hey.. Uh, I kinda forgot the whole afternoon existed. It was like.. okay, so in the morning I was chilling, and recovering from the sickness since last week, and I sat by just watching the whole uh.. event. Then afterwards, it was just.. like some random stuff, yeah.. Don't remember much, I think I was just playing some tactical strategy game on my phone while the whole afternoon blazed around, before I met up with you. So, yeah.. I kinda forgot you existed.. Sorry, by the way." said Mijo, as Rhida sighed and smirked a bit. "Don't be, as if I wasn't busy with friends and other matters during that time too. A lot of like.. love jail, some.. marriage game, then.. a lot of 'haranas'.. It kinda blurred as I went around with my friends, of course... they begged me the whole way through, I.. uh.." responded Rhida, as she put her hand on her chin.

"Yeah, we're not there yet?" said Mijo and Rhida at the same time. "Mhm. I know we're both shy when it comes to these types of stuff, didn't want to just make it so.. obvious, oh right. Yeah, the reason we're here. The.. Valentine's day." continued Rhida, as Mijo lightened up in his eyes. "Hey hey, I might not be obvious, but I.. have a gift for you, just a little payback from you giving something to me." said Mijo, as he grabbed some small box from his backpack. "H—huh..? Hey, wait.. Is that a—" asked Rhida before she saw the box open, it's just a small little letter 'R' with an 'M' being bonded to it by a small heart chain. "Oh.. awww..." said Rhida as she took the gift with a blush. "I get it, thanks! Thank you. I'll wear it right now, just so that you can see me wearing it, just like you do." said Rhida, as she put it in the same attachment as her I.D., like Mijo.

"Hey, wait.. I just noticed, why isn't the little round thing attached to your uh, lanyard?" asked Rhida, as Mijo looked at it then at her, with a smirk. "I was.. uh.. kinda hoping you noticed that to be honest.. Uh, it broke during the 3rd day of exams, don't know why, but it did. So I'm just wearing it like this now." said Mijo, as Rhida chuckled. "Well, I suppose I'm the only one that would notice.." added Rhida, as the two got closer. "Oh! Uh.. I don't really have any.. hey! Actually, um.. as a celebration, can we just.. go to the store.. over there, below? Look, uh.. it might not be a surprise now, but I'd feel a bit.. bummed out if I also didn't give you something, even if it isn't a keychain like this.." said Rhida, before dragging Mijo to the ground floor of the super mall they were at.

"Oh? What are you getting me then..?" asked Mijo as Rhida slightly blushed again. "It's a small thing, I'd think you like it.." answered Rhida, as they go inside and head straight to the pillow section. "Oh? A pillow..? Is it..?" said Mijo, before Rhida grabbed a small pillow, enough to lay your head in, it has a pink background and unicorn design on it. "Aww.. It's cute~" commented Mijo, as Rhida blushed and giggled. "Yeah! That's.. that's why I picked it, haha.." responded Rhida, as she then took a look at her wallet. "H—huh?! Ay.. uh.. I don't have.. well.. besides from.."

Rhida blushed intensely, as she took out her phone and got her 'special' money note. "Is that.. a 100₱ bill? It looks normal, why do you have it?" asked Mijo as Rhida looked at Mijo with a shy grin. "Um... I don't spend what you give me.. you know, when you gave me that 100₱ as a 'gift'? I still have it.. it's this one.." said Rhida before looking down in embarrassment. "Ah.. I see. Well, if you just need 100₱, I can give it, but.. I explicitly allow you to spend it, so it's not stuck in your phone case like a framed photo of us." said Mijo, with a slight grin as he gave her a 100₱ bill as they got to the counter.

"Ah?! I.." Rhida then turned to the cashier and gave her money as the transaction was processed and the pillow put into a branded plastic bag. She was silent the entire time as Mijo watched her, then they moved out of the store.

"T—thanks for that, I guess.. But uh.. just remember to bring it with you, every time we meet, okay? I.. well, no guarantee, but.." Rhida smirks as she looks at Mijo. "I'd be more inclined to.. lay near your lap." Mijo smiled and kissed her on her forehead. "Okay then, I'll be bringing it with me, Ri-ri~ " said Mijo, as Rhida smiled and she blushed slightly. "You.. ah.. yeah." said Rhida before looking over to some group of people Rhida recognized. "Hey, why don't we watch them? I have a feeling something big is happening." said Rhida, as Mijo noticed the people Rhida is looking at; Mizo, Rika and Kari. "Oh yeah, that friend group. Welp, I like doing that anyway, let's hide out somewhere~" said Mijo, as Rhida grabbed him to look chill as they observed the group.

_Switching perspectives..._

"Fine.. fine..! Don't push me, Kari.." said Rika, as she looked at Mizo's back. "Oh? Rika?" said Mizo as he turned around and saw Rika intensely blushing. "Rika~ Show it, show him~" said Kari, as she pushed Rika closer, accidentally making Rika hold Mizo's shoulders, and now they're very close. "Ah?! Damn you, ahh... Mizo, here. It's.. it's just.. a small gift of our.. uh.. friendship, okay..?" said Rika, as she gave him a small plushie keychain of a pikachu. 

"Aww..? That's cool~! Actually." said Mizo, as he takes the gift and attaches it to his I.D. and then booped Rika on the head as he was really close to kissing her. "H—hey!! Stop that.. Mnn?" said Rika before Mizo kissed her on the lips fully, Rika was initially surprised, before she could process it Mizo pulled back and patted her on the back. "You wanted that, right?" asked Mizo, as Rika was now blushing intensely. "Sh—shut up.. I.. just.. just hey where's your gift then? Hah?" asked Rika, as Mizo smirked and grabbed a small ring with a purple heart on top of it.

"Here. I think it fits you, oh don't worry about me, Rika.." said Mizo, as he gave the ring to Rika. He then pulled out a copy of the ring and wore it. "H—hey.. T—this feeels like a marriage proposal without the marriage part.." said Rika, as she wore the ring anyway. "That's.. the point~!" answered Mizo as he compared their rings in their fingers. "O—okay, fine.. This is.. nice, I guess." said Rika as Mizo smiled and made Rika look at him again. "So? What do you think, love?" said Mizo, developing into a smirk as Rika blushed intensely and pushed him away a bit. "H—hey! I.. stop teasing me, jeez.. I said it's nice. A nice gift for two best friends, yeah.." said Rika as she sighs and looks at Mizo's eyes. "I appreciate it though. Thanks." said Rika as she smiled before Mizo hugged her and then pulled back before she could process it.

"Eh?? Hey..! You keep teasing me with these.. acts and I might just start doing them myself, hmph~~!" said Rika, as she playfully pouted when Kari returned from whatever she was doing. "Oh? You guys done? I'm guessing a lot of kisses and hugs, but I don't need to know that. Come on, we still have so many things to do, maybe more memories, ehe~" said Kari, as she dragged Rika with her while Mizo chuckled and followed.

_Into the Dark, where a certain princess in the dark is inside her bedroom.._

*The Sacred War - Soviet Union is playing..*

Jomi is wearing a soviet army uniform, specifically Zhukov's, without the medals, they're too cumbersome for her. "Вставай страна огромная..." mumbled Jomi as she played a massive war tactical game, where she controls a Soviet Union fighting against a Fascist Germany controlling most of Europe, including Britain. "Идёт война народная,
Священная война!" muttered Jomi, as she moved units from left to right, defending against the invader while also controlling them, basically, she's roleplaying as the Soviet Union while making sure the Germans don't instantly die. "Пусть ярость благородная, Вскипает как волна!" said Jomi, as she continued to repulse the invaders through intense tank management and anti-air attacks. 

"Princess?" asked Anastasia, as Jomi suddenly froze up and turned off the music. "H—huh?! Oh.. uh.. Anastasia? Yeah, uh.. what?" asked Jomi, as she looked at Anastasia embarrassed. "Umm.. the Valentine's day preparation you asked us to do, they're.. going well, and I just wanna show them to you, as the main organizer.. Oh, Sasha will be joining us as well.." said Anastasia as Jomi nodded. "Oh, yeah. That... Um, do I have to though? I'm.." said Jomi before looking at her massive wargame. "..kinda busy, hehe.." continued Jomi, as Anastasia nodded.

"You don't have to, princess, but.. you have been busy these past few week inside the castle, and now might be a great time to explore and chat with the locals and the country, especially on a day like this.." said Anastasia, as Jomi sighed and nodded. "Alright, fine.. I get it. Um, I'll be ready in.. uh, I'll be ready soon." said Jomi, before Anastasia nodded and closed her door.

"Ah.. I'll.. be.. um.. gah!! So embarrassing, didn't remember to lock the door... Well, I didn't need to, since.. well, I trust my subordinates, I just.. well, damn it.." said Jomi to herself as she tidied up her room, and saved the wargame for later. "This uniform.. man.. It's so.. this one's the more.. winter-based models.. I guess I based it off one, but.. like, I kinda made it myself, since.. gosh, those medals will be heavy if I put them on.. This one's probably more comfy than the real thing, but eh, we have magic here, it suits it." said Jomi, as she commented on the clothes while switching to her 'going outside' clothes which are just a simple purple dress with attachments of sword hilts, belts and other assortments of cloth to have better protection against small threats and the cold environment.

"The music.. it's soo good!! I wish I can do something like this, but uh.. I.. um... about like almost half of the like post 1930s music in that light world can't be made here, the tech doesn't exist yet because, we just steal from them and then play them, and.. if remixes are a thing, magic is used, so.. no like big instruments or something.. maybe I should put that down in a checklist, since.. it's kinda my fault for that too." commented Jomi, as she looked through her selection of music that includes; Soviet patriotic music, communist songs, and anarchist songs.

"Though this one's the.. political set, I have the.. Nirvana set, Linkin Park set, and that System of  a Down set at that closet over there, but yeah.. I uh.. had to use this one for.. reasons.." added Jomi, before she tidied herself up with some last minute cleaning up of herself in the mirror before going out of her bedroom.

"Anastasia! Sasha! I.. uh, it's been a while since we met like this, haha.. Usually it's just been boring government work yeah?" said Jomi to the other two as Anastasia nods. "Yes, princess.. the fact that we get to chill for this day, is a blessing in disguise." said Anastasia as they walked out of the castle. "So what's been happening, in the Dajovy City? Any personal developments I want to know about?" asked Jomi as Anastasia nudged Sasha to answer.

"Oh, uh.. well, it's same as usual, Jomi.. It's not like anything changed a lot more differently these past few weeks.. Uh, Chief Vlad and Doc Natascha are still doing their thing, being platonic parters, taking care of that orphanage.. and the org.. Um, Polina and Misha are doing their family stuff... Uh, yeah, I think that's.. all I remember. Um, look, Dajovy is the all-in-all city anyway, and I really don't care about other stuff, and.. yeah, nothing new from those people." explained Sasha as Anastasia nodded. "I can confirm that, I don't think there has been any significant change around these parts, however.. how about the Scians-Chemistra kingdom?" asked Anastasia as Jomi pondered about it.

"Oh, I think I've been going over there a few times to check on their.. uh.. political progress? You know the whole 'Post-Cataclysm Reconstruction' I've done here? I mean, yeah, they've been doing reconstruction too, but I feel that they've been stagnating, at least when compared to us. I guess we should head there.." said Jomi, before Anastasia received a message from her phone. "Oh. Queen Shley has sent me a message, it looks to be inviting you to her palace." said Anastasia as the other two look at the message.

"Uh.. what's the occasion? I know it's Valentine's Day and all, but why me?" asked Jomi as Anastasia shrugged. "I.. don't know princess, you know the queen more than us. Since.. well, the whole past." said Anastasia as Sasha nodded and adds, "Yeah! That queen has always been quite eccentric, even during the first meeting of the whole kingdom. She.. would be the type to be friends with you, honestly.." Jomi chuckles and looks at Sasha with a slight playful glare then asks, "How so, Sasha?"

"A bit weird, eccentric and obsessed with science. Also a queen of a massive kingdom with quite a long history of war. Like you." said Sasha, as Anastasia chuckled while Jomi looked away. "Okay, if there's one thing I'm rebutting to, it's that I'm not as good as her in 'science' okay? Besides, it's all just magic anyway. I don't.. nevermind. She's just.. better at me in that regard, while being less stable in terms of.. uh, government stuff? If I can say that, without being biased." explained Jomi, as Sasha nodded. "Well, we can't be sure~! We're subjects anyway of you, why would we be less biased? Isn't that right, Anastasia?" said Sasha as Anastasia nodded and added, "Ahem, yes. The princess has helped us significantly, I would be lying if I wasn't biased."

"Alright, alright.. Uh.. enough talking about her. We should just head over." said Jomi as they arrived at a massive gate that is a portal to the Scians-Chemistra Kingdom. "I always wondered how this worked.. Huh, I.. don't remember how I connected these worlds.." said Jomi, as Anastasia and Sasha looked at her in a bit of suprise. "Wait.. I'm yapping too much, sorry. Uh, I just.. haven't read up on it after a while.. Hey, it's been like a year since I rebuilt the dark world from the first catacylsm.. I might be immortal, but I'm also very much a person with limited memory and.. uh... limited.. shit, I'm yapping again, sorry." said Jomi, before they entered the gate.

"Princess, it isn't necessarily bad to be a talkative person, it is just.. surprising sometimes to learn something new from you." reassured Anastasia as Sasha added, "Basically.. uh.. big suprise. I'm not.. uh.. opposed to learning something new, we just.. weren't expecting you to reveal that right there, as a throwaway line, or something.." Jomi nods and looks at the two, with a neutral expression. "It's fine, no need to reassure me. I just.. realized something I should've been paying attention to.. But, whatever. That's.. for future me to figure out. For now, let's just enter the queen's palace." said Jomi, as the two nodded, and they entered the palace.

The queen's party is quite.. full, music playing some form of electronica as the lights go around the huge ballroom. "Ah.. I can see how.. uh.. Shley has been using the tech I introduced.." said Jomi as she and her companions walked until Shley directly came up to them, holding some red wine. "Welcome..! Welcome, dear guests of Dajovy and the Castle..!" said Shley, almost drunk as she held on to Jomi's shoulder. "Haha.. ummm.. yeah, hi!" greeted Jomi, as Shley smirked and looked at Jomi more clearly.

"I've been taking your advice quite well..! Been making some.. potions. See this wine? Quite delicious no? Drink it, I dare you.." said Shley as she gave the red wine to Jomi while the other two watched. "Uh... you sure this won't poison me?" asked Jomi, as Shley chuckled and shook her head. "No, no.. Why would I do that? Besides, the wrath of these two will be super big, and then.. I won't be left alone, making potions in my bedroom, ehe~" answered Shley as she pointed to the other two. "Alright, I trust you.." said Jomi as she drank the super sweet wine, she was confused on it but it felt fine to drink it. "Okay? Uh.. why?" asked Jomi, as Shley took the wine glass and placed it on a nearby table as her eyes glowed red.

"Ooh! Ooh.. ah? WOW!! Ah~" mumbled Shley as her eyes glowed and stared into Jomi's eyes before her eyes stopped glowing. "Your.. wow. Okay, so.. that potion just.. gave me some.. ideas about your.. perspective on me, and surprisingly, it isn't that bad.. considering what I just did." said Shley, as the two glared at Shley while Jomi tilted her head in confusion. "Huh?! Wha.. Hey! What in the.. world you mean?!" questioned Jomi, as Shley blushed a bit. "Hmm.. the potion's just meant to see if the designated drinker is actually developing love to me, or are just platonic or even just using me for political motives.. Uh.. it's just that.. aside from the tech collab I saw.. There's a lot of.. certain images of me that I'd prefer to keep to myself.." said Shley as the two looked at Jomi in confusion.

"I.. okay.. A girl... needs her time alone sometimes.. and sometimes.. those times lead to.. those. I.. why the fuck did you go there?! I swear I have more.. flattering memories for you..!" said Jomi, as the other two got the implication and chuckled a bit. "I already knew of some things, so.. I kinda glossed over them.. Hey, I don't judge.. maybe a little bit, might I suggest using—" responded Shley as Jomi held her hand and shook her head intensely. "Please... do not tell this in a semi-private party..! I don't want to just.. **please**." said Jomi, as Shley thought about what to say.

"Alright, I'll stop.. As if I didn't have my own things to worry about, hey~ After this whole day, maybe I'll message you about it." said Shley as Jomi nodded. "Okay, whew.. Fine.. ahaha.." said Jomi, as she tried to calm herself down. "I know the princess has.. niche interests in her alone time, but.. not like this, honestly." commented Anastasia as Sasha agreed and nodded. "Sh— shut up.." said Jomi, as Shley smiled and looked around. "Welp, I still have to process what I just saw.. and continue this party, I'm guessing you're going home, Jomi?" asked Shley as Jomi nodded. "Ah.. well, I guess so.. I don't really have an affinity to parties either." answered Jomi, as Shley nodded and showed them the way out.

"Well, I'm going home.. Um, I'm curious though. Anastasia, and Sasha.. You two have been awfully close these past few months, any news?" asked Jomi, as they headed out of Scians-Chemistra and to Jomi's Castle. "Oh, I'm not quite sure what you mean, princess.. Yes, we've been close, that is because we manage the overground city and underground city together." said Anastasia as Sasha rolled her eyes and bumped Anastasia. "She wants to know if we're fucking." said Sasha as Anastasia blushed and looked away. "She's not ready to admit it, but our combined exercise is far more than just supporting each other and having better vitality." continued Sasha, as Jomi chuckled and nodded.

"I get it. I was always wondered why it was just you two always, even when adding people would be beneficial." said Jomi, as Anastasia added, "Well.. I do believe me and Sasha can take care of most jobs. It's not just because of our.. peculiar relationship." Sasha nodded and added, "Hell yeah, just trust us Jomi. We promise we'll keep the 'exercises' to a minimum." Anastasia held Sasha's hand tightly as Sasha gasped and smirked. "Princess, what about you?" asked Anastasia, as Jomi looked away in reflection. "Uh.. um.. nothing really.. as if I have.. a.. relationship to talk about?' said Jomi, as Sasha looked at Anastasia then smirked at Jomi. "So the Mijo obsession continues?" commented Sasha, as Jomi shook her head fervently.

"W—what?! What do you mean by that..? I.. we.. we're just really close partners. That doesn't mean anything! He has a girlfriend, you know." said Jomi, as Anastasia retorted, "That doesn't mean you don't have an interest in the guy. It's not exactly secret that you have a special relationship with him." Jomi then put her hands up and said, "I swear it's all platonic! I just.. um.. sometimes have the idea to.. okay, I.. like.. okay, it's.. not anything weird.. But, umm.. let's just say being a quite similar person in terms of everything but the world and form, really makes you wonder about that guy, okay?"

"Sure sure.. whatever helps you sleep at night, Jomi.." said Sasha as Anastasia smiled. "Eh.. I do admit, he has a certain look.. No wonder he has a girlfriend.. But, anyway.. Princess, you look very tired?" added Anastasia as Jomi nodded. "I.. yeah.. It's.. just.. been a while since I spoke this much, Mijo and his lightner buddies have been quite busy.. So, yeah.. cooped up in the bedroom.." said Jomi, as the other two nodded. "As your subordinates, we ask of you to go and rest for tonight, capiche?" asked Anastasia as Jomi nodded again. "Okay, okay.. I'll be heading to my bedroom then, bye.!" said Jomi, before they separated and Jomi went inside her room. She quickly switched to her pajamas and fell asleep quickly, the day took her energy so she slept easily.

_To the Light, a certain classroom, a reflection on life and love..._

"Hmm.. I've always wondered.. why in the hell aren't there good men out 'ere?!" asked Lauvielle to herself as she looked at the current male population of her class section. "Like, let's seee here.. nope.. you're too racist... too Leviente-like.. nah, you already have someone.. hmm.. well, wait.. yeah, their personalities, they just aren't for me.." said Lauvielle as she sighs. "The few good men.. uh.. Mijo, he has a girlfriend.. hmm.. the other one doesn't want one.. Agh! The others.. JR.. Fexili.. nah. They're.. like.. they just don't.. dabble in love I guess." continued Lauvielle, as Ikari entered the classroom on her phone.

"Huh? What are you still doing here, Lauvielle? You know, Mijo is with Rhida this time of day, so he's not here." said Ikari, as Lauvielle nodded. "I know **that.** I even greeted them when they went out." said Lauvielle, as Ikari shrugged. "Aight. Whatevs. I'm just sayin. It's not everyday that **guy** actually goes on a date." said Ikari, as they both chuckled. "He has a girlfriend now.. He has to." explained Lauvielle as she looked at a wall nearby.

"And.. well, It's not that I am expecting him to be here, it's just.. almost always, he's here I guess.. Does that make sense? Like, usually.. at the end of the week, there's me.. him, and usually random people, could be those boys, could be you, could be my other friends.. But, one thing stays the same, he's usually there until the room's locked for the weekends." explained Lauvielle as Ikari raised her eyebrows. "Oh? So you've come to expect him.."  replied Ikari, as Lauvielle thought about it.

"Umm.. yeah. I guess. Maybe I just miss having a constant? Like.. just.. you know, I have a lot of connections and all.. But, um.. I don't know, I feel lost in finding what.. 'love' means. Get me? Like.. I got duped by one guy, and now.. I don't know, I've been cautious since." responded Lauvielle, as Ikari nodded and sat on a table nearby. "I get it, I guess... You know, the whole.. past? Where I was basically reset on my relationships, and then I met him?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle nodded. "You've told me before.. What about it?" asked Lauvielle as Ikari brushed her hair and tried to find the right words to say.

"I just... well, I am a bitch. So, I got attached to him a lot during that time, and.. to be honest, he's the type.. Mijo I mean, to be good if you're honest and straightforward about things, just.. he tends to.. not have a good handling of things if it's implied or hidden. I get it, I hate lying pieces of shit too.. But, you know.. He's also more.. serious? I guess he can be like.. insane, like us, but you know, the clearheaded one in like.. a group of insanity. Which is.. well, nice.. But of course, I grew tired of him, and.. I just.. didn't want to admit it? But yeah, I.. spoke to him about it, but framing it differently.. He basically said, 'Go ahead.' and.. well I did, got some friends from that girl scout org, and even reconnected with some old ones.. Yeah, but.. basically, what I wanted to say is.. he.. probably just... wants to be a constant in people's lives, in friendships no less. He relates to people and trusts them in months, which is why he doesn't have long lasting friendships that doesn't carry over, like.. Leviente yeah? They're acquaintances nowadays.. or even JR.." explained Ikari, as Lauvielle processed the words, looking serious.

"Hmm.. that's more of a Mijo talk than.. what I envisioned. I mean, yes, Mijo is a part of it.. But, it isn't that.. well.. I appreciate it, but we are both best friends with him, so we know how he does things.. I mean, if there was some sort of chemistry, maybe I'd have tried speaking to him about love and shit, but I.. just don't have the guts, especially to a guy friend like him.. You know? Like.. I feel that.. he doesn't feel.. crushes? You get me? Like.. I send him jokes about attractive fictional characters sometimes, and he's like; 'Okay, cool!' And it's not like he's hiding anything, but that disconnect from like.. the whole romance thing.. Honestly, I'm still surprised about his relationship with Rhida.. Guess they found something that binds them together.." responded Lauvielle as Ikari nodded in agreement.

"I guess.. Girl, like.. wait, remember the whole student's night.. First one at least. And.. well, I don't know, that relationship has always been tumultuous, with both sides having issues in connection and attraction.. Hearsay of course, from Mijo and whispers from others.. Like, they're literally perfect for each other because they both understand each other's issues and can work through it." said Ikari, as Lauvielle tilted her head from left to right. "Eh.. If you can call it that. Rhida has always been more forward, he really isn't the type to be.. forward? Or maybe he has been, I don't know, I don't know their relationship enough. I agree though, been with him since the whole start of his relationship and the dark world magical shenanigans, can confirm a lot." added Lauvielle, as Ikari nodded.

"Ahaha.. Well well, guess it all goes back to Mijo huh? Let's move on from him, how about your relationships? The whole point about Mijo is that you have a somewhat platonic best friend that's somewhat always there, but you desire something closer, so what has happened in that department?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle made a sad face. "Eh.. aside from a few crushes here and there, bla bla.. Confessions lead nowhere.. alleged cheating.. connections with.. umm.. less than savory people.. Yeah, no luck there. Even today, the so-called 'love day'; Valentine's Day.. I missed out on someone, that I'm not even sure about.. Just trust me and let me say it's another 'ooh this guy's cool I guess, oh, he has this or that flaw, well.. I can go beyond that! Oh no, oh no.. what's this new info I just got?! Try anyway, fail massively.. Ah, well better luck next time!' type of.. cringe behavior I partake in." said Lauvielle as Ikari chuckled..

"Become a lesbian, Lauvielle. Join me~!" said Ikari, as Lauvielle chuckled as well. "Nah. I've figured out my.. interests a long time ago, but ugh.. As if the world's making me go through a drama every time..." said Lauvielle as Ikari responded, "I've always wondered, what's so.. appealing about the whole love thing to you? I mean, okay.. yeah we all.. mostly have crushes, then we go and try the interaction, and figure it out from there, what I'm wondering is.. what's with the.. obssession, basically?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle sighed and scratched her head. "Ah.. an obsession.. it's.. well, don't all people wish for love? I mean, I think that's the norm yeah? But I do admit, I may be a bit more of a hopeless romantic... Maybe just maybe.. I just.. have some things to process.." Lauvielle sighs again, as she touched her head. "Eh.. now I see the whole.. uh.. pointlessness of this whole.. like.. review on the 'good' men.. or even just the social dynamics of the teachers.. or maybe I'm just getting tired.." continued Lauvielle as Ikari nodded, and stood up.

"You need to go home girl, it's been a while, and I.. kinda needed too go earlier, but didn't wanna leave you hanging.." said Ikari, as she grabbed her bags and her phone. "You're right.. Besides, I think—" said Lauvielle before her mother was calling her phone. "Hays, right on time mom.. anyway, that means I need to go to the service before she chews me out again, welp.. see you next, Kai! (Ikari)" continued Lauvielle before she answered the phone and rushed to get her bag. Then, Ikari left as Lauvielle rushed out as a school faculty member arrived to lock the rooms for the weekends.

## Author's Note:

Oh that's done. WOWWWWWWW in 3 days, I actually completed a massive spinoff? With good plot? NO WAY!!!! By the way, I haven't mentioned it but this is a canon chapter, it just fits better as a spinoff, since I learned that tying events (i.e. Christmas) with main events in the season causes problems with the massive plot I am outlining.. (Especially since I haven't figured out what to do with Cara/Rasca that makes them threatening while not being too powerful, basically, enough to keep the tension but not enough where it doesn't make sense that the characters give up in fighting or lose)

This one is as obvious as the darn title, a Valentine's Day special! This time, since the event ended in a Friday, I got to write it during the weekends! (Might have done it yesterday if it wasn't for this fucking reoccuring headache from the aftereffects of my 2-week long hiatus from any actual work due to intense sickness) Yeah, it isn't that I wasn't working on anything (Rewrite of C1-3S1 is underway! Yes, I'm doing that) but I literally couldn't work on it due to my intense pain.

But I managed to push through this one, so I hope that you enjoyed that short break and some character development as well.. Oh, and the whole world building of the dark world! (I said this is canon, so this is based on my NEW outline, which as you can see, has some effects on the world) and other other confirmations (affirmation of some relationships and the promised Mizo/Rika integration) Anyway, this note was quite a long one, because of the huge hiatus, maybe for longer works (i.e. c1-3s1 rewrite) I should officially make a 'director's/writer's commentary' since the reason for these two author's note from beginning to end is to in fact, document the beginning AND end of writing a story..

But.. no promises! Did I say I still have a headache? Anyway, that's the goal for the remaining days of february (maybe into march?).. Finish rewrite of C1-3S1, then the start of the post Dajovy arc rewrite.. finish S1, then S2! Yep, quite ambitious I know, but that's just life I guess. Anyway, it's not that hard bound, I just wanna set up some goals for myself, aside from the boring schoolworks, so finally... **THAT'S ABOUT IT! SEE YA~**

## Author's Note:

Collection of drafts, blabla during the formation of this idea of: 'the dark world just being the city of Cabanatuan' even though that doesn't make sense / hasn't made narrative sense to put in. Plus, I wanna test if people would fit the magical world mixed with the familiar city.

Oh and some unexplored drafts of other lightners I haven't had the time to properly integrate into the story, such as the Ashley storyline

_September 10..._

A classroom with double doors on opposite corners on the 4th floor of a school building in Honrato C. Pez Sr. Memorial Science High School overlooks the City of Cab. Right now, the classroom is empty as it's currently 6:00 and either people haven't even awoken yet or are still on the way. The view up there is amazing, sprawling buildings, the roofs of various structures, and the early dawn bringing sun to the cold damp area right after another massive rain.

Among its students is a boy named Sean Leisha Vilanva. As an early riser and just having another quick journey, he hoped to open the classroom, open his phone then go visit his girlfriend, or whatever after a while, but then as he closes his eyes for a minute...

_Suddenly a dark fountain appeared._

Then, unnoticed, someone closed the two doors quickly and rushed off.

"Woah—"

"What the—"

He couldn't believe his eyes, he only had seen these in videos or random shorts (short videos). "Am I hallucinating.. or.." Then he felt himself fall for just a second, coincidentally closing his eyes as he opened it again and saw.. well, it was the same classroom. But, he felt a bit weirder now, maybe more **magical** even. But he sighed and shrugged it as some ghosts or dream he'd causally mention later.

Then, as he went to pick up his phone, he realized..

"Ah?! What the fuck??!!" 

She's a woman??

"Now hold on," he thinks. "Maybe a dream in a dream?" But wait then he'd wake up.. Also she just noticed her clothes looking very different. Instead of the white shirt and black pants that the school usually is chill with now it's bright red blouse with puffed up arm sleeves and a dark red gown with burgundy colored pants beneath it.

When she tried getting her phone, she could only summon a bow of a bow and arrow. "Huh?" Then before she could question the magic system, another girl appeared. At first she was surprised, before turning serious and saying, "Hello, I'm.. Mi..ha. Yes, Miha." introduced Miha as she then looked around her before looking at Sean. "What's your name?"

"I'm.. uh.. Leisha, sure." Sean stands up. "How do you get out of here?" asked Sean as Miha nodded and answered, "Sealing the fountain. I thought it'd be here, but.." 

_"A fountain, huh.." Sean thinks._

".. it's not, so.. We should get moving. There might be enemies spawning, and if you want to get out of here as soon as possible..." said Miha, as she felt an abyssal presence and summoned her sword's sheath. "She's a samurai, but.. also dressed weirdly." Sean thinks as she visualizes Miha as wearing a blue undershirt, red coat and maroon pants, and long white hair tied with a purple tie.

"Hey?" Miha gets Sean's attention. "Let's go, I've checked here, it just seems to be abyss monsters preparing to spawn." Sean walks up to her, she noticed that she was also wearing heels, great.. for fighting, huh? Anyway, Miha continued, "Just follow me, unless you know how to use that thing." Miha points out her bow, without string even (how did she not notice that??). "Sure sure.." then before they could continue, an abyss monster spawned to the left, seems to be a humanoid figure with a sword.

Before Sean could fully react, one slash and the monster's gone, as Sean sees Miha's blade unsheathed, sparking with purple electro, and a glint of vermillion pyro wrapped around like a vine on the what seems to be steel (if that is not a steel lookalike that's insanely durable). "Ah?! Miha..?" blurted out Sean as Miha sheathed her sword like an expert. "Weak.." Miha looks around. "We should go, before more appear."

And so, the two went down the stairs, careful to not slip in these somewhat makeshift and basic steel stairs. As they went down, Sean noticed how Miha was waiting for her clumsy self as she tried to adjust to these heels in these narrow steps. Miha didn't say anything about it, as she looked focused on looking out for monsters. "So, Miha.." Sean tried to make conversation, in this empty school. "..What's your story, um, Miha?" asked Sean as both are still a bit tense from the monster that appeared.

"Long story." said Miha, as she looked out of the 2nd floor stairs. "All you need to know, is that if you want to find a way out, I have a way, and.." Miha looks at Sean, really looks at her before continuing, "...Leisha, we're kinda the same. In that, we're both not from this world, am I wrong?" Sean clenched her teeth before nodding, "..you're right, but how do you know?"

"I know a lightner when I see one." said Miha before continuing down the stairs. "What does that mean..?" questioned Sean before Miha answered with a hint of annoyance, "Light magic is.. easy to detect within people, especially since the opposing... abyss magic is inherently impure and also way more common." Miha looks at Sean's hidden eyes through her bangs. "You're inexperienced, and haven't even used magic instinctively once. That's a telltale sign if you also look old enough that you speak coherently."

"Um.. is English like automatic here? Kasi, kung totoo ang sinasabi mo, you must know—" Miha cuts off Sean's question. "Ugh, yes. Alam ko ang Filipino, English and Spanish. Depende sa world, it could be named differently, but should resemble the light world language closely. I'm also a lightner, but I.. got here before you did." Miha stops the two at the bottom of the stairs, just as Sean was about to ask something. 

"How _did_ you get here?" asked Miha, as Sean shrugged. "Some random dark smoke appeared in my classroom, and I got here." Sean looked at Miha. "How about you?" asked Sean, before Miha suddenly started moving, forcing Sean to follow. "About the same." Miha was going to say something to follow that, but she shut herself up as the two moved down the path then to the stairs of the 2-floor building that seemed old.

"I have a feeling, it's somewhere here." said Miha as she unsheathed her sword when an abyss monster appeared behind them, and was already striking. Sean narrowly avoided danger but she tripped onto the steps. "An increased presence means we're getting nearer. Come, with me! Now!" stated Miha as she dragged Sean up while the monsters tried to stop them but Miha, one-handed cuts through.

Somehow, in the heat of danger, Sean felt an arrow quiver on her back as she draw a.. whatever arrow type it was it seemed to at least incapacitate the monsters so Miha could cut them. "Miha! San tayo papunta??" shouted Sean as they finally got to the 2nd floor only to realize that there were abyss crossbow users on the building they just left and to the left, there was even more. "Move!!" Before Sean could process that, Miha dragged her out just before the arrows hit the cement floor.

"Open the door when we get to the room I think the dark fountain is, do it forcefully. It's probably going to be locked." Miha told Sean, just as Miha deflected more arrows, now at their front. "I'll tell you.." Miha dragged it out as she slashed through abyss monsters and deflected many, many arrows headed towards them. "..now!" Miha pushed Sean to the door as she deflected and slashed through enemies slowly closing in on them.

"Hah.. okay.." Sean desperately tried to open the door, it was locked, but even she could feel something dizzying past the door. "Come on.." Sean was getting desperate as her periphery saw Miha somehow battling three hordes of abyss monsters at the same time, her sword stance and iajitsu mastery expert, as she felt her focus wane due to the exhaustion. "Damn it!!" Sean gave up on the doorknob and just tried to forcefully push it, ramming herself onto the door, more and more hard and desperately.

Then, it finally burst open as she fell onto the floor face-first. She heard Miha scream then the door closed as the monsters tried to open it but she heard Miha holding it down. "Get up!" shouted Mijo, "GET THE FUCK UP!!!" Sean immediately tried and clumsily got up, as she came to her senses. "H—huh?" Sean looked around and widened her eyes at the big fountain inside the room, the chairs spread out because of the Intramurals, though, this is likely just replicating the light world room.

"W—WHAT DO I DO?? T—THAT'S SOO BIG!!" questioned Sean as Miha grumbled and summoned a lance that had molten rock floating before she stuck it on the door as the molten rock stuck to the sword as it held back the horde outside. "I—It's a weird thing to describe, but.." Miha blurted out, as she gasped as she felt the door strain from the pressure. "..you need to grab your heart and float it inside the fountain." Miha stops to refocus on trying to hold back the door before finishing with, "Remember, we're lightners? Yeah, that heart can apparently light up that. So, go do that before we all die." Miha focused at the door as Sean took a moment to process that.

"Take my heart.." mumbled Sean as she looked down at her chest and used her hands to grab straight there, and somehow, instead of just punching herself she managed to actually grab her heart?? Which, thank god, she thought, is just some stylized depiction of a three dimensional floating heart, and not a human heart. "Um.. okay?? Then float it..?" Sean tentatively floated the heart into the fountain and as it settled there, it suddenly lightened up everything.

"IT'S WORKING??!!" Sean excitedly shouted, as Miha responded, "Hmph. Good job. Leisha.." Miha stopped for a moment before she continued, "If.. you encounter me again, make sure to say 'La-Liu-Lei-Lo' in that way, I.." Miha stopped for a second again, before blurting out, "..meet a lot of people." Before Sean could thank her, the light lightened up the room too much as she felt her body float.

_Sean.. wakes up?_

"Ugh.." Sean looked around him, and he saw that it was getting hotter and more bright, meaning the sun was a bit more high in the sky and he just accidentally napped for.. 

_Sean checks his phone._

"6:30 AM..?" Sean, confused, looks around, coincidentally his friend arrived with his messenger bag. "Yo, dude.. you look like you just woke up." The friend put his things down. "Yeah.. napped haha.." Sean stood up, still feeling a bit hazy. "Heh, too much zombie crushers?" teased the friend as both chuckled before Sean checked his phone again. "Right, intramurals.." The two then head out of the classroom to the world, for the day to start.

_Much later, 17:00, Sean, right after a volleyball game, feeling bummed out as he and this.. classmate of his, Mijo were cleaning up and just as the other guy left..._

"Hey uh.. Mijo?" Sean called out to Mijo, as he turned around and responded, "Hm? What?" asked Mijo, as Sean, while focusing on the games and the hype of the intramurals, couldn't shake off that.. girl, Miha. And whatever the fuck happened that morning. He felt that Mijo, for some reason, had some knowledge, and even if he didn't, well, he thinks Mijo won't pay much attention to it.

"So," Sean smiled. "La-Liu-Lei-Lo?" Sean said in a sort of joking way, where he can take it back and not make it serious, but then Mijo's reaction was, "Wha—ah.. huh.." Mijo stopped dead in his tracks, "Leisha." said Mijo, as Sean lightened up. "Yeah! Wait— So.." Sean gasped in  piecing the logic together. "Ugh, so.." Mijo looked around. "You might have just been accidentally or.. probably intentionally, not sure, dragged into my world. The dark world of magic~!" explained Mijo in a sort of eccentric fantastical narrative way, also sarcastic.

"Um.. huh. So.. how.. y—yeah I'm lost." Sean admitted as Mijo groaned. "Just, I'll invite you to the GC, my website there has most of the history, magic system and worlds that you have questions about. It.. all mostly applies, as I update it.. relatively frequently.." Sean interrupted, "Haha, ano ibig sabihin na yon?" Mijo tilted his head side-to-side. "Just trust me, there's weeks where nothing happens, and days where history happens." Mijo got his bags. "So.. any other questions?"

"Is turning into a girl, usual or..?" asked Sean as Mijo amusingly shook her head. "Well, unless your power's based on your appearance, no, not usually. I.. have just.. gotten someone to do something for me." Mijo shook his head. "And.. I gotta specify," Mijo narrows his eyes in thought before continuing, "..call me whatever. It just has to be something I called myself once." Mijo turns to leave. "Sure bro!" Sean turned to the classroom parts behind him. "Bahala na 'ko dito, buh-bye!" Mijo waves his left hand goodbye.

_The next day.. @ 7:15_

_At that same building, but the 2nd floor, instead.._

"Ugh.." 

Ashley Luia Trena, who is she? Well, let's let her explain herself, then.

"Bla bla.. shooting at that country again... trans issues.. atheism... ugh." Ashley looks at her tablet, with an almost intense disgust from it all. "Um, ash, maybe you should take a break from it all, I mean it is kinda.. intramurals." reminded Claiara, a friend of her. "Oh yeah, the chess game... eh, got that in the bag." replied Ashley as she got up. "Let's explore the school instead! I haven't been up to the 4th floor in a while."

Ashley goes straight to the 4th floor, climbing up the stairs to the right, which were less dangerous and actually had cement, but as she reached the high floor and wandered, she wondered if the bathrooms were working here, this high up. And so, she walked to the first green door that's close and opened it. Well, it seems to be a regular bathroom, but.. already, you can tell it was lightly used because of the uncleaned smell. Anyway, she closed it immediately and turned left.

"Ooh, the door here. I wonder if.." Ashley steps closer and tries to open it, but the door wasn't budging, locked. "Hey!" Ashley, against her logic deciding it would be funny, rammed herself into the door, as she went inside it, but uh.. everything's dark there. Too dark, she thinks and before she could turn around, the door closed on her and the ground, which apparently existed, stopped existing as she fell to the endless abyss below.

_A new lightner had entered the dark world!_

_Splat!_

She fell face first onto the tile flooring. "Ugh.. what the.." Ashley got up, but somehow wasn't injured. Instead she was at this weird stall, that seemed to be two stalls but the divider to her right was broken and to the left of her, some portal of some kind. "Man.. this is.." She looks at herself, and immediately recognized the designs. "Huh, wait, interesting.." Ashley set out to find a mirror, and so went to the portal and when she came out, a whole new world was fully around her.

She was in some sort of castle garden, and she saw that massive main castle building, with towering spikes and a glass window on the middle, a bit lower, where the owner of this castle presumably is. Anyways, this was all in some mix of wintery landscape, to the far off cliffs and snow. As she inspected the area, someone met her. "Um.. hey?" greeted someone, as Ashley turned around and instinctively summoned her all-new blue staff with a moon on the top. "Hey— wait!" The girl who Ashley just pointed her staff to, was a bit shocked but was holding some sword sheath. "Um.. huh.." Ashley was speechless, she just processed that the girl in front of her looked like a princess with her golden tiara on her long hair, the flowy purple battle dress, and.. damn, she's fucked.

"I mean no harm.. Um, but you.. seem to be a lightner?" asked the girl, as Ashley tilted her head. "Huh? Like in Deltarune??" asked Ashley back to the girl before she nodded. "Y—yeah, I'm Princess Jomi, of the Dark, and the Kingdom of Kultima." Jomi unsummoned her sword and turned her back. "Come, I'll show you around the castle." said Jomi, as Ashley also put down her staff and followed Jomi.

_Montage, I think._

Jomi showed Ashley the rest of the gardens,

"That's the Dark Pearl Statue, of.. uh.. our symbol, a pirate ship with a pearl acting like a sun shining down."

"Cool, who's here..." Ashley took a double-look. "Hey, I know some of these people, Mijo.. Ikari, Lauvielle, and Rhida.." Ashley looked at Jomi, with irritation and excitement. "Not a single one bothered to go at me, and ask.. 'Hey, Trena.. wanna see our MAGICAL ARENA??' like.. ugh." Ashley felt her elemental power already form, dark hydro, but with a hint of moons around her.

Then the inside, to Jomi's office,

"Woah, is this your office?"

"Yeah, it's where I work and—"

"Oh finally!! A mirror!"

Ashley rushed to the mirror beside Jomi's table. "Alright.. Mirror mirror on the wall.." muttered Ashley as she saw herself, as Jomi approached from behind. The woman in front of Ashley was, striking, like she is a mix of the two of her most favorite videogame characters. She had this flowing white hair with magenta highlights all the way down to her knees, several white feather-like ribbons floating on the back of her head, and heterochromatic eyes, with droplets for each. Her right eye is light blue with a dark blue pupil, while her left eye reverses the color scheme with a purple outer ring.

She is also wearing a dark blue suit-like outfit over a dark red vest with a jabot, her cuffs are folded back and both have deep blue frills. Then, a small dark blue top hat tipped to the left of her head, with metal flourishes mimicking a crown. At the bottom, dark blue shorts covered with a flowing white semi-transparent skirt all held up by a golden plated dark blue belt.

"Wow wow.. This is.. amazing!!" Ashley almost expected her eyes to sparkle like those in the anime she watches but.. she just sees her normal excited face. "Uh.. Miss, you uh... didn't tell me your name!" said Jomi, as Ashley froze up and laughed awkwardly. "Ahhh, right.." responded Ashley before turning around to face Jomi. "I'm... Furibina, of.." Ashley looks around her. "uh.. Honrato, God of Justice, Regina of All Waters, Kindreds, Peoples and Laws and the Moon Maiden." Jomi doesn't believe all the titles Ashley espoused but Jomi nodded. "Furibina is it? Well, nice to meet you!" She shook hands with Ashley.

Ashley looks around, sees a sofa, rushes and sits on it before asking, "So.. dear princess, where shall I find um.. evil to be vanquished?" asked Ashley to Jomi, as she also sits down. "If you say it like that.. haha.. um, I—I suggest the training area first.. which I shall guide you there if you want, or um.. Nuevo Leon! We.. uh.. could always use more force there.." Ashley stood up in excitement. "Hah, I don't need the tutorial! I got this! Bathed in fire, as they say."

_Later, Nuevo Leon.. @ 10:00_

"God fucking dammit!!" Ashley fights through abyss hordes, alone. Ashley uses big bubble attacks from her staff to stun and trap the abyss monsters then her new blue scepter she accidentally summoned swirling with water as she smashed whoever came close. "You know, Ashley, it is fun being powerful.." Ashley bashed a random abyss monster about to bonk her with a club. "... when you've mastered it!!!" 

"Go go go my beloved minions!" Ashley summons cute water blobs to help her defend against the monsters on her back. "Oh gosh, HEY!" Ashley saw her blobs her getting overwhelmed and so had to help them smash the abyss monsters away. "Let my name echo in song!" Ashley then turned and did her ultimate, a massive burst of water around her like a stage as a wave of high waters came down upon the monsters who thought going near her was a good idea. "Ta-da~!" Ashley smiled.

_She.. continued fighting more until she left because she felt her elemental magic overclocking..._

_Jomi's office, @ 13:45.._

"Worth it.." Ashley mumbled next to Jomi, who was looking at her, concerned. "Miss Furibina, even Mijo didn't go for that long, are you sure you're fine?" questioned Jomi, as Ashley nodded weakly. "Mmf—fine.." Ashley moved around to lay down on her back. "A bit of rest.. and.. i thinnk... i should.. be fine.. right..?" asked Ashley, as Jomi sighed and answered, "Y—yes, if only because of overclocking your magic. But, still you should.. take care of yourself, and NOT fight abyss monsters for an hour.."

Ashley is already sleeping. "Miss!" Jomi sighs and just carries her, through multiple rooms, until she lays her on her bed in her bedroom. "Um.. hope um.. you know your.. um.. just stay here, okay?" said Jomi, then started to leave before stopping and saying, "Oh! Right, uh... you.. did well by the way.. managed to push the conservation area a few miles ahead." then leaving fully.

_Honrato, SHS Building, 4th floor.. @ 16:00_

"Whew.. that was.." Ashley walks out of the dark world portal. "..THE BEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE!" Ashley immediately looked around her, nobody saw her scream, good. "That Jomi, she's super generous for a supposed ruler of a kingdom. Maybe it's like deltarune?? But, she has subjects, and servants so.." Ashley speculated as she continued to walk then looked around as she saw Mijo, chilling at the nearby balcony, looking out.

"Mijo.." Ashley took a huge breath before walking up with the most serious face she should put on. "Hey, Mijo! Remember me? I was a classmate of yours, last school year." greeted Ashley as Mijo looked at her, eyed her bookbag then her sweater before answering, "Yeah. What's up?" asked Mijo, as Ashley narrowly looked at him then said, "So, hiding stuff hm? Dark worlds, elemental magic, and Jomi, is it?" Mijo maintained a straight face, but you could tell his breath was quickened. "Hm? Really now?"

"YES!! I SAW YOUR—" Ashley gripped the iron railings to make herself quieter. "..I saw your statue, like.. the Dark Pearl thing, it's all the way back like.. two years ago!" Mijo nodded. "Aight. What do you want to do about it?" asked Mijo, as Ashley tilted her head slightly to the right in slight amazement. "I—Duh! Invite my friends or something, I asked Jomi, apparently this 'protection of the dark' just magically makes sure you're good if there were anything in the light world you meant to do! Like, that's literally so convenient, you can skip exams, PTs, and any dumb stuff!"

"She probably mentioned that the equivalent will also appear in the dark world, yes? Skip the exam, but you'll fight a massive boss." said Mijo as Ashley nodded excitedly. "Best part! I get to be the characters of games!! It's just.. everything's been boring, and.. blatantly dystopian lately, y'know?" said Ashley as she looked away. "It's nice to have a world to go to, and have it feel **real.**" Mijo nodded, and looked out. "Mhm. Agreed." 

_Next day, Friday @ 08:00._

"Impromptu matchup, really?! And like.. oh—" Ashley was complaining to Claiara as they were walking in the dark world, from the portal. "Wait, really?! W—what's mine?" asked Claiara, as Ashley shrugged. "Dunno, but I WANT to challenge Mijo, heard he's a like.. lightbringer or something and super important, I wanna know if I could beat him." Claiara nodded, but cautiously replied, "Ash, battling Mijo? In a battle with his like.. you say, two years experience.. you'd be able to defeat him?"

"Heh." said Ashley, before they stopped at what seemed to be the venue, a big gate and behind it, rows of buildings from the left and right, but in the center was this massive coliseum. "I thought they had no budget, yet what's this..?" asked Ashley as she stepped forward with Claiara to the silver guard. "State who you are. Only lightners, for now, can compete." The silver guard said, as she looks at them with a neutral expression. "I'm Furibina de Honrato, and this is my royal companion, Clara of Lovelace, Honrato, of course!"

The silver guard looks at her list, then at Ashley before nodding, "Alright, welcome.." She pauses for a minute before sighing, "Your highnesses, enjoy your stay at the Lightner Intramurals 2025." Ashley and Claiara went in, as they saw a lot of people, now she was absurdly late, and this was kinda rushed as well, as she saw staff rushing with Jomi, then Mijo. Ashley proudly comments, "Hah, thought they'll be all organized, but the event hasn't even started yet.." Claiara pointed out, "You uh.. were late you know? If you're late so are they!"

"Right right," Ashley rolled her eyes. "Let's speak to my competitors, here.. While they fix the mess." Claiara nodded. "Where are our friends anyway..? Like, Solphia or.. Jamiah?" asked Claiara, as Ashley sighed and looked around, not finding them within the modestly filled venue. She could see like.. a bunch of familiar faces, that Rhida girl that Mijo used to date, well.. she thinks anyway, talking to Lauvielle. Then Ikari, to like Dominio, a guy she knew vaguely before..

"Ughh.. this is going to take a while.." Ashley summons her staff. "So tempting.. grrr.." Claiara stood by her, adjusting her black suit with a red tie, the undershirt showing to be deeper red. She also wears black eye shadow and white hair is tied up in a long ponytail with asymmetrical bangs. "Hey, uh.. why are you silent..??" asked Ashley as Claiara smiled. "I'm simply admiring my new form, Ash.. Didn't you?" Ashley scoffed, but was still smiling. "Whatever.."

_Hours later, @ 13:00._

_A simple rule: Which one runs out of the imaginary health bar on top of them, loses._

"And now.. the first match of the intramurals.." announced Jomi, as she looks over the arena with her silver guards, but also Mijo and Anastasia. "Furibina, a dark hydro sword user, with a royal moon aura versus..." Jomi shows Sean, who uh.. was in her girl form in the dark world. "..Leisha, a light pyro bow user, fiery and passionate, they come and fight!"

"Hah." Ashley scoffs. "You might be some leader, in the light world, Leisha.. But here?" Ashley summons her staff and sceptre. "I'm the queen." Sean, smirking quite a bit summoned her bow. "Haha.. it's uh.. it's a friendly tournament, y'know. But, sure! I'll try my best, might be a little ahem.. sick.. but.." Sean grabs an arrow. "..your path will not be smooth~"

"Let the games begin!" announced Jomi, as the two fight.

Ashley rushes in, her sceptre moving in as Sean dodges and gets an arrow in. "Tch." Ashley summons her three cute water blobs to attack Sean as she launches bubbles at her. Sean responds by launching fire arrows to pop the bubbles while reluctantly stabbing the blobs until they popped and returned to Ashley. "You—" 

Ashley summons waves of water, as she begins floating. Sean tries to dodge but one wave hits her as she's knocked down. Ashley immediately takes advantage and uses her ultimate, "Let the world, come alive, hehe~!" The stage is set as she makes waves come down on Sean before, "Triggered Explosions..!!" Sean fired a massive hail of arrows directly from her bow as she then falls, as Ashley is also shot and brought down to the floor. As Jomi looks at their arena health bars, both of them are empty.

"A... draw?" Jomi says as Ashley stands up, "Agh!?? Really?? Ugh... do we get a point..?" asked Ashley to Jomi, as she analyzes the tournament bracket and scoreboard. "Uh.. um.. we'll see. For now, the.. battle is inconclusive!" Ashley groans before prompty laying down on the floor as silver guards come and carry them out. "Huh, didn't think.. I'd not lose.." Sean muttered as well, before they were fully carried out.

"Interesting." said Mijo, as Jomi looks at him. "Hey, you're participating too, right?" asked Jomi as Mijo nodded. "Yes. But, as the last person against the winner. I have no need to prove my strength." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Alright, alright serious face." Jomi looks back at the arena. "What? Do you want me to say that I'm simply OP with god-like powers, because I wield a katana that can cut through time and space.. a mirage lance with the pyro power to burn through eternal winters.. and an—" Jomi shuts him up with, "Okay okay I get it! Jeez, I was just asking.." Both were still smiling.

"You two are really really weird with each other." Anastasia noted, as both nodded but refused to say more on the matter.

_End of the Three Drafts!_

## Author's Note:

Yo, what's up! So, it's definitely been a while since I published anything, especially a spinoff, but here! It's a slight deviation from canon, but I also wanted to
integrate something cool for this instead of repeating what I was doing in main Season 3 chapters. Anyway, this is a 3-day part draft, and I desperately wanted to 
write more of this and integrate it for a post-Arlen, pre-Manecony in-betweenm, where the situation wasn't dire but it wasn't arming up to be another battle with
Manecony. Anyway, aside from the new characters, I think I did well in making this a somewhat canon-divergent yet still possible event without restricting me much.

What I mean is, the current arc is leading up to an Arlen Fight, and an incursion into Manecony, and the reclamation of Nuevo Leon. But I wanted to unfocus from the
visible goals and instead focus on the less serious stuff, more fun designing as well as some leeway to honor the time I spent between September 10-12 writing. So,
I hope you enjoyed this, and if you want, totally expand this to a whole training and event arc, but as the single sole writer, I do not have the time, so.. anyways, see
you in the next one, good day and may you go in peace, goodbye~!

"Alright, let's see what'cha got for me, Jomi." said Mijo to himself before jumping in the dark world, his clothes switching to its dark world form. It is, a blue undershirt with a red coat held up by a belt, as well as red pants and red rubber shoes. He also has white hair, and his eyes flash yellow on the left and purple on the right when using elemental magic, but usually black.

"Surprise!" Jomi greeted Mijo, as he appeared. "Ah." Mijo blurted as he was genuinely surprised by Jomi being directly there that he had to look at her for a few seconds before immediately adding, "Ah, hello, Jomi.." Mijo then walked up to her and brushed her hair as she blushed, "H—hey?? Mijo! I—I know it's your birthday, but you can't just—" Mijo pulls back. "Sorry, sorry.. You just look so cute." remarked Mijo, as Jomi grumbled but turned away as they walked to the castle.

"Whatever, anyway." Jomi looks around in front of her. "September 7's your birthday, right?" asked Jomi, as she then turned to face him, directly looking at his eyes. "Duh, what are you saying..?" asked Mijo, with his right eyebrow raised. "What's.. mine?" asked Jomi, as Mijo was struggling to answer. "No, seriously, Mijo. Do you know?" further questioned Jomi, as Mijo shook his head. "No, actually.. I don't think you have mentioned it." responded Mijo, as Jomi sighed and mentally prepared herself.

"I've asked Cara about this, and she said something, and since you have a direct influence on me..." Jomi put her hands on his shoulders to emphasize her serious face. "What did you put it as..? Come on, we're both knowledgeable of my creation.." asked Jomi, as  her tone was both serious and a bit irritated. Mijo looked side-to-side then at Jomi, as he immediately put up a smug smile. "You know, I could kiss you." said Mijo, as Jomi even got more irritated and held Mijo tighter. "Answer the _damn_ question, Mijo.." responded Jomi, way less serious but more irritated.

_"Okay, fine.. It's September 11."_

Jomi pulled back, sighing before turning her back. "Now, wasn't that easy..?" commented Jomi before walking ahead as Mijo shrugged and followed. "What? It's a good date, I picked it because it's Salvador Allende's unfortunate demise as a remembrance—" explained Mijo, as Jomi looked at him, half-irritated and half-playful, her eyes narrowed. "Yeah right, and what happened on that day too, besides that?" asked Jomi, as Mijo smiled and kissed Jomi before whispering in her ear, in a sing-songy voice. "The twin towers are falling~" 

Jomi pushed him away, a bit breathless and blushing before turning away again. "...Fine." Jomi starts walking. "Let's just go in before you start making out with me.." said Jomi in a lower, quieter voice as Mijo laughed.

_In Jomi's office, Jomi's Castle._

"Alright, so." Jomi sits down on the sofa as Mijo also does, in front of her. "Hey, y'know, I already had a good celebration, I have an actual light world guitar," Mijo shows it off with a summon of a black guitar. Mijo strums it to test its tune before making it disappear. "I went to an arcade, had fun shooting bad guys, drumming.. Then, we ate at a.. 'samgyup' restaurant. Basically, an all-you-can-eat buffet, where you cook your own meat. Then, ice cream and yogurt.. yeah. So, I'm already satisfied, and.." Mijo looks at Jomi. "You don't need to do anything, trust. Besides, you got your own birthday anyway in 3-4.. days, and I bet the kingdom's excited, since you're their eternal princess." yapped Mijo, as he laid back as he focused at Jomi looking out the big glass window overlooking Kultima and Dajovy City.

"I don't need a grand celebration.." said Jomi, as she looked at Mijo. "I mean, you get it, right?" asked Jomi to Mijo, as he nodded. "It's just when I was created. Nothing more, no less." continued Jomi, as she looked at him. "You may have a reason to look forward to yours, but.." Jomi sighs, ".. I've never truly wanted more than just.." Jomi holds a pillow. "..a simple gift, or just.. a rest day, alone.." Jomi looks at Mijo, "You.. get it, right..?" Jomi's voice cracks here, as Mijo looks down.

"..."

*"Yeah."*

Mijo sighs. "Look, it's not.. it's obvious, right?" asked Mijo, as Jomi tilted her head. "..guess I'm good at lying, hah." Mijo smiled darkly before his face turned serious, and there, you see his eyebags, which are usually invisible and lidded eyes, either a sign of boredom... or.. intense sadness someone's trying to hold back. "Falling in and out of grace, yet I'm still here.. every time." said Mijo, as he smiled darkly again. "If there's one thing I wished I did," said Mijo, as he looked at Jomi. "..it's to leave you alone." 

Jomi looks up at Mijo, whom is not exactly looking at her. "What.." blurted out Jomi, as Mijo looked at her, still having that small dark smile. "Come, thousand times.. Here for it all. And... you were here every time I went on temper tantrums by holding you down like an object, and even at my worst, you.. stayed. Even if it's just to keep me sane and grounded." Mijo put his hands on his chest. "I admit, I'm.. I've been.. abusing whatever this shit we got." confessed Mijo, as Jomi's breathing quickens.

"Jomi, I'm serious, I know we usually don't have the cajones to say 'no'. But, Jomi.." Mijo puts his right hand up. "..Are you totally fine with me  being.. that romantic? In a weird way, this counts as self-cest, since I created you in the light world, not expecting you'd actually exist as your own.. self, and.. since both of us acknowledged yet didn't address our.." Mijo clasps his hands in a sort-of praying manner. "..imbalance. I hate, this.. crazy thing I'm always making for myself."

"You don't deserve this, and.." Mijo thinks back to Cara and Arlen, then Cara to Jomi. "..this cycle has to end somewhere." 

"..."

"I.." Jomi speaks up. "I'm.." Jomi hesitates. "It's funny, Mijo.. You're.. never in the side that has to respond to this stuff.." said Jomi, as she stopped for a moment to regulate her breathing. "I know my story from your side, you were always easy in just.. explaining and being self-aware of your problems.. You had experience in that diary in the light world that's my home here in the dark world." Jomi lays her body on the sofa. "So, what, Mijo? What.. if I do say, 'no'?" asked Jomi, as she looked at Mijo, laying on her left side.

_"Won't you regress again..?"_

"..."

Mijo is silent. Then he stands up. "I don't know, what do you want me to do?" asked Mijo, as he paced around. "Like, I don't want to leave this world, but I have to be proactive, a—and maybe I'm just losing my mind, but I— might be _projecting_ a little of my desires because I've been moving between this and the light world's school for so damn long, I give myself delusions of grandeur and entitlement?" rambles Mijo, as he turns to Jomi, stopping. "Maybe I'm tired, burned out or whatever— it doesn't excuse anything!! Yet, I remain here, hopelessly still rambling to my abused OC, in hopes she knows something I don't!" Mijo says, in a rushed, raised voice before sighing and sitting down.

"Is this a birthday celebration or an intervention..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shrugged. "I dunno, is it more interesting to ramble on about our life's problems than discussing celebrations??" replied Mijo, in a sarcastic yet still irritated manner. "You.. brought it up." said Jomi, as she sat up. "I know." said Mijo, as he closed his eyes. 

Then, he smiled and looked at Jomi. This look spelled of his usual personality. Jomi was going to say something about his avoidance and mask but she also really wanted to move on. "So, Jomi, what about your gift?" Mijo grinned. "I know I know, but.. then again, you did mention an improved potion~" he added, as Jomi sighed and nodded. "Yeah, uh.. let's go to my lab." Both stood up as Mijo followed Jomi.

_Awkward minutes later..._

"..."

"So, I'm about done, Mijo.. I just have to do some more refinements in the hormone replacement and gene editing department.. Ooh, yeah.. Expect this like.. this week, I promise." said Jomi, as Mijo nodded and looked around her lab. "Jomi, is this IS the best lab in Kultima? Because, aside from my selfish request, theoretically, this is the best way to research like.. whatever science elemental magic, and.. apparently gene editing has in common." said Mijo, as Jomi thought about it and shook her head.

"Um.. how do I explain this.." said Jomi as she looked around her. "Uh, so.. in a simple summary, I am the only one with the knowledge of what's in here, and you.. Of course, there's a lot of stuff in Kultima and Dajovy that's advanced, but for example, this one's a personal request from you, so I get you to get stuff for this. But, since Dajovy functions similarly to uh.. from what I've read about pre-1980s but before any major advancements in video-audio information." Jomi shifted around as she thought about it more, stopping herself from saying anything.

"So, you have nukes?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shifted her head side-to-side. "Does the robot count...? Or, uh.. you? Or me actually, you know.." answered Jomi, as Mijo chuckled. "Well, it's good that the country's last resort is an outside lightner or their own leader.. but, whatever." Mijo shrugged. "I'm not here to question how your world even somehow keeps rolling in peacefully, but.." Mijo thought about it. "..on how, exactly you'd implement the Nuevo Leon expansion, and if the robot's built, the reclaiming of all of the snow plains into actually livable areas.."

Jomi nodded. "Oh, ah yeah.." Jomi smiled. "T—that's for another time, we should focus on now.. I.. we.. did defeat Arlen.. a—and, I want to formally celebrate it. Since, you.." Mijo nodded. "I know, I know.. I.. uh.. got lost in the sauce a bit, anyway.." Mijo thinks about Arlen. "Is Cara fine, anyway? I know she's like.. an abyss queen, but.." Mijo chuckled awkwardly. "..I kinda lost the right to judge _her_ actions after what I almost did."

"She's fine, I think." answered Jomi, as she faintly smiled. "Just.. needs some time, I guess. Even the doctor doesn't allow me to see her, which means something." added Jomi, as Mijo pondered. "She might have built some good will, but if this is another case of hiding.." warned Mijo, before sighing. "We'll just have to see, I guess." finished Mijo, as Jomi gestured for them to leave the lab so they do.

_Jomi's office, @ 15:30_

As the two arrive back at the office, they just so happen to stumble into Rhida, speaking awkwardly with Ikari. 

"So.. you're his like ex?" asked Ikari, as Rhida shifted and looked around the room. "Um.. yeah-ish? I—I dunno, girl.." Rhida sighs before jolting up when she hears the two go in. "Jomi?! M—Mijo..?" exclaimed Rhida, as she stood up and hugged Jomi, then looked at Mijo awkwardly before looking away. "A—ah, Rhida.. you've returned." Jomi nodded. "Right, um.. Ikari?" Jomi sat down on her very cushioned armchair. "Oh, uh yeah, I'm here for Mijo." replied Ikari, as Rhida sat back down with Ikari while Mijo placed himself opposite of them.

"So.. uh," Rhida looks at Mijo, then Jomi. "I came here because I came to celebrate your birthday.. but.." Rhida scratches her head. "I never actually.. asked your birthday, haha.." Rhida looks at Jomi, apologetically. "Sorry, um.. but when is it..?" asked Rhida, as Jomi looked at Mijo, then Ikari before sighing acceptant. "September 11." said Jomi, as Rhida and Ikari's eyes widened, knowing what happened in that day, in the broader internet context.

### Author's Note:

It's going to be eh canon, but if nothing in canon contradicts what has been told here, then it's canon, but if there is? You can take these events as a somewhat canon divergent yet still telling in a somewhat general way what happened in these dates. A lot of cursing, if you couldn't tell from the title being A.F. Day..

Also another crossover chapter~ Mizo/Rika and Main, hah!

I need a better name lol for both of them, like.. Mupho and Iota??? LoL anyway, enjoy!

centimering = inching (i think)

_All occured in the night of September 22, Monday Class Suspensions due to a Typhoon..._

_JUST ANOTHER FUCKING DAY!!!!!_

"God damn it—" Rika tries very hard to not smack her keyboard, but then she can't even hit her closet doors anymore, as she suspects it's getting loose and might break off. She *really* does not want to ask her dad, and cautiously just lets it be there in hopes that if her dad noticed while going through her roo, maybe he'd just contemplate and conclude it's through use. "..." Rika sighs as she slumps on her 'stupid' plastic chair as she realized she literally had no way to let out anger, whether justified big systems, small petty things, or just the stress of school and art.

"FUCKKKKKKKK" Rika let out a scream as she smacked her head on the table, centimering towards her keyboard her forehead the only one really touching the table. "This.. is.. so fucking.. ugh.." Rika looks down, seeing nothing but the red cement that is her floor. Rika looks up. "I'm so fucking.. tired, and I don't know why I am doing any shit I can if I just do shit and that shit so fucking bad... godddd!!!" Rika stands up abruptly, feeling the plastic white chair move the makeshift carpet to where it barely even covered the cement repairs since apparently, not even her room was safe from the outside mess. Oh, and the chair tumbled to it's back, causing the pillows to spill as well.

She took a second to breathe before fixing it with that grit and focus you'd see from a woman who is one step away from killing you. Then she sat down on her bed, laying down on it as she contemplated whether she gave up doing anything at all, go and 'goon' to make herself think that life isn't so bad with lesbians together, but she can also just draw, but damn it if she thinks she can even pick up that digital pen and draw something worth showing to anyone. She was already done with one, right? The one that took a week, and featured her favourite pink-haired Evernight girl strolling in this part of the wintery city.

Honestly, she thought, she could probably make some money, but then the deadlines, the human interactions, even though it was necessary for a functioning society she felt burdened immensely. Anyways, it's all in her website, and maybe some social media, she got a few likes, and some compliments from her family and friends but was that enough to satiate this creative block wedged in her head... "NAH!" Rika sat up. "Is there a damn good reason why I should do my asynchronous tasks?" She remembered to when Mizo, who she was beginning to talk to again, but still a bit distant said, "I.. suggest doing your math ADM's on the day. Trust me, they're the only ones that take the most time, and worth the most... for some reason, I get it, I hate it too, but hey, you're just the new curriculum's test subject."

"FUCK YOU, MIZO!" said Rika with disdain, yet for some reason, even though she was this mad and irritated she wasn't exactly the type to confront her ex-boyfriend, now just friend and rant.. well, she would.. but not now. Ever since, that day, she swore not to burden Mizo with her stupid problems, and just focus on managing it herself. "It's fine!" She thinks, even as she clearly sees herself hating herself even more over the weeks of constant school projects, group activities and other bullshittery she can't possibly even unpack. All she can get were hugs and kisses from Mizo, which... while nice didn't really comfort her deep down, and she felt guilty.. "Anyway! No more trauma, let's move on!" She says, even as she felt herself stung by her deep ruminations.

"I swear, if I ever get the time, I will make a webcomic, and it's going to be peak!!" reassured Rika to herself, even as her writing drafts remain unfinished, her art scattered around the various fandoms, and her website's only progress being Mizo maintaining it monthly since he's the programmer of that operation. "It's fine, everything's fine.. I can do this and not sleep.." Rika has proven this will either cause her parents to crash out on her for not doing it earlier, since it's 20:00, or she'll hate the morning and day so much she might not even go to school. "Ah. I have so many choices~!" She says, sarcastically, even as her hands physically shake.

"Orrrr maybe maybe—" Rika wraps her arms around herself. "Maybe there'll be a typhoon and kill me, suspend school, or even better..." Rika looks down at the mattress cover of pink and unicorns... "Flood and destroy all my sketchbooks! That's right! Character development, you want me to have it, right GOD??!!" Rika looks at the reader (again, that's you.) before shaking her head. "AH? Who gives a fuck, even if there is some manifesting god, I'm sure *they* won't hesitate to *save* me once I'm in peril..." Rika says all sarcastically, she doesn't know if she believes anything she's saying. "FUCK THAT'S RIGHT!!!!! I'M SOOOO GLADDDD THAT I HAVE TO DO SHIT AT HOME???" Rika suddenly sprang, got to her new black guitar and jams.

"HEY HEY HEY LOOK AT ME, I AM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND I'M READY TO RUIN YOUR KID'S LIFE BY GIVING THEM PROJECTS SPANNING OVER WEEKS ABOUT 'CREATIVE' APPLICATION OF WORKS!!! I'M SO GLAD TO BE SO TIRED ALL THE TIME! I'M SO HAPPY I AM DOING MY MATHEMATICS NOTEBOOK INSTEAD OF FUCKING ENJOYING MYSELF! HEY HEY LET'S GO! I'M SO IN BLISS FROM ALL OF MY UNHEALTHY COPING IT FEELS LIKE I'M BLEEDING AND DIZZY AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME! WOOOOOO!"

Rika does a sick acoustic guitar riff before immediately ruining it by palying random notes with random intervals until she stops. "God, I love my life~" Rika lays down on her bed as she crawls and grabs her phone from her table. "Might as well start.." Rika finds a video and plays it as she stands up and goes to her desktop.

"U.S. ICE... CIA Torture.... Deport... Trump... End secret detention..."

Rika barely even consciously what she's listening too, yet unconsciously she can't play the same videos without getting annoyed. She sighs, as she opens up the website where the asynchronous school tasks are posted, and groans before clicking on the first one she picked randomly.

_Dark Skies, show me the light.._

"Dear.. diary." Mizo writes. "September 22.." Mizo looks at his phone. "Rika.. she seemed.. too nice again. Like she's hiding something." Mizo sighs. "It's whatever. I just reminded her of the ADM's this day, it's fine." Mizo hesitates to write, before going again. "I find myself.. exhausted once more." Mizo shrugged. "Even as I'm supposed to expect these hell weeks to be normal.. I find myself, lacking.." Mizo looks at his Math notebook. "..this took me the whole day. I was planning to work on the school interview in Filipino, spruce up my novel's wiki a bit, and maybe take some time off." Mizo sighs. "I suppose not everyone can be perfect, yet.." Mizo grips his pen tight. "...no one is spared, as their grades stab their very being."

Mizo looks at his diary and takes a deep breath. "I suppose when you push and squish your student's timetable, keep pushing them to their limits, and make their online and offline situations worse, there comes a point where violence in the streets is a byproduct of corrupt discontent." wrote Mizo, as he closed his diary. "So.. tired, but I have to publish these, and check Rika's website again, make sure her art is well shown.." Mizo gestures to his novels, some in hard drives, some piling up in his room as manuscripts. Mizo gets up to work, getting his notebook and shoving inside his backpack, "Tomorrow is another day."

_Dajovy's Skies, they finally show the stars, after all these years.._

"Mijo? Rhida..?" Jomi saw the two, somewhat close, but in a way you wouldn't know they're currently lovers working through separation and obsession. Upon a hillside, the three are watching over the night city, some still enjoying it while others prepare for daylight. "Jomi.. why are you here?" asked Mijo, as Jomi sighed and sat down next to the two, to her left Rhida, and Mijo. "I.. was just looking out, at the night, and saw you two on these.. hillsides." Mijo nodded, and looked at Jomi, seeing Jomi hasn't even switched out of her pajamas.

"Are you happy with our life?" asked Mijo, to the two as silence broke, but Rhida answered, "Dark World, Light World.. Both?" Mijo replied, "Both, and maybe get more specific." Rhida nods, as Jomi answered second, "I.. guess, the situation is improving.. abyss magic is controllable again, Arlen is sealed, Cara's.. well, she and that doctor.. well, it's better to fight a known enemy than an unknown one, hm?" Mijo immediately replied, "I.. detest that queen, and her doctor, however.. ugh." Mijo shook his head. "I.. learnt my lesson, it is up to you, as always, Jomi." Mijo looks away. "She's.. a lesser threat than Manecony's Saturday, anyway."

"For me.." Mijo and Jomi go quiet. "I guess.. it's been the usual problems, Mijo, haha.." Rhida looks around, "School stress, this.. whole mess with Arlen and.. Dajovy.. I.." Rhida looks at Mijo, then at Jomi. "...It's been.. a while since, I got some time to chill, and let my hair down.." Rhida sighed long and deep. "Hehe, even your birthday was stressful, um.. sorry, Mijo." Jomi and Mijo nodded quietly. "Weeks.. pass.. and.. sometimes, just.." Rhida turned her eyes to Mijo. "..I want to forget all the bad for a moment, and rest on you, while we look at the stars here.. and.. be content in our.. everything." Rhida looks away. "I.. know you, you too.. want this, but.. burdened, huh?"

Mijo nodded. Rhida continued, "Heh, guess that's life..." Rhida chuckled. "It's funny, we only had time because of a typhoon." Mijo added sarcastically, "Almost as if having the school part makes this much much harder to deal with." Rhida acknowledged it but she kept on, "Yeah, I guess.. I should thank the light world weather for our meet again.." Rhida chuckled. "I.. wish we had more time, Mijo.. Jomi." Rhida stretched her arms. "More time, here.. enjoying what little pleasures.. remain, but.." Rhida stands up. "I.. have to go sleep and prepare my things for school.." Rhida looks at Mijo, "I.. hope you do the same, Mijo." The two look at each other, almost contemplating whether to kiss, hug, before Mijo stood up and hugged her, as she felt his.. warm electrifying presence over her icy powers, before he pulled away.

"Jomi?" Rhida looked at Jomi, standing up. "Um.." Jomi shook hands with Rhida awkwardly as the other two chuckled. "Haha, well.. goodbye, see you.. soon, you two." Rhida offered a faint shy smile, before walking away as the other two remained. "Keep your sanity, Mijo.." commented Jomi, as she looked to the castle. "Soon, we'll be able to enjoy our time spent.. like these moments, without you.." Jomi lets Mijo finish her words in his mind. "..anyway, these words made me feel tired finally, so.. um.. good night, Mijo~" Jomi nodded at Mijo, as he shot back one too, before she left. "Guess I.. was too alone, to see what they were thinking, doing, and.. ugh, I feel.. so stupid, focusing on myself.. and obsessively.. I.. should.. work to.. not be like this. So, when pressures come in, I.. don't *hurt* them.. again." Mijo puts his hands to his chest before sighing with determination, releasing his emotions with a long deep sigh. Then.. he left.

## Author's Note:

A small spinoff, a release. I.. uh, well.. it's bound to be something I should have written for a post-Arlen Dajovy and the in-between weirdly detached Mizo/Rika stuff. I combined them into one 'cause their creator, me.. She's very much tired, and would like to express that while connecting to lore, and not committing much to lore. Anyway, I think that's about it for this short spinoff, goodbye, good day, and peace~!

_January 07._

_At Honrato High, where the sun shines brightly on a cold January afternoon.._

Mijo, in his school uniform, looks high upon the blue sky, absent of massive cloud formations. 

_"Who am I?"_

_Sudden Flashback!_

"Jomi," called Mijo as the two stand on the edge of a cliff, in the dark world, near Jomi's Castle Walls. "Who am I?" asked Mijo, the two staring at the dark starry sky. "Uh," Jomi looks at Mijo. "You're.. the Lightbringer, Hero of Dajovy, and the First Knight of Kultima." listed out Jomi, before looking back at the sky. "But.. you're also whoever you present yourself to be."

_Back to Honrato._

Wind blows as Mijo looks down to his right hand, feeling the wind flow through the palm of his hands, as his uniform flutters. Mijo looks forward and sees fellow students walk around normally, chatting and holding papers. "Appearances, Expectations and Promises." Mijo nods. "These form me." Mijo looks around himself, observing that there are teachers carrying their laptops and other students filming something.  "The man of power, light and _hero_ of legends." Mijo smiled faintly. "Achieving glory, yet.." Mijo looks at the school gate, from his perspective, hidden by trees and seats.

"..who do I share this with?"

_Earlier, Front of Vesalius Classroom.._

"Ah, andito ka na!" exclaimed Ikari, as she looked up from her desk, unamused. "Yeah. I'm late, so what? Just.. give me it." Mijo extended his right hand out. "The.. dream-catcher keychain thingy—pink." added Mijo, as Ikari went to her bag and looked for it. Ikari found it and gave it to Mijo, for a moment their fingers touched.  "Thanks.." Mijo put it on his I.D.'s lanyard attachment. "Heh, be a _bit_ more grateful..?" asked Ikari, as Mijo groaned and replied, "Thank you.. very much. Uh, best friend..!" with a slight smile as she nodded amusedly and let him go.

_Back to the Present._

Now, Mijo is holding the pink dream-catcher on his left hand, reminiscing. "A hero's path is lonely.." said Mijo, as he let the keychain fall. "But, does it have to be?" asked Mijo, as behind him, two figures approach. Mijo waits for them to be beside him before speaking, "Jomi and Ascilla..? What are you doing in the light world?" asked Mijo, as Jomi and Ascilla both looked at him in unison.

"You were so _sad_ I was dragged in here.. My fields were flooded, and I was washed away.." Ascilla huffed. "Keep **your** mind stable, I live in it!" Jomi looked at Ascilla disapprovingly before sighing. "I was.. napping, then.. I woke up here." Jomi put her right hand on his left shoulder. "I.. usually can't access you here unless it's very.. intense, so.. what's.. why are.. uh.." Jomi looks at Ascilla looking at her before continuing, "Why did we get summoned?"

"Pre-Adult Crisis?" said Mijo, as he started walking. "It just keeps.. gnawing my brain." Mijo brushes the scalp of his hair. "Relationships, Bonds... It keeps bothering me why I don't feel them." Jomi interjects, "..not even like, Rhida? Or.. Lauvielle?" Mijo is a bit louder. "Especially them. I feel obligated, yet this is supposed to be coming naturally..?" asked Mijo, as Ascilla answered, "Yeah, but.. you're not most people, Mijo. You got like, two to three familiars at this point, by the time you're older, you're going to have a harem—" Jomi stops the three from walking, stepping in front of Ascilla. "Hey!"

"What? Relax." Ascilla says. "I'm just saying." Mijo looks at Jomi, as she sighs and goes beside Mijo again as they continue walking. "You're right though. I'm not like most people, and.. that's good **and** bad." Mijo stops. "Heh, who even in the world has you two following me like ghosts?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shrugged and Ascilla chuckled. "You. But, really?" Ascilla's face leaned closer to Mijo. "Sure you don't have any.. thing?"

"Just hold on, I'm.. trying to word it." said Mijo, as the three continued walking around and around the school. "Being powerful, able to fight enemies, and focus on fighting..." Mijo looks at Jomi. "Can't be helped that I'm a student. Sometimes, I want to stay over in the dark world, but.. I.." Mijo shudders. "What if I get stuck in? I don't have the light world's internet there, the world's everything is just.. I can never.. live comfortably there. At least here, it's a mess but it's mine." Jomi replies, "I can help you if that happens, but.. yeah, and.. there's already **me** there. We don't even know how me, Ascilla and Cara being directly related to your imagination implies, since it requires a lot of research on you that—"

"—I don't care about." Mijo finishes. "You can speculate, but I don't need to know. It.. _just_ happens." Ascilla butted in, "Jomi, it's fine~ It's called magic for a reason. Besides, knowing that would stress our beloved Mijo here, the power to create beings.." Ascilla smiles. "**Dangerous.**" Jomi nods as Mijo continues, "Have I been given responsibility too early?" The other two nodded. "Guessed as much." responded Mijo, as he sighs. "It'd be fun. And.. it is! But I was.. I.." Mijo shakes his head. "Fantasy exists in our heads, but once they come to life, the more complicated, messy and.." Mijo looks at Ascilla. "..real they are. And now, I'm walking with two of myself, my longings.. My.. better selves," Mijo holds the other two's closest hands.

"I don't know whether to feel happy." Mijo holds on tighter before pulling back. "Okay, but.." Mijo touches his flat chest. "..I should address this." Jomi and Ascilla look at each other before looking at Mijo. _"You're trans."_  said Jomi and Ascilla together. "Ah—what?!" exclaimed Mijo, as Jomi sighs. "You have requested transformation potions, specifically for.. male to female in a weird vague way, and it's been on and off for a year..." explained Jomi as Ascilla added, "Remember? I was literally _you_ for a couple of days."

"Coincidences! My next familiar will be a man.." responded Mijo, as Jomi and Ascilla shook their heads in disagreement. "Nope..! Ascilla exists as proof!" emphasized Jomi as Mijo groaned and reluctantly nodded. "Fine..! Okay, then what?" asked Mijo, as he looked around the school again. "I can't change here—" Mijo puts on a mocking tone. "I'm but a child with no agency to their hair and nails! Having a prestigious academic reputation is better than letting kids be kids and express themselves!"

"Ohh.." Ascilla looks at her nails. "Is this why mine are permanently black?" Mijo lets out an exasperated shout before sighing. "It doesn't matter what I feel, it matters if I do something about it." 

Ascilla stood in front of Mijo, and smiled at him. "Then go~!" Ascilla fades away, relieved. "Bye..! I'm sleeping.." Jomi waved goodbye before fading away.

"..That was so sudden." commented Mijo, before walking away.

---

_Anyways, fight scene!_

_January 09._

"New year.." Mijo's left eye lightens up with intense light orange pyro. "New me!!" Mijo's right eye lightens up with dark blue electro. Mijo summons his old katana, 'Denkitekijiyū Noken'. "I embrace contradiction." Mijo unsheathed the blade, feeling the electro spark again. "This time.." Mijo looks at the vast amount of abyss monsters surrounding him at a part of Nuevo Leon not reclaimed yet. "..I am all of me, the hero, the pessimist and the broken!"

Mijo looks around him, as the abyss monsters were summoned due to his.. 'loud' appearance.

"Lightbringer!!" one monster roared. "I will exterminate you!!"

---

**_Averted Cataclysm: THE RUMBLING_**

_January 16._

Mijo was walking, looking down, his hands on his pants' pockets. "What an awful day.." Mijo sighs. "Got two hours of sleep, quizzes failed.." Mijo shakes his head. "Let's just hope there's no problems in the dark world.." mumbled Mijo as he was heading to the table where the dark world was. Fourth floor or that building behind the stage of Honrato's Gymnasium.

Then as he was about to climb the stairs, there was an explosion, then a _rumbling._

"Huh? A—another dark world?!" Mijo rushed to get to the middle of the gymnasium. That's where he saw the feet of a titan figure near the Blue Building (where his classroom currently is).

"TITAN??! W—what—not even a dark—okay." Mijo's sling bag fades away as he tries to summon his sword but he only gets to summon a normal odachi. He doesn't have his elemental magic, but it seems that around him, the people that survived the initial titan summon have weapons like battle axes and halberds.. which against a **Titan**.. isn't ideal.

Then out of nowhere, **THE RUMBLING by SiM** starts playing?!

"H—hey! Who asked them to—" said Mijo before the Titan started moving. "Ah—fuck." Mijo grabbed his sheath and odachi and tried to quickly sheath and unsheathe his blade to cause damage. It sliced the Titan's lower leg but he was knocked by the other foot to the building behind him, knocking him out.

When he woke up, he was covered in rubble, but he has his dark world form now. "Ughh.. what was that guy..? Why didn't I have my..?" Mijo summoned his greatsword, 'Lightbringer'. "..yeah. This one." Mijo stands up, shakes off the dust and looks around. "This.. isn't the school..? It's not even Kultima.." commented Mijo as he started to walk around. Then he saw something in the distance, between destroyed homes and trees lies the dark fountain, and the colossal titans defending it. "Woah! That's them!" Mijo sprouts his golden wings and floats to the titans (the wings are decorative). 

_BEWARE!_

Mijo meets the Titan in the eyes and summons his mirage lances to pierce through it's eyes and then moves to the nape of it and does a big slash with his sword, beheading the titan accidentally as he brought his sword up then down, smashing downwards, cutting through flesh easily. Once he hits the ground, the ground shakes as the titans lock onto him.

"Too easy. Lemme make it fun."

Mijo unsummons his sword and uses his magic to copy Urda's double swords, pairing with an omni-directional mobility gear to connect to the Titans to. "Oh, best part about this..?" Mijo taunts to the titans. "It can attach to literal air." Mijo flies by launching the ODM's grapple hooks into a building but instead of attacking to the crumbling cement, it attaches to the air in front of it and flies Mijo to multiple positions around the titan. "Woohoo!! This is so much fun! Wish my friends were here though."

Mijo narrowed his eyes. "Oh, right. Because of you all, they're not.." Mijo clashes his swords before going in and using his ol' lightning fast slashes to decimate the Titans in ten seconds. When he goes out of speed mode, he attaches himself to somewhere in front of the titans then summons a camera to float nearby as he takes a cool shot, before he uses his ODM gear to go to the camera, take the physical photo and smile as he then attaches his hooks onto the fountain and flies towards it, his right hand about to close it using his heart and his left hand holding the camera and the photo.

Mijo wakes up, laying down on the floor of the gymnasium, his arms and legs spread out. "That.. was fun." Mijo stands up as he noticed something was in his left pocket. "Oh?" Mijo grabs it and sees himself on the right with his ODM form while on the left, the Titans looking at him, the cuts he had formed just beginning to affect reality. Mijo smiled with a little blush. "Niiice~ THIS IS COOL!!!!" Mijo whisper-shouts before realizing he's in the middle of the gymnasium with other students practicing for MAPEH stuff or just chatting.

".. don't worry about me, hehe." Mijo puts the photo into his sling bag, which was near his body and was just on the floor until he grabbed it. "Got a story to write down and tell.." said Mijo confidently before looking at where the fourth floor of that building would be, behind the gymnasium. "I'll come over soon, Jomi." he says, before leaving.

### Author's Note:

proof-of-concept. mostly to shape how Mijo developed his character, and what Rhida is, and what's happening to them or something..

so like the last scene is disconnected with the last one, because I ran out of motivation. Yes.

_January 19. Jomi's Castle, near Dajovy City._

Mijo sits with Rhida on the Castle Balcony, as they sip coffee (stolen directly from Jomi!).

"Hey." Mijo looks at Rhida, who was still staring off. "Yeah?" Rhida acknowledged, but she was still looking at the view of the city and frozen wasteland surrounding it. 

"I wish I wasn't me." Mijo reflected as a flashback went through their minds.

_July 11, 2023._

"Rhida!" Mijo hugged Rhida as they looked around. "Mijo.. hah, almost.. thought you didn't make it." Rhida's eyes almost tear up before pushing her head down his chest. "..relax, I'm fine. I got high scores, I defeated Cara, freed Jomi.." Mijo meets her eyes as she looks at his face. "..and survived. That's.. good right? We did an awesome adventure, met new people, and.. we did something great." Mijo looks at the gynnasium's exit, outside the air conditioned Honrato moving-up ceremony. "..even if no one else remembers. 'cause that's what friends are for!" Mijo smiles at Rhida, surprising her slightly, making her look away and blush slightly.

"..and we're?" Rhida asks, before Mijo hugs her. "Something more! Obviously! I was.. just being inspirational, hehe.." Mijo pulls back and holds her hand. "I.. I don't know how to.. love you, so.. teach me, okay~?" Rhida nods excitedly. "Yeah, after this ceremony.."

_Present._

"..I don't know how I got here." Mijo sets down his coffee and grips the sheath of his blade. "We.." Mijo looks at Rhida, still neutral as he shakes his head. "I.. felt happy. I.. had a set future; save dark worlds, love to my best ability and have fun.." Mijo covers his face with his hands. "I.. thought, even with problems, we'll fix it, together.. _but_.." Mijo trailed off as his voice cracked at the last word.

"Ang.. cruel ng fate, di ba?" Rhida spoke up. "Kala ko, kaya ko 'to. Di ko na kailangang mag-asa.." Rhida puts her right hand to her chest. "Pwede kong ma-push down ang aking ibang mga damdamin, just.. you can.. _fix me._" Rhida smiled faintly. "We _were_ happy, at least."

"..were we?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked down and answered, "..yes." Rhida looked at Mijo. "You weren't..?" Mijo's eyes seem to grow darker, as he hesitates to answer. "Maybe I was, but.. those moments.. can never be brought back."

_FLASHBACK! September 7, 2023._

"Happy birthday Mijo!" Rhida greeted Mijo, as they hugged and went over to a secluded place to chat. "Thanks.. I guess." said Mijo, as they stood there, awkwardly looking around them. "..Um, Rhida..?" called out Mijo, as Rhida stepped back for some reason in surprise. "Oh! Yeah, yeah..! Yung um.. gift? I.." Rhida nervously fiddled with her school dress. "I.. *will* have one! I'm a rich gal, I have friends in high places!"

"Um, I.." Mijo looks at Rhida, before stepping closer. "I think it's fine. You just being here is enough." Rhida gasped, was flushed but didn't notice it as she insisted, "N—no! I get that! I still want to give you something..! I just um, forgot.." Rhida looked up to Mijo's face. "I was thinking about this whole week and.. and I couldn't figure out what you wanted, so I wanted to ask you and couldn't get myself to say it and—"

"Rhida." Mijo called out, stopping her rambling as she shook her head. "I—! I.. sorry. It's just, I want to know, if you wanna go out with me, later.. Maybe I can just libre you for today?" Mijo smiled and nodded. "Okay, sure. Wait for me near the gate, same with you." Rhida nodded. "Okay? Okay!!" Rhida hugged Mizo tightly before leaving, giddy yet shy.

_Present._

"I.. wonder why we.. drifted after September.." commented Mijo, as he looked disappointed. Rhida replies, "We had different sections, and.. I didn't know until the second cataclysm you were.." Mijo interrupts, "..in hell? I didn't know that either. Didn't bother to tell you," Mijo puts his hand on his forehead, bothered. "I was so sure of myself, and that the adventure was fun, but.." Mijo chuckled darkly. "Guess there's more to adventure once you're in the _thick of it._"

---

"Mijo!" Rhida gasped as Mijo straddled her as she was still sitting, as the two's faces were ever closer. "We haven't even.." Mijo plays with her hair. "..done this, in a while." Rhida was looking at Mijo's face before burying her face on his chest. "If we're doing this, get off of me so I can hug you properly.." Rhida said as her voice was muffled. "Okay." Mijo gets off of her lap as Rhida is faintly blushing. "..you smell good by the way." mumbled Rhida, before Mijo could respond, she hugged him.

"Wish you stayed.." said Mijo, as Rhida added, "I wish I could.." as she tightened her hug. The two pull back. "Hey." Mijo fixes his hair anxiously. "W—what?" asked Rhida, a bit amused. Mijo leaned forward. "A bit dark out, let's go to our bedroom before sleeping for the night." Rhida looked at him for half a minute before her eyes widened. "Ah.. here? What.. what are you trying to do?" asked Rhida as Mijo leaned in and kissed her on the lips, as she gasped but reciprocated, accidentally pushing them down to the floor. "Hey! Uh.." said Mijo, as Rhida was heavily red.

"I—sorry!" Rhida got off of him and helped him back up. "I.. that's.." Mijo was a bit surprised Rhida overpowered him before Rhida grabbed his left hand and dragged him. "Let's go! I.. want to settle _this_, there." The two walked to their shared bedroom's door, opened and closed it, as Jomi, who was walking by, was confused before shrugging it off.

_Honrato High. February 11, 2026_

"Can I ask you, Ascilla?" asked Mijo, as they walk at the pathways, Ascilla being invisible to everyone but Mijo. "Can I change the past?" Ascilla's lazy smile turned serious. "What..? I.." Ascilla unfurls her umbrella. "I.. probably can, but.." Ascilla paused before asking, "Wait, *you?"* Mijo nods. "When it comes down to it, I'll be the one doing the change. You have your own life, Ascilla. It.. feels bad if I ask you to do so. We are now separate beings, we just have a connection." Mijo looks to the school's hustle and bustle. "I can change the past myself by merging my lightning speed and space cutting into the sword, infusing it with enough elemental energy to be able to cut a portal to a designated time and space." Mijo turns his hands into fists. "..of course, it requires a purpose and unyielding will, lest it fail."

"Oh, yeah. That's why I—" Ascilla cut herself off, then asked. "Why? What exactly do you want to change?" Mijo looks at her and continues walking silently before suddenly stopping in front of an old classroom he recognized. "We know this place. But, I kept the feelings of it. You just know what." Ascilla nods. "Honestly, speaking to me is making less sense. If you're so determined to go back to three years ago, then do it. It's not like I have personally done it, I can manipulate time, yes, but I don't use it to change and meddle stuff." Ascilla steps back from Mijo. "Find someone other than a darkner or familiar. Find a friend," Ascilla adjusts her hair. "Please." Mijo looks at her and sighs. "I can't be mad at you for saying this, it is what I was thinking too. But," Mijo smacks the door. "they're not here right..? They're all off on their own journeys, without me! Everything's fine. I have my own."

Ascilla turns away from Mijo. "You know I have no words for you." Ascilla smiled. "Contact me when you're thinking of having fun," Ascilla side-eyes Mijo. "but me? I'm the part that refuses to be bound by anything. Go solve your own problems, there's a reason why you still exist and not a woman with an umbrella walking the infinite dark cosmos without worries." Ascilla prepares her umbrella. "See you. Call Jomi if you want to get advice from yourself, but you know she's quite busy these days, don't disturb a girl on her princess journey, alright~?" Ascilla disappears with red-black mist as Mijo sighs and closes his eyes, as he opens it in a blue two story building, with him at the top, seemingly was projecting himself out.

Mijo sighs as he checks his phone. *12:29.*

---

"Throughout the light and dark, I alone am the honoured one."

"But, I wish someone was beside me in that throne."

_01:24_

Mijo was walking at the school still, this time in his physical form. The wind blows as he appreciates the cold yet wants to be even colder.

"Life is... like memories floating and fading. I wanted to remember them, but.. I can't. My power.. it's.. excruciating."

_FLASHBACKS!_

_Scene 1_

"I.. love you.. Mijo." said Rhida, as she kissed Mijo, making him flustered for the first time in a while, before Rhida pulled back, still leaning on him. "T—that's.. okay.." said Mijo, as Rhida looked at him very deeply, like she was waiting for his response. "Rhida.. I.." trailed off Mijo, as he allowed his sense of self to be regained for a minute. "I.. love you too." said Mijo, as he was unexpectedly hugged tightly by her, as tight as a weakened Rhida can, anyway. "T—thank you.. so much.." murmured Rhida, as she put her face close to Mijo.

_Scene 2_

*"Edge of Sacrifice!"* Mijo uses his katana to quickly sheath and unsheathe to cut through the robot many times before it's armor broke and remained operational. He moved through like lightning, cutting through space like glass as it shattered. He defeated it but he couldn't say a word to the woman he cherished like a friend before she jumped up, with her pistols to fire something he didn't see.

The last thought going through his mind was, "Wish.. Rhida could've seen her.. and, me.."

_Scene 3_

*"Edges of Sacrifice: Light."* Mijo uses his katana to deflect and parry a dark swordswoman's many slashes as he used combined pyro and electro to melt through the ice trying to encompass and trap him. The ice also contained electro that zapped through his clothes and into his skin but he continued. Mijo screamed as he kept going and going through all the ice, many seconds pass as he feels his body numb and shake but he continued. Until he finally broke through the last layer, saw the swordswoman and stabbed her straight at her heart. **"Jomi! Shit!"**

_Scene 4_

"You're.. alive! I.. didn't think it'd work.." Mijo hugged Jomi. "It was all thanks to all of you guys.. I.. shouldn't have given up." Mijo shook his head. "It's fine! We can talk about it once we're done fixing things here." Urda approached on one hand a pistol, the other a cutlass. "Hey. Let's go, our friends are still fighting." Urda was looking at Mijo. "Why so serious? Once we get Jomi out, me and her can take care of the remaining abyss monsters." asked Mijo before putting his arms around her shoulder, which makes her blush slighty. "Because— I want.. us to be safe.. Ah—I mean, all of us, heh. So, we can enjoy our remaining school year, eating and drinking, haha.." answered Urda, looking down, as Mijo nodded as the three started walking, Jomi following with a smile.

_Scene 5_

"URDA!!!" Mijo was looking back at his group running to him before turning back and trying to punch an abyssal monster that suddenly appeared out of an empty lot of the school that used to contain old buildings of the faculty and miscellaneous objects. But, he and the rest of them didn't have powers so the monster directly stabbed Mijo at the heart.

*"Who do you love, Rhida or Urda?"*

"Why in the fuck do I have to decide—!!" Mijo was trying to pull the spear out in some sort of weird void. "Also, who the fu—AAGH—?!" Mijo felt the blade move, making it hurt so much more than it did remaining still. "Urda's my best friend, Rhida's my girlfriend. Is there anything wrong with that?! I.. think I am pretty open when it comes down to it, so just **let me out—AGGHH!!**" Mijo slowly moves the spear out of his chest. "I try to be there for both, okay?! It's all so stressing these days, school's ramping up, and catacylsms slowly turn from being a dark world reality to a mixing of worlds that I can't—" Mijo is interrupted when he finally moves the rest of the spear out from his body. "—bear! I might be a hero, but I WANNA LIVE!!!" Mijo stands up and tries to run, tripping when his feet couldn't find ground anymore.

_Scene 6_
"Rhida.." Mijo and Rhida sit close together by a campfire as the night settles down, each in their dark world magical forms. "We're getting physically farther away, but.. should we also be getting separated.. emotionally?" asked Mijo, as Rhida sighs and huddles closer. "I.. need you to stay.." Rhida trails off as she struggled to say anything before saying, "Life doesn't want us together," she starts sobbing. "She keeps moving us to different class sections, different friends, different worlds.. a—and, I..." Rhida cries into his chest. "..I don't want our last years spent in pain.. but whenever you're not here I.. feel sad, it's growing ever bigger.. and.. if we can't will through it.."

*"What will we be after?"*

_Scene 7_

**"I don't care about your petty tricks and delusions to conquer the world."** Mijo says to a swordswoman facing him off. "This world means nothing to me. I only care about my friends' safety. And if I have to destroy everything to kill you," Mijo glares. **"I will."**

*"Edge of Sacrifice: Annihilate."*

The world around Mijo is destroyed in a rush of fire and lightning, turning every single building into rubble and everything into a barren wasteland with a permanent red sky. The swordswoman was almost actually killed before her doctor appeared and shielded them enough to use her portal to leave, but at a great cost to both. They won't be seen for a while afterwards.

_Scene 8_

"Approximately 255 thousand people were alive in Nuevo Leon back then. I got.. some data after you left. There were.. around fifty five thousand people  in the initial blast radius, but.. due to the elemental energy coming out was.. abyssal in its nature, you.." Jomi's breath hitches, looking scared but also regretful. "you.. killed around one hundred thousand of them. Some were lost cause due to abyssal corruption from Cara. The rest that survived was split among the worlds that we summoned to take in the refugees. Nuevo Leon was.. inhabitable. Tainted by intense hatred."

**"And, have you told anyone else?"**

"I didn't.. say that you.. specifically, but I couldn't hide that it was a cause of your fighting. I blamed it on Cara and her allies." Jomi curls up. "J—just.. don't do that, again. Please." The princess, who started becoming more fearless when she was freed, was genuinely scared of Mijo. "I don't know. Don't forgive me. But, I.. want you to keep this a secret." Mijo was shaking and trying to control his breath. "Many people already know I was there to witness that, running to the portal back here, I saw the dead and the dying. Do not let me fall further by giving away my only sense of normalcy. ***I.. massacred them...***" Mijo went close to Jomi, who was tearing up and shaking saying this as she profusely nodded before he pulled back and tried to get his act together.

_Scene 9_

"ARLEN!!!!" Mijo unsheathes 'Lightbringer', and splits through time and space to find him, casually growing more abyss clots and spawns. "Oh, the light—" Mijo heads on fights him, as Arlen reflects and parries Mijo's blade.

"Haha.. you're the light? How corrupted you are, you seem to even be more, than that princess." Arlen commented as he and Mijo locked blades. "Tch, if there's one thing I'm always good at?" Mijo moved back, sheathing his blade then floating as he summoned 'Mirage Lance of Сохранение'. "ELIMINATING ENEMIES LIKE YOU."

"THE BURNING SUN — RAIN UPON YE!"

Arlen chuckled as he used the abyss monsters to swarm Mijo to distract him to teleport out of there. "Go ahead, use every single power of yours to destroy Nuevo Leon, hm?" taunted Arlen, making a portal.

"ABSOLUTE POWER."

Mijo threw the mirage lance before unsheathing 'Lightbringer' to cut a way through the swarm then summoning his 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' katana for the final and last attack. "SURPASS, BEYOND THE ABYSS." Mijo's signature moving through space and time to get a cut on Arlen's left shoulder before he managed to escape as Mijo immediately moved to get his lance then sword to finish off the rest of the abyss monster stragglers.

Mijo is at a breaking point. The surroundings are barren, whatever ruins was there had crumbled.

"Can't.. die here, haha.." Mijo unsummoned his blades, before forcing himself to run back.

_Scene 10_

"Rhida." said Mijo as Rhida was about to leave. "I hope we meet again, on better days." Rhida put her hands to her chest. "Will we?" asked Rhida, still not looking at him and her back turned away from him. "We.. will." Mijo approaches her as she turned around and faced him. "Rhida. We.. are separated kilometres apart. You are pursuing your dreams out there." Mijo smiles shakily. "Go, please. I.. I'm fine. I'll.. stay here. I can.. I can survive. I'll wait again, like always." Rhida tears up before hugging him. "I see it in your eyes.. You, don't have to lie." Mijo was speechless as he hugged her tighter.

Urda approached the duo. "Mijo." Mijo and Rhida reluctantly pulled back. "I know." Mijo nods as he waves goodbye to Rhida. "Let's.. I.." Urda interrupts, "Go on. Just, say what you feel. Jeez, why am I the one encouraging you now?" Mijo chuckled before looking at Rhida longingly. "Goodbye, under the.. starry skies, where.. I go to. If.. you come back, meet me again, and.. maybe tell me more about Saint Lucile~?" blurted out Mijo, as Rhida smiled and nodded as shes waved goodbye to the two. "I will. I trust you, so don't die before I get back, okay? Heh, Urda.." Urda gasped and tilted her head. "Hah?" Rhida stepped back to near her portal. "He's all yours." Rhida stepped into the portal and it closed before Urda could fully say, "Hey! W—we talked about—ah... she's gone. Dammit, why did she have to.." 

Mijo put his arms around her. "Come on, let's go back to Honrato High, after talking to Jomi. We have a lot more to do." Urda slightly blushes but its more warm, fuzzy and controllable now. "Don't get why I'm still like this, but hey.. if this is how it's going to be, so be it.. I got some games I wanna talk about, y'want?" said Urda, as they slowly walked to Jomi's Castle Indoors. "Sure."

_PRESENT!_

"It's been a few months since then.. I can't get the feeling off that I missed something while drifting through days like a shadow..." Mijo sighs as he briefly glances at Urda with her other friends. She notices him, smiles with a face mask on, waves as he waves back before she goes back talking with them. "Do I like this..? Why would I want to ruin their lives for my sake? My feelings. I can change them, but.. they.." Mijo smirked. "Heh. ..are their own."

<p id="VS7"><md-block># DeltaRambles: Valentine's Dilemma</md-block></p>

---

_Honrato High, 11:56. February 13._

Mijo is leaning on some railings near the stairs of the _blue building_ that had two stories and on top, to the third room from his direction, was his classroom. He was wearing glasses, his hair was a shoddy attempt at a slick back, with white streaks all over, the white shirt and black joggers combo of generic civilian clothing, and white-black mix of a nice pair of shoes.

"Should I leave..?"

Mijo is thinking very hard. It's the Day before Valentine's so, he needed some sort of reason to stay over, but everything points to not staying.

"Firstly, I have three schoolworks I gotta do later on my laptop... at home. I can't write here as well when outside, or.. disturbed by anyone, really. Then thirdly, the two people I stay here for are.. absent. Ikari is at some scouting event, Lauvielle is at a hangout with Cassie.. and Urda, I saw her leave with her bag so..."

Mijo trails off, going silent as he nervously checks the students, teachers and other people talk and interact, almost like he's waiting for something, or someone..?

"Rhida.. we'll meet tomorrow, at the dark world. But, even I think that she's busy today so, even if I really wanted to.." Mijo thinks to the dark world portal, then the portal in it that leads straight to Rhida's dorm at Saint Lucile University (as a Senior High Schooler!!). "She's busy. We've been chatting, she seems to be anxious about some research that her professors are after again." Mijo reiterates to himself, checking the messages to confirm before putting his phone in his pocket and sighing.

"It's ridiculous. Why even have a day for love if I'm still.. alone in it. Not, alone _romantically—_" Mijo emphasized with sarcasm. "No, like.. who the **fuck** am I supposed to share this day with? My family? The people who are there regardless of what happens, even if you _really_ don't want them there and ends up worsening your—" Mijo stops himself. "Besides. I meet them everyday. Who cares? This day's _special,_ so meet someone special.." Mijo chuckled darkly. "They say."

Mijo was silent again, mostly because he was getting tired of still remaining in the sun's rays, getting hotter by the second. Just the uncomfortable back and forth of wind flowing to make it cold enough to not move, but not enough to stay chill and the sun's laser. Finally he spoke up, "Give money." Mijo leaned forward, moved to his backpack, and looked at Lauvielle's bag. "She's not coming back soon, right?" mused Mijo, as he then grabbed his pseudo-handheld videogame device, known to us as 'Tetris on the People's Handheld' that.. also featured other games, 99 in fact. Developed by Jomi after Mijo asked her to modify his knock-off tetris toy handheld into a real colored old handheld portable videogame player.

"..why did it feel like someone explained this device's history?" thought Mijo, as he felt the narration for a brief moment before he stepped back from his bag and went back to his original spot. "Anyway, that was close. I need to wait for the teachers to go away so I can covertly insert a bill into her bag." mumbled Mijo, as he contemplated why he just talked the idea into the world. "..why? One, she's not interested, otherwise a long time ago she'd have confessed or something, during either school or the multiple dark world adventures after either the third or fourth cataclysm.."

"Two, if so, why is she more in-line with maintaining friends, then? If this friendship principle aligns, means that I'm not **just** the _'one and only'_—" He says with mockery. "I'm one of many, many friends. That's fine, if so.. why do I care?" Mijo paused before talking about, "Three, does it matter? Last time I did this, no one talked to me about it, because it was meant to be.. secret. No one knew. So then, all this talking is.."

**_"..meant for me."_**

"I'd come up with a hundreed excuses and stories if I have to, the point is.. this is for my own feelings. If I leave without doing anything for my.. so-called 'friend', I'd feel bad even though she'd feel _juust_ fine. So, this.." Mijo was going through his bag, finding his wallet and picking out 50₱. "..this is for me." Mijo looked around as he shoved the bill into his pocket and waited until people were distracted talking to each other, when people weren't looking at his direction before making the move.

He got to his bag, hovered over Lauvielle's bag, and inserted a 50₱ bill into her slightly open zipper as he fully closed it. Then he breathed a huge sigh of relief before picking up his bags and leaving with a burden on his mind lifted.

---

_Flashback! February 11. Dark World, Dajovy City, Underground._

"..Done." said Mijo, as he sheathed his katana again. "Always love helping you guys~" Lauvielle says to Lyka with some of Bonfire's fighters beside him. "Haha yeah! Can't believe the heroes are taking care of chores around here.." commented Lyka as Lauvielle nodded. "Duh! What? Think we always save the world?? Besides, we're still growing and learning, maybe we'll find something new or not.. eh." responded Lauvielle as Lyka shook her right hand with his own robotic right hand in agreement. "Of course! We'll take it from here!"

_The two leave.._

"Where's Ikari?" asked Mijo, as Lauvielle shrugged before answering, "Probably fucking around with her girlfriend or something." Mijo imagined what'd that look like...

`"Hey look what I can do~" Ikari showed off by firing at static targets quickly, but she missed one. "Ah, you missed one there.." said Charisu, before grinning. "Lemme help." Charisu summoned her pyro assault rifle and fired on the last target. "Hey!" Ikari pouted. "We take turns, okay?" Charisu chuckled as she slung the rifle on her shoulders, commenting, "Couldn't help it."`

"Why?" asked Lauvielle as Mijo snapped back to reality and answered, "I dunno. I'm just.. wondering what's going on with my friends is all." Mijo looked down, neutrally as he internally wondered why he couldn't feel anything. "Hey, look the train's finally here." said Lauvielle as they stopped at the subway station to the surface. "Man, can't believe they have trains here before us.. It's ridiculous, honestly. With the amount of money our parents give, can't they spend like a few, building a new Cab City Railway?"

"Where would they build it?" spoke up Mijo, as the two rode on with a few people as people also dropped off. "I honestly don't know... I'm not the girl for that! Like.. I guess it's not needed in the city itself, but.. ughhh! I spoke to Jomi about it, she says we need city planning but like, you get it right?!" continued Lauvielle as Mijo nodded. "This city is constantly rebuilding due to catacylsms per school year, yes. They also have magic. We don't.. well—with much much less strain—have magic in the light world."

"..Sometimes I forget you and Jomi are basically the same." Lauvielle and Mijo finally arrive at the surface as they get out. "Ah.. it's.. more complicated than that..." told off Mijo, as Lauvielle shrugged. "Right, but from what I know, she's an OC turned real. So, basically you." Mijo rolled his eyes and replied, "Well, what'd you say if you met your OC's?" Lauvielle pondered, "Well.. I'd say it depends if they know and stuff, hey! You know the feeling! Besides, I have way too many OCs, from different medias too! Like a mother with too many children, I won't know what to do. Like, yeah.. I guess I'd be happy to see them but would prefer if they didn't know I am the all-knowing authorial GOD controlling their lives.."

_The two arrive at Jomi's Castle.._

"Sir Mijo." The silver guards greeted as Mijo saluted them and Lauvielle nodded as they headed inside the courtyard.

"Hey, what do you think of Dajovy these peaceful times?" asked Lauvielle, as they were heading to the 'Dark Pearl' lounge area. "Boring.  But comfy I guess." said Mijo, as Lauvielle nodded. "I guess..? I'd agree too! But, there's so many people, like, if I told you the amount of people inspired by you or Sasha, you'd have to give me a lotta centavos. But if it were one peso coins, maybe.. around fifty, from what I remember. But I swear, there's a lot more! I just can't remember.."

"I know. They're living in this.. world that is both advanced and backwards at the same time." Mijo pauses to see Lauvielle's curious reaction. "We know what an advanced dark world civilization looks like. Manecony. This city has barely reclaimed most of it's premises. The eternal winter is still going.." Mijo sighs. "Though, I guess it's receding slightly.. Still, the weather here is.. snowing, or slightly cold. They're comparable to.. hmm, they have guns, there's a slow start to an internet, steam and industry is slowly starting as well..." Lauvielle spoke up, "Ooh! I learnt this from the castle library!" as they pass the castle library.

"They're like.. third-world countries in our world, right? We are on the cusp of tech.. ten years ago, and so, like.. Dajovy, and Kultima have tech that's somewhat catched up.. But the problem is.. um.. hmm.." Lauvielle thought as they sat back down. "..no mass production." answered Mijo, as he waves his right hand. "Not the only problem, but.. from what I've seen, there's simply less materials to go around, and in general, abyssal monsters interrupt daily life a lot.. Jomi is pretty much sustaining this city from collapse. She's a powerful abyssal magic user that can glean knowledge from me... This is why I go here a lot, a lot is spent just rediscovering and reverse-engineering tech. She's the only one who can understand my light world terms, and translate them to the dark world."

Lauvielle says, "Didn't you say like.. um, last time, during the showdown party—" Mijo interrupts, "That's still a stupid name by the way—" Lauvielle looked at him deeply to get his attention. "—that you had many other familiars.. Including that Ascilla girl? Why Jomi?" Mijo thinks before saying, "The only one who is obligated to. She is rare. My others.." Mijo thinks to Ascilla, with her umbrella and camellia flowers traveling across dark worlds casually and Cara, currently dating her abyssal doctor and having fun in Dajovy instead of helping Jomi due to her infamous reputation as the worst abyssal queen.

".. desire freedom more than to save the world." Mijo shrugged. "Besides, they're too powerful to be affected.. meaningfully." Mijo looks at Lauvielle. "They only help when their goals align with us. Such as beating up Arlen and keeping dark fountains from flooding the light worlds too much.." Lauvielle adds, "I always wondered why Ascilla made herself to be a villain only to tell you that.. Like, I'd still.. well, I still hate her for letting Laire beat us up then beating us up herself.. but she just.. well, she just moved on, I guess?"

"She cares about me only." said Mijo, as he goes and pours RoyalCo orange-flavored soft drink to his cup. "You only found out because you and Ikari pestered about my camellia outfit she put on me in that world." Mijo put his hand on his chin, his stubble touching his hand. "I knew what she was trying to do, but I wasn't in the mood for it." Lauvielle asked, "What was it for?" Mijo shook his head. "Not.. the time. You wouldn't.. forget about it."

`"..you.. wouldn't get it. No one will.. Being someone as confused about my appearance and identity as me, you... you wouldn't get it."`

"Hey?" Lauvielle's face turned serious. "We're best friends, Mijo! Tell me—!" Lauvielle's face turned concerned, she adjusts her glasses before continuing, "You don't have to, but.. I tell you about my problems, so.. if you have some you wanna say, I'm fine with it.. I wanna know more about you, hero~"

Mijo nods. "Yeah yeah.. Just, it was nothing." Mijo thinks before saying, "It's between me and Ascilla, she put a binding vow or something—" Lauvielle widened her eyes and her mouth opened, "Huh?! Like, that exists??"

`"..no. But I made a promise, to myself. I shouldn't burden you. My problems are for me to solve. I just want you to be happy, by my side."`

"..nah. It's something she made up." Mijo laughs. "It works because we're familiars. So, no. You can't binding vow our math teacher to be a better person." Lauvielle groans. "I swear, I'll check with Jomi if you're lying.." Lauvielle and Mijo sit beside each other, silent as Mijo stared blankly before standing up. "I have to go.  I have to meet with Jomi."

"Ah! Right! Well, see ya tomorrow~" Lauvielle waved goodbye as Mijo nodded and waved back before leaving the lounge.

_Jomi's Office. February 11, 19:00._

"That's about it for overtime work, haha.." joked Jomi, as she closed her notebook of knowledge. "A shame you can't pay yourself more, huh?" replied Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Hehe, well.. I already live in a castle, have staff, Ana and Sasha take care of a lot of daily work.. All I have to do is protect, preserve and advance Kultima, and Dajovy." reiterated Jomi, as she slumps over her chair. "Big task. But you're a princess I guess. Makes sense." Mijo comments as he goes over and smokes a dark world cigarette.

"Hey, just because it's a healthy version doesn't mean you can't be addicted to it!" exclaimed Jomi, as Mijo hums in agreement. "You don't care about underage smoking?" asked Mijo, as Jomi hesitates as she replied, "I—well I can't stop you, anyway! Besides, I'm just concerned for your health."  Mijo nodded as he further smoked.

"Hey, so.. Valentine's is coming and.." asked Jomi, as Mijo glances her way. "..have you thought of what to give to Rhida?" Mijo looks down, smoking before grabbing the ashtray nearby and tapping his cigarette at the rim. "I dunno. I have been thinking it since the start of the week." Mijo brings the cigarette to his mouth.  "Maybe money. I don't know what she wants. I'll just ask if she wants anything when I meet her this Saturday." Mijo then smokes.

"I see." Jomi says as she lays her head on the table. "What do you think she'll do for *you?"* asked Jomi, as Mijo lays his cigarette near the ashtray answering, "Dunno. I can't imagine that." Jomi gasps and is speechless as she sighs, and grabs a cup pours RoyalCo on her cup. "Brutally **fucking** honest..." Jomi drinks. "You could've at least.. I dunno, imagine? Creatively think of what surprises your.. love—I dunno anymore—might give you." Mijo smokes. "Who—ah, fuck you." Jomi chuckled. "You were about to say it. So, either both of you don't care and I'm asking why the fuck are you still in a relationship, or one of you is drifting.. Could be both, honestly.. I.. can't tell anymore. You two keep flip-flopping your feelings whenever the topic is brought up." Mijo groans.

"Ah, you could've gotten the stronger relaxant y'know? If.. that's why you're.. y—yeah." continued Jomi, as Mijo nodded as he crushed the cigarete into the ashray. "Mm. That's why. I don't care though. Besides, not in the mood." Jomi brings the wine cup and herself closer to Mijo, leaning forward. "Answer the question~" Mijo groans again, swatting her away, as she smirked and sat down. "What question?" asked Mijo, as Jomi laughs and drank more. "You know. You and Rhida, sitting in a tree, k—eh.. you already did.. um.. fucking?" Mijo stands up, pouting.

"Ugh, disgusting." Mijo stares at Jomi, smiling before he sat down, sighing. "That sounds hard to do anyway. But fine. I know what you're thinking." Mijo sighs. "I just.. think she's going to worry more about what she wants to do for me than her grades or new friends.. Really, all I want is to be with her, talk maybe. She's living somewhere far, and.. well, it was my turn to explore around on her new home so.. maybe she'll treat me to something, but.. I don't expect that. We.. both disappoint each other, but.. we still remain. We don't wanna let go." Mijo gets some red wine and pours it into his cup.

"Wha—hey! That's mine! You're also underage drinking now... come on..!" Jomi pours more RoyalCo to hers. "It.. is the essence. We'd want to remain like this, just.. a bit more. Just a bit more. Maybe.. we can meet again closer to our homes. But, hehe.." Mijo drinks his wine. ".. that's not this day~! I have college to deal with! Ahh.. Hey, maybe things will go crazy once I.. move out and.. have to get new companions again?" Mijo keeps pouring and drinking his wine. "Leaving.. all of them behind, forgetting why.. I was.. friends with them." Mijo continues drinking before setting down the cup and looking very much red and drunk, slumping over on the table.

"Ahh.. you're uh.. trying to not feel huh?" asked Jomi, as she looked at the books surrounding them. "I.. guess that's to be expected. I'm just.. I just.. Hey, I'm confident you'll have a good Valentine's alright? Just, be who you are." Mijo looks at her, tipsy. "Whaat.. does that even mean..?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi shrugged. "Forgetting that you're in a magical place, you have me, and the other familiars. It takes a lot of will to.. make new beings that.. are you in different expressions." Jomi muses. "Just, be honest. Seriously. No one will get you if you don't try~"

"But that requires acting on something.. I just... I don't wanna face the questions, I just wanna live.. why.. why doesn't anybody let me?" mumbled Mijo, dazed and slowly drifting into sleep. "I'm not saying you should dump everything like what you did before. Telling someone of your problems doesn't mean they'll take it how you expect it." Jomi scratched her head. "Bad or good.. You really don't know. Put yourself in their issues, y'know.. empathy?" asked Jomi as Mijo groaned. "I've learnt I've become so different.. that, I've disconnected with people.. I.. I wanna change.." Mijo closes his eyes. "..that." He falls asleep.

"Ridiculous." Jomi sighs as she stands up. "I'm not your girlfriend or your mother, ugh.." Jomi cleans up. "But to be fair, you'd do this for anyone and unfortunately, I am you.." Jomi chuckled. "Kidding. I have no ill will towards that pain point we have nowadays.. I've accepted it. Let's just.. sleep, I guess. Gooosh.. I have work tomorrow, y'know? That's why I can't drink vices~" Jomi sighs while smiling before fully finishing cleaning up and carrying Mijo to his bedroom. "Hope he remembers to go back to the light world tomorrow.." mumbled Jomi, as she ponders on her schedule and life.

_Rhida's dorm. February 14, 14:00._

"..."

"I'm here." said Mijo, as he waits and sits on her bed. "H—hold on, I'm changing.." replied Rhida, before audibly shuffling around outside then entering her own bedroom. She was wearing a black sleeveless undershirt, grey wool jacket covering it, denim jeans and black heels. Her brown hair is let down, she was wearing a lanyard that had her school I.D., then her'R' with an 'M' being bonded to it by a small heart chain keychain he gave her that one time, last Valentine's. Mijo was wearing a branded 'Chainsaw Man' white t-shirt beneath a black cotton jacket, hood up, and another pair of black joggers. His rubber shoes were a different pattern of white and black, his white-streaked hair hidden by a yellow bucket hat, that is yes, covered by the hood too.

"Oh. Mijo.. did you forget to..?" asked Rhida, before Mijo realized and went through the sling bag beside him and found the lanyard of his I.D. that also contained many keychains. The pink dream-catcher and steel 'J' from Ikari, and pink heart & snowflake from Rhida. "No.. it's.. a consequence of travelling through the dark world. Sorry 'bout that." Mijo grabbed his bad, slung it over himself and stood up. "Let's go." exclaimed Mijo, offering a small smile. "Ah, right." Rhida grabbed her purse and was neutral but nodded and held his hand as they exited her bedroom.

_Fónti City, February 14, 14:30._

The two were eating ice cream as they sat at the somewhat cold weather of the city's park benches. "Rhida..." called out Mijo, as Rhida turned to him, as she was staring off. "..Should we have uh.. purchased ice cream here? Eh.. I admit, it's not that cold, at least.. compared to Dajovy but.." Mijo starts biting into the tasty cone. "..I dunno. Uh.. there's like.. a bunch of stalls, and stores n' stuff." Rhida is silent before also biting into the cone. "I don't know this place that well.." Rhida looks around. "There's the supermarket.. university.. um, I guess there are street food I get dragged into often. I.. don't know how to get there myself, hehe.." Rhida is silent before looking at Mijo. "Ice cream became my comfort food when I got here and settled.. I.. don't know why."

The two were silent, as Mijo hums as he hesitates, clenching his hands into fists before relaxing as he moved closer and wrapped his right arm on her left arm, trying to feel her hand as Rhida blushed slightly and gasped. "Mijo..?" Rhida was looking at her left, warming up slightly. "Just.. I.. stay close, please?" Mijo grips tightly as he ate his ice cream. "I—eh.." Rhida was slightly tearing up but she looked away, eating her ice cream. "R—Rhida?" called out Mijo, as Rhida gasped and looked down. "Sh—Shut up.. just.. shut up.." Rhida went through her purse and dried her tears using her handkerchief, also reciprocating by also gripping tight.

The two silently finished their ice crrams and looked through their phones before Mijo put down his phone as Rhida leaned forward. "Uhh.. um.. let's go." Rhida grabbed his hand and picked both of them up. "I wanna walk.. um, and talk, I guess. No phones! I saw you doomscroll.. it's.. I.. um.. let's just.. okay! Lets's just lighten our.. thing, I guess." Mijo nods. "Sure, just.. know where we're going. I go here like.. once a month."

_Fónti City, February 14, 15:30._

The two were eating 'Kwek-Kwek' and Siomai Balls stuck through sticks as they walked across the city.

"I guess there's gotta be these foods everywhere. I don't know why I didn't expect it." commented Mijo as he ate one. "Me and my friends go here once in a while, in a nice day maybe." Rhida ate one, before continuing. "It's.. delicious." Mijo nods. "Well, par for the course.." Mijo eats another one as they continue walking. "How's.. university life?" asked Mijo, as Rhida ate another and was thinking a lot before answering, "It's.. the same as before, but also not.."

"I'm not in college you know. Just the Senior High section. So, it's.. the same.. routine, but.. in a new place." Rhida brushed her hair unconsciously. "You'd know once you go away to a college." Mijo sighed. "Yeah. I.. don't wanna know until I'm there." Rhida stilled, making Mijo stop walking as she asked, "Well.. I told you what I feel about being in a new place.. and it's going to be different moving out for college than it is for two more years of high school.. So, I.. just want to ask if you'd consider.. the future for a moment.. and yeah, uh.. what.. what would you feel?"

Mijo looked at her eyes, with his narrowed eyes before he looked away and continued walking. ".. it's hard for me." Mijo says as he looks around. "I know where I'm going.. I guess. I never blind myself to not planning ahead. But, it's in the future, so I just.. prepare my entry there and let my current feelings dictate." Mijo then elaborates, "My feelings tell me to savour the present moment, my logic tells me to keep moving forward... I don't know why they conflict."

Rhida eats another one as she replies, "I.. guess I was forced to confront this much much earlier.. and.. honestly?" Rhida smiled faintly and darkly. "I felt scared.. lonely.. but.. I couldn't oppose my parents. They wanted the best education for me after all, and Honrato just.. didn't give me enough apparently." Rhida grabs Mijo's left hand. "I.. had to adapt though. My parents took care of the process. I went through it. And.. I got here." Rhida holds him tightly. "Um.. I dunno, I just survived..? I met new people, had fun.. I.. guess it's.. been good.. probably better but.." Rhida looks at Mijo almost imperceptibly before continuing, "..I lost my old friends, you.. I.. that.. still.. hurts, but like.. like what everyone says, I.. have to move on.. a—and.." Rhida eats the last one, throws away the stick and hugs Mijo, stopping the both of them. "..it sucks..!!" said Rhida, on Mijo's shoulder, muffled. Mijo just hugs her back. As she cries while other people move around them.

`"..In a supposed day of the celebration of love, we're.. both depressed and crying when we see each other? Is.. is that.. is this what love feels like?"` thought Mijo, as tears fell without his conscious knowledge.

"But.. at least we have the dark world, right?" asked Rhida as she slightly pulled back while remaining pretty close. "..yeah. We can meet each other physically through it. I.. thought I lost you forever.. it consumed me.. but.. seeing you, and you right now.." answered Mijo, as his left hand rested on her right cheek lazily swiping. "..I see my meaning." Mijo tears up more. "So, don't cry.. Let's enjoy our time. If.. the world dares to separate us.. I will.. I won't let it. We'll.. meet again, won't we?" elaborated Mijo, as Rhida smiled and hugged him tighter as they silently did so on the cold afternoon of Fónti City.

After a while, they pulled back. "How.. long can you stay here? By my side I mean.." asked Rhida, as Mijo answered, "As long as this day. I.. might have to leave tomorrow, when you fall asleep. I.. also have to do some.. important messages to make sure the alibi makes sense." Mijo pondered. "The protection of the dark world towards its discovery only happens inside. But, for now..? Let's continue." Rhida nodded happily. "I—I'll help you too. I'll make sure no one.. umm.. suspects anything. I'll just say you're visiting from some other town... it'll work out!" Mijo nods as they continue walking, "Then.. let's get going."

_Cab City, Rika's House, February 14, 19:32_

"Hey!" Rika was playing a gacha turn based role playing game with Mizo. "What? Jealous I got Yaoguang?" asked Mizo, smugly smirking. "YES? Hello?? You got her like.. way too fucking early. Didn't you say you won the 50/50 for Aglaea in the previous banner??" questioned Rika, as Mizo proudly nodded. "Yeah, I'm that lucky. Unlike you bozo, I have all the meta teams!" Rika growled. "This. is. ridiculous! I barely won the pull for Sunday, and now, Evernight reruns and I haven't got her! Like, fifty pulls in! I swear.. if I lose this I'm going to—"

Mizo received a message. "Hol' on. Someone messaged me for some reason." Rika tilted her head. "Huh?" Mizo picked up his phone as Rika watched. 

Mijo (cool mysterious guy idk): So, I need a bit of a favor to ask. See, I'm.. meeting my GF somewhere.. far away, and I said to my parents that I went to sleepover at Rika's house for.. the weekend.. And well, since you're _closer_ to her, uhh.. can you inform her that I did that? Thanks~

"Oh, this is for you." Mizo showed the message to Rika who already saw it. "I—hey! Come on, Mijo.. I have strict pa—if.. ask him if his parents call my parents or just me..?" asked Rika, as Mizo messages that and Rika didn't look as she thought about it seriously before Mizo answered, "Mijo says his parents don't really care but you should care to mention it to prevent suspicions from anyone else." Rika groans. "Where is the guy anyway? Mizo messages Mijo about it before answering, "He says just somewhere far away and that it's secret because his GF worries it might leak?"

"Ah..? Are you that untrustworthy Mizo?!" asked Rika as Mizo shook his head amusedly. "Well, no. I suspect he just has an interest, like me, in keeping his privacy. I'd keep your location hidden too if it wasn't known already~" Rika groans but is smiling. "Uhuh.. Anyway, sure whatever. You two lookalike anyway. Except that he is somewhat more zesty and has basically stage 3 white hair syndrome, haha.." Rika shrugged. "Don't know how he bagged the shy journalist girl but.. hey, whaddya know these days.." 

Mizo nodded as he closed his phone. "So, wanna play more HSR?" asked Mizo, as Rika nodded. "Hell yeah! Play on my account though. You don't deserve the jades there!" Mijo chuckled as he opened the game on her computer.

"GO! I'll FIGHT ALONE!"

_February 27, 2026, Dark World, Honrato High Copy. 11:30_

Mijo is wearing a blue undershirt that's covered by a long sleeve orange jacket, with the sleeves being covered in chainsaw imagery. His glasses have turned into orange goggles that are strapped on his head, emitting orange-red flames that enhance his perception and stamina. His pants have darkened from already dark blue and his rubber shoes are burning red while the shoes themselves have turned white and black due to concentration of flame and electricity. He is wielding two chainsaw-like weapons that are held with an extended handlebar.

"Mijo?! Are you crazy?! Even if you're some stupidly powerful being, you still tire out!" critiqued Ikari, as she held her Lavastriker Flame Rifle tightly. "Yeah! What about your health?! A—and, the celebration? You ordered chicken and rice.." Lauvielle added, her book floating nearby as she pointed her wooded staff at him. "I'll get them later! I already paid, it doesn't matter. This world's in danger, and I'm the only one who can stop it. Problem is, you'll get caught in the blast, so leave! Go to the light world!" Mijo turns back to the school gate that is closed, holding back all the monsters appearing.

"Ascilla.."

Ascilla appeared with her umbrella. "Hm? I know I know, but.. you sure?" as the other two looked at them worryingly. "Hey?! Who's.. Hey! Are you friends with this bitch?!" asked Ikari, as Mijo answers, "Yes." Ikari and Lauvielle both fire flaming rock and a focused water blast, respectively at the same time before Ascilla stopped them with her umbrella before she approached them. "Dearies, I only care about Mijo, so.." Ascilla's red eyes with flower-like design glowed. "_Manipulatio Memoriae._"

_"You will forget about this conversation, as well as my appearance here. Instead, you will remember you safely getting out of the dark world, and Mijo going home early. You'll remember Mijo actually going back to the dark world once he utters your name once more."_

"And while I'm here.." Ascilla gestures Mijo to give his katana as he asks, "You can make portals, why me?" Ascilla answered, "My portals are.. noticeable. If you do it, they'll assume you led them out. This is how the memory manipulation works." Mijo nodded, as he unequipped one of his chainsaws to open a portal. "Are they.. fine?" asks Mijo, while looking at a blank expressionless Ikari and Lauvielle. "Mhm~ It's just they're still under my spell, it'll.. go away once I know you're done." Mijo cuts open a portal and pushes them through before closing it and sheathing his blade as he summons his chainsaw back.

"Good, now.." Ascilla looks at the gate. "Good luck~ May you make it in time for the concert..!" Ascilla disappears as Mijo sighs heavily. "There's apparently a concert, I almost forgot about that.." Mijo thinks, "I said to Rhida to bring a disguise and come with me to the Honrato event." Mijo then breaks open the gate with his chainsaws. "So, I. won't. let. you all win!!!" Mijo cuts through the first few.

The scene looks like a bloodbath, with Mijo, having increased stamina and determination, cuts through the abyssal monsters like paper. It is.. in the essence of senseless violence. Mijo swiftly adjusts to certain monsters breaking the chainsaws by summoning his mirage lances of Сохранение. He strikes and blocks enemies using the multiple lanes he kept summoning. He runs through a gaggle of enemies and burns them. Then he turned around just as a monster was about to stab him and stabbed it with a mirage lance before spinning to cut and saw through the monsters surrounding him.

_This went on for hours.. constant and seeming endless.._

_13:40, Inverted Honrato High._

"I'LL KILL YOU ALL!!!!!" Mijo's chainsaws have become dulled from attacking but he still persists. The lances protect him but he's beginning to lose his patience. "FUUCCCKKKKK!!!!" Mijo jumps to the tallest building, onto the 4th floor roof. "Y'all are really **_hard to fucking exterminate, huh?!"_** Mijo throws his chainsaws to the monsters below, cutting through a lot before they are stabbed to the ground as the monsters swarm the position. Mijo sees the destroyed buildings, roofs and trees from the constant fighting and loses all pretense of containing the damage. "Fuck this..! DAWNMAKER?" Mijo summons his greatsword with moon and sun motifs. 

**_"Dawnmaker: Falling Supernova._**

Mijo raises his blade to the sky as a large collection of heat, flame and electricity gathered up above. "YOU WON'T SURVIVE NOW." Mijo continually collecting even as monsters swarm his very position as lances prevent that from becoming dangerous. "Watashi wa tomodachi o mamoru to chikatta.." Mijo grinned smugly. "But now? I just wanna destroy everything. The rage, jealousy, and sadness I felt.." Mijo's power above him gained a silver of black and purple swirling around it. "What about if I bury it here? Surely, surely.."

**_"Won't this permanently destroy this entire dark world?"_**

"Heh. The portal for this is the Von Meyer Section Room. This is going to screw them. In fact?" Mijo brings the sun closer. "I danced here. With _her._ This.. is a little ironic, but.." One of Mijo's blue eyes turns red, like Ascilla. 

**_"Won't this be interesting? I can't wait to see what the Abyss Order does. When March 23 comes.. _** Mijo brings the sun down fully. **_"..I'll be there, and ready to die again and again and again!"_** The sun destroys everything as Mijo's eyes adjust to the blinding light, seeing the stone, steel and plant life all dissipate within the sun as it explodes outwardly, destroying everything around the school as he laughs manically, happy for once. As the dust settled, and the barren land of what once was the inverted Honrato High fully came into view, Mijo floated down.

"Had your fill?" asked Ascilla as Mijo nodded. "Good to know where you got that attitude from." said Mijo before summoning 'Denkitekijiyū Noken', his katana. "Haha, I get it." responded Ascilla as Mijo cut the portal back to the light world. "Getting that massive power, some _might_ say this is.. a bit worrying, coming from the hero, no?" commented Ascilla as Mijo nodded. "Who cares? You'll lie to me, right?" asked Mijo, as Ascilla gladly nodded. "Good, then this is between us." Mijo walks to leave. "Ah—ah—ah." Ascilla taps his shoulder with her umbrella. "Anyone that comes across this however.."

_"Let them."_ Mijo side-eyed Ascilla. "Arlen, Sasha, Cara.. whoever." Mijo brings up his sheathed katana. "Let them. Target me? We'll see who is cleansed by the light at the end." Mijo enters the portal fully. "Ah, good to see you back again, Mijo.. Fair warning.." Ascilla teleports in front of him. "Just how long will you keep this up?" Mijo answered, "I'll keep moving forward..." 

**_"...Until all my enemies are destroyed."_**

"Bold, bold. We'll see." Ascilla nodded before letting Mijo go.

---

_13:50. Light World, Honrato High Gymnasium_

"Mijo.. um, what took you so long?" asked Rhida, as they walked while the event played nearby, sounds of singing and guitar ringing out. "..Cleansing Operations. Normal stuff." Mijo looked eerily distant, even more so than usual. "Mijo.." Rhida looks away. "I saw you. You were wearing a new outfit.. The Chainsaw Outfit, based on the sleeves.. but, it looked bloodied before you switched.." Rhida smiles. "I know my boyfriend's strong enough against weak monsters, so.. you must have fought many.. and, I wanna know."

Mijo is silent as he looks at the band about to play, who includes Sean, a classmate, knows the dark world but had to pull out after the monsters were pushed to the Inverted Honrato High. "It's.. a test. I'm unused to how the blades work. I forced myself to the front to baptism-by-fire myself but.. it included a lot of near misses and mistakes I had to use my lance for." Mijo smiled faintly. "Don't worry about it. I.. I think the threat is gone now."

"Oh? Man, then I wish I was there!" exclaimed Rhida excitedly as Mijo nodded, as he clenched his fists before relaxing. "Hah, yeah. You weren't though. And you shouldn't. It's an Honrato High issue, it's a miracle Jomi's portal to your dorm still works." Rhida nodded. "Yeah.."

_02:00. Light World, Honrato Gymnasium, A Band is currently playing.._

🎵"Hindi na ba mamayapa~"🎵

"..Mijo? Um, Mijo?" asked Rhida, as Mijo looked at Rhida. "You're.. Are you listening to them because of the song or.." Rhida points to Kurona playing the guitar, as Sean sings. ".. because they're your classmates?" Mijo opens his phone and takes a look at his phone. Photos of Sean and the 'After School Hours' band singing and playing open as he taps on the 'Gallery' app. "Classmates. I don't listen to Filipino songs."

"Really? Like, never at all?" asked Rhida as Mijo shook his head. "No." Rhida checks her own phone. "W—well, I have recommendations, but.. I'm not sure if you like soft, slower love songs..?" Mijo looks away. "I.. I don't." Rhida sighs disappointingly. "Fine.. I.. I have my Spotify.. if you want to check it out.." Mijo looks back at Rhida, who looks back at him confused before he looks at the stage. "I try to. It just doesn't hit me the same." Rhida replies, "W—what do you mean?"

**_"I listen to them every night, to try and.. maybe get to share them with you. I.. I.. do it every. single. day."_**

Rhida gasped. "M—Mijo? I.. is that.. well, did you enjoy it?" Mijo looks down, eyes wide and bloodshot before shaking his head to ground himself. "..best I can." Rhida asks again, "What.. what did that best look like though..? I.." Rhida taps his shoulder. "I don't.. You don't have to, Mijo! Please. Couples can enjoy different music too.. right?" Rhida looks worried and a bit irritated. "I.."

Mijo's left hand holds her right. "..I did." Rhida's mouth slightly opened. "I did. Way too _fucking_ much I cried because every second reminds me of you and—" Mijo's hands are shaking, he's visibly tearing up but he's **still** trying to stop himself. "—and, I just.. can't listen. Not that I had.. any emotions tied to any specific songs, they're annoying to listen to everyday if popular but.. me?" Mijo tries to look away as Rhida puts her other hand on his face. "..I chose it. My choice. No one forced me to force myself to cry over this.. I do, and I keep returning to it everyday, I.. I just—"

Mijo is hugged by Rhida unexpectedly as the music surrounding them climaxes, yet the two are focused on each other.

"I.. I know. I know how it feels.." Rhida whispered to his ear, also slightly tearing up. "It's okay.. I didn't mean to pry like that.." said Rhida as Mijo responded, "..Did I want to? Probably not.. But.." Mijo hugged her tighly. "I.. needed to."

---

_17:00. Honrato High, SB (Blue) Building, Von Meyer Classroom_

"..we met a lot of your old buddies, including Mack.." said Mijo, as Rhida nodded while they sat in the armchairs. "Well, this... was mostly to keep the.. less knowledgeable unaware. I didn't really wanna attract any more attention.. besides, don't I look cool?" asked Rhida, as she gestured downwards, her orange shirt hidden by a white jacket, denim jeans, and orange heels. "I only told you to look somewhat orange because people would question if I didn't but.. didn't know you had so many..? At your dorm too?"

Rhida shrugged. "Yeah haha... I have like, candy colored shirts for home wear. Come on, a girl's gotta look fashionable~" Mijo nodded, holding the black bucket hat he's currently wearing, along with the white chainsaw themed shirt, black pants and white-black rubber shoes he brought to school. "Just.. curious." Mijo leaned in close, a bit smug, "Maybe.. jealous?" Rhida grinned. "Hey, don't say that.. I think you have the most outfit variation in the dark world, actually. Maybe that doesn't translate well because.."

Mijo waves his hand away. "I'm a man? Yeah, get that a lot." Rhida raised her eyebrow, "You do?" Mijo looks at Rhida. "What I mean is I get black pants plus white shirt a lot, even outside school. Don't have anything else to wear because.." Mijo stood up and looked down on Rhida. "..I'm quite built different." Rhida fluttered her eyes as she saw Mijo stand tall, towering over her. "..hey, no need to emphasize my stature! And, I know that, like.. do tall people just not get good clothes??"

"I'm also a man." Mijo rolls his eyes as he sits down. "My mom decides my clothes. Probably 'cause I'd wear band or anime merch whenever I get the chance to." commented Mijo, as Rhida nodded. "Right, like right now~? Heh, but.. um, so.. how's school life, anyway?" asked Rhida, as Mijo thought about it before answering, "Fine, I guess. Without the dark world. I'm sure you know of the Vesalius Showdown, right?" Rhida nods. "Yeah, talked about in the GC. Are you.. fine?"

Mijo hesitates to answer before saying, "Better than what I could've been." Rhida is silent before asking, "..elaborate?" Mijo sighs, as he hears a random band playing on stage back at the Gymnasium. "I'm.. wondering how to say this. You know, because you've not met her.." Rhida raised an eyebrow. "Who?" Mijo mentions, "Ascilla.. You.. hmm. If I described her, would you know..?" Rhida shrugged. "I.. is she a lightner or darkner?"

"Definitely a darkner. But, she's this girl with flowers, umbrella..." elaborated Mijo, as Rhida blushed when she remembers.. stuff about Ascilla. "..Um! Do.. Does she happen to also have white hair and red eyes?" asked Rhida, as Mijo sighs amusedly before answering, "Yes." Rhida's right hand moved to her lips before saying, "She.. kissed me." Mijo's lips open. "I—It wasn't! I.. I.. You know her, right?!" blurted out Rhida.

"It's fine." said Mijo as Rhida stopped herself. "I'm over it. Besides," Mijo looks at Rhida's eyes. "It's something tangentially related anyway." Rhida nods slowly. "Right, and why?" Mijo muses, "I'm.. happy again. But, it's probably not healthy why.." Rhida tilts her head. "Me?" Mijo looks at Rhida. "I—Well, besides you,  I find myself revelling in destruction more and more commonly." Mijo looks at his hands. "I dunno. I.. I want to feel like this isn't going to hurt anyone but.." Mijo looks at Rhida. "It.. just might."

Rhida sighs as she listens to the stage nearby, about 'After School Hours' band winning or something. "I.. trust you." Rhida looks at Mijo seriously. "If anything happens, there's Jomi..." Rhida brushes her hair. "You.. you know why you shouldn't. Nuevo Leon.." The two went silent before Rhida continued, "..yeah. I don't want you to be sad, but.." Rhida stands up and looks at him. "..I don't want you to destroy everything and everyone. If you.. are there, in the precipice of a cliff of utter immorality.." Rhida leans closer, her eyes narrowed. "I'll pull you to me and we'll both ascend back."

The two were silent before Rhida tripped and landed on his lap, the two blushing before she pulled back. "Sorry!! I swear—I didn't mean to ruin the moment.." blurted out Rhida, as Mijo stands up. "I.. thanks, Rhida." responded Mijo, smiling as Rhida was mouth agape before nodding. ".. Okay." as she also smiled faintly, the embarrassment slowly fading.
