<!--FEB 29 SPINOFF FUN SHORT LORE BREAK-->
<p id="CS1"><md-block># DeltaRambles: An Everyday Dark</md-block></p>

Author's Note: Takes place after Season 1, I am not sure whether it's canon or not since I am still developing it but that's why it's here, as a fun spinoff for a day. Take any names / plot points here as consideration but not concrete. Anyways, enjoy and see you when I see you!

Summary: A example of the daily life of Mijo, a student from Honrato Pez and a proficient dark swordmaster.

*ALARM RINGING*

"Ughhh, its... time." said Mijo as he slowly turns off the alarm, and rests for a minute.

"Nak, Time to eat na!" said May, his mother, calling him for breakfast.

"Coming!" said Mijo before he grabs his phone, turns off his night light then went out of his shared room.

"So anak, we have the usual and.. PE today or no?" said May, as she cooks over in the kitchen.

"PE!" said Mijo, as he eats hotdog and eggs, watching some video on his phone.

After eating, he decides to shower and grabs his towel from outside and goes to the bathroom. He cleans, and bathes himself then turns the shower off as he grabs his towel and heads to his shared room in which he alone, dressed with his PE Uniform, then he goes to the living room to wear his shoes. Then he grabs his I.D., facemask and sling bag, before going out of his home to see his father on their motorized tricycle.

"O nak, you have everything? Your assignment, your phone, your money?" said June, his father.

"Yes, yeah. Let's go!" said Mijo, as he went inside the tricycle and they drove to school.

He sees the landscape of Cab City, his hometown, one of the more populated ones in fact. They drove until his father dropped him off near the school, due to the traffic. They both said goodbye to each other and then Mijo went inside the school. As he walked to his class upstairs at the 2nd floor, he sees Urda with Reeb talking, he sees Rhida and Mack walking around, he sees Lauvielle and Leviente arguing and then he sees JR and Dombat talking about something as he goes inside the room, that is now a dark world, as he sees Ikari, practicing firing in his left.

"Where's the school decoy? I thought Jomi had just finished remaking it..?" questioned Mijo as he talks to Ikari.

"Weellll, there's a reason why they're outside. It's not done yet for some reason, go ask her." said Ikari, before perfectly headshotting 5 dummies.

"Uh, ok..?" said Mijo before he walked off to Jomi's Castle in which he found Jomi modifying some floating room next to the inside of her castle.

"So, how's progress? You know that this staying open depends on you right?" said Mijo, as he looks to the room.

"Yep, and.." said Jomi, before she finished the room and then she says, "that's why it's done! It just took a bit more time than what I wanted. Come on, go out. You'll see ou— my brilliance in programming!" said Jomi, as she looks at Mijo.

"Ok, I'll bring Ikari with me, then how would I know if it worked?" questioned Mijo, as he peers deeper into the room, seeing the teacher's table, the arranged chairs and the whiteboard as same as it is in the light.

"Just go in again, then you'll see the room! A note though, if you want to explore outside, you'll have to get me and go outside of any door." said Jomi, now smiling a bit.

"*Smirk* Ok, i'll go, then.." said Mijo, before he left the castle walls and brought Ikari with him to the light world.

"Huh? It's done, Mijo? Whew, because it's almost time!" exclaimed JR, as he stood near the door with the other 9-Lit.

"Yeah, you all can go in now, don't forget that everything there is simulating the real thing so good luck!" said Mijo, as his classmates go in, he sees the brilliant seemless transition from the door, the windows to the one in the dark world.

"Hey, let's go in already, look!" said Ikari, as she pointed to Mam Mely Sant, their adviser.

As they entered they saw that, through the day without a hitch, Jomi's creation worked as the teachers didn't notice a single thing.

"Wow, this works, I didn't think it would.." whispered Mijo to Ikari, looking happy.

"Yeah i know right, anyways we gotta do this activity so..." said Ikari before returning to their previous topic.

As the days past, even many non 9-Lit were surprised such as Urda, Rhida, and even Leviente. After a lot of 'boring' school, class was dismissed.

"Finally, whew.. and we have to do this for next week too?! Ugh, it's honestly ridiculous on how we have so many worlds outside of that door and we have to wait at least until next next week before we can do anything in school hours.." ranted Mijo to Ikari, as she checked her phone.

"Even data works here, I'm guessing because it's more enclosed than the average dark world? Oh well, it's time to go home anyway and.. hey have Jomi told you if we can go out of here?" said Ikari back, as she looked at Mijo.

"Oh yes actually, it's just this pink notebook, as long as it is outside with me, anyone can go out of the room and into the true dark world." said Mijo as JR and Lauvielle join in.

"Wait so it's like a key or something?" questioned Lauvielle, as they see Mijo bring out the pink notebook.

"Hmm, hey Mijo, what if we are outside the room then somebody enters, will they be put in the room or outside?" speculated JR, as they now think a bit more.

"Uh, I know.. I can see the look in your faces, it's not perfect, but it can work. As for your question, they go wherever the pink notebook is." explained Mijo, as he looked at the group, then at JR.

"Ok, so it's basically like an anchor, fine." said JR, now waiting for Mijo.

"Ok, do y'all want to explore Jomi's town?" questioned Mijo, as he went near the door.

"Yes! That's where my training gear is!" said Ikari, with an affirmative look.

"That is also where I keep my multitude of staffs and other books, y'know for adventure?" said JR, with a stern look.

"Yeah, i wanna talk to some of the people there! I wanna catch up with Shley and Brna! See how they're doing!" said Lauvielle excitedly.

"Ok, it is decided, come on guys!" said Mijo as the group went outside with the pink notebook teleporting to the outside.

And so everybody went outside, having fun.

Mijo - currently fighting some monsters in a training ground built by him and Jomi after CS1, to make it more interesting he often switches weapons.

Jomi - managing the town, occasionally greets the others.

JR - at Jomi's library, reading some books for new spells and occasionally goes to the training ground and tries out new spells.

Ikari - at the shooting range, near the training ground. Practicing her aim and talking to Lauvielle on a temporary phone that Jomi made to offset communication loss.

Lauvielle - walking around Jomi's town, talking and meeting with the people there as she has Ikari on her temporary phone.


*Rewind to MAPEH Practice #?? Alt #??*

"Eh, where can we practice?! We probably can't use the school and all the locations are expensive, what can we use that first, doesn't cost much, and without interference from the school?" questioned JR, as the class discussed places to meet up and practice.

"Hmm, Luzca is a fine place, that's where I live nearby.. It is the least expensive, but it's not cheap." said Laha, an old friend of Mijo from elementary now here.

"Wait! Guys, uh.. JR, can we discuss some 'ark' privately?" questioned Dombat, looking at JR intently.

"Huh— Oh, uh sure." responded JR, understanding the hidden codeword.

So they went to where Mijo and Ikari were chilling and talked.

"So, 'di ba Mijo can make, like awesome dark worlds, so what if we make that our practice ground? Like, after december, almost lahat naman knows what's up with the dark world, so if we use it, we have more space! Now we just have to ask Mijo and _especially_ Jomi on the technical details." said Dombat, as Mijo also listened in.

"Hmm, you are right, but where should this be? As Mijo explained during the previous grade, it has to be made from a place here. So we still have to have an anchor from the light to the dark." responded JR, now getting the attention of Ikari who was half-asleep earlier.

"For it to be Jomi's Castle, we probably need it to be in our classroom." said Mijo, now joining in the convo.

"But, the reason we're talking about it is that we can't be in school, and besides that, we don't even have a way of.. the internet!" explained JR, with a concerned expression.

"I.. have a way. Tell them to go to my house. I have an idea, make a dark world in a student's house and go there, my house might be small but the endless dark isn't." said Mijo, going for a bold plan.

"Whaat?! Mijo, that might just work! I mean, from what I understand at least." said Ikari, also now here.

"Hmm, are you sure? Your house, it's an entirely new world." said JR, now neutral, thinking about the possibilities.

"I... uh have been there. I'll contact.. hmm, actually. I can do it by myself just fine." said Mijo, as he thinks about the previous time he was there.

"Ok, we trust you on this, JR, let's go." said Dombat as she and JR went back with the other group.

*Rewind to Jomi's Castle, one saturday afternoon..*

Mijo is practicing with a claymore, killing a bunch of dummy monsters before Jomi comes and greets Mijo.

"Hi Mijo! I see you.. have something on your mind?" questioned Jomi, as she sees Mijo break the claymore accidentally, then pick up another one.

"Uh... No point in hiding no? Well _yes..._" answered Mijo, now stopping and looking at Jomi.

"Mhm, yep. So, what is it? Honestly, you should probably talk to someone, *other* than me. Because.. you get it now.." said Jomi, now spawning some monsters.

"Ugh, well.. this. one. is for. my own reflection." said Mijo, as he swiftly defeats the monsters with his claymore.

"Ok, so what is it? Tell me, like every saturday this happens.." said Jomi, as she summons more harder monsters.

"Hmmph, well it's just this practice. It's been buggin' me ever since we started to prepare and practice for the MAPEH Demo." explained Mijo, as he struggled against the monsters.

"This? Are you referring to the MAPEH or this whole dark world thing?" questioned Jomi, as she helped Mijo with some monsters with her katana.

"Hmm, I come here willingly, a part of my exercise routine, you don't just get a whole world to not go to it, right? But, MAPEH has been eating away at my life, as it uses every free time I have in school, practicing. You don't see it because it's contained within the fake classroom, but it's there." explained Mijo, as he now defeats the monsters, and sits down.

"I guess you feel tired, but why come here? You could just be watching videos but instead you're practicing, like what you despise in MAPEH?" questioned Jomi as she also sits down.

"Huh, that's what's been troubling me, how can I have completely different attitudes for different practices even though the end goal is somewhat the same and I also like dancing, so why would I hate it?" said Mijo, as he picks up a halberd and summons monsters himself.

"Hmm, could it be that you hate having no choice? I know us, given the choice, you would not dance, even though you like it. But you also hate getting corrected, right?" said Jomi, as she watches Mijo practice his polearm techniques.

"Huh, I.. agree. I just wished that the mandatory dance thing didn't have to happen, Mijo, you know how? Like how quizzes are now domains? " questioned Mijo to Jomi.

"Hmm now that depends on your classmates honestly, you will still not be performing, but your grades will be fine." said Jomi, now looking closely at Mijo's halberd.

"Ugh, is it bad that I am asking for some dark abyss stuff to start happening? Or anything that I don't have to convince them to do, like anything of the students night but without all of the saving the world burden?" said Mijo, now picking up a bow and using it to spawn the monsters.

"This is a world with magic, but it has rules y'know? You could start it yourself but after the previous grade, no one dares to provoke you, me or even some of the former M8-Clam members.." said Jomi, as she unsheathes and looks at her sword.

"M8-Clam? Hah, a good name for its time.. I just.. need.. I honestly don't know, I've been looking for a good adventure but I've also been reminded of my past so I'm conflicted there too!" said Mijo, as he starts practicing with the bow, missing some shots.

"Let's get back to the point, have you thought about enjoying the process? Remember your *own* quote? 'No lows, no highs'?" questioned Jomi, as she stood back up and summoned more monsters.

"Yes, i do. I.. know that is true, and I ask for more, so yes, it's a contradiction. Honestly, sure. As long as I master my swordsmanship and keep practicing, I should be good. After all, I lost weight, and became a proficient fighter, so I am much better than my previous self, so I should continue to be positive, and yet acknowledge problems when they come up. Ok, I am clear about this, thanks Jomi." said Mijo, as he picked up his sword and picked the hardest monster.

"Always welcome, well I am guessing you're good so, see ya'! I got important government matters to deal with.." said Jomi, as she left the training ground, leaving Mijo behind.

"Bye! Now onto you, shadow of Jomi!" shouted Mijo, as he fights a clone of Jomi that they made after their fight at the start of the previous grading.

"Hehe, *You shall.. die!* " said Mijo, as he does his signature Freedom Cut and slashes through the world, breaking glasses appear as the clone suddenly gets a lot of cuts and is weakened.

"Now, let's end this!" shouted Mijo as he finished the clone, resulting in it disappearing and him feeling tired.

"Now, I am the one with power!" said Mijo, as Jomi returns with some stamina foods.

"Figured might as well drop by and give some, oh and I heard you say that, that's a DMC reference— jeez actually your entire kit is a DMC reference." said Jomi as she drops off some stamina foods.

"Hey! It's a good game, there's a reason why I am good at this thing ok?" said Mijo, as Jomi laughed and left.

"Ugh, well I am feeling tired, might as well eat." said Mijo as he sits down and eats.

*End of Memory Fragment*

"Huh, this is what you want recorded in the archives? Sure.. then." said Jomi as she put the fragment into the Delta Archives.

"Yep, don't worry Jomi, this is just a test, I always wanted to see this." said Mijo as he inspected the Fragment.

"Mhm, ok." said Jomi, as she updated the archives.

*The end.*

Author's Note: YES! After starting and ending a chapter this fast, this makes me want to just finish all of them in one go! Hehe, just joking. Anyways, so that's it, I just wanted to imagine how Mijo goes about his everyday life but then it turned into a backstory about how that would work and how school still exists.. So that's it, thanks for reading this special spinoff and see you soon!

<!--C1 JOURNEY / RECAP OF JOMI, THE PRINCESS OF THE DARK, ALSO, I SHOULD PROBABLY MOVE THIS BUT IDK TODO: hopefully-->

## Summary: 

Jomi's life before the fated meeting between her and the lightners is a dark past she doesn't want to remember, but she is haunted by herself throughout her time with the lightners.

## Author's Note:

A heart-wrenching story when my life is also at its peak of stress and panic. This is a good way to let out my inner self while also developing a favorite character (Jomi). Anyways, if I need more edits and other quirks, it'll be here, enjoy! (I.. uh.. because.. well, duh, it features my problems so..) I'll let you decide on that, though.

Edit 1: Experimental in writing style i think

Edit 2: has.. sexual stuff, skip if don't want

————————————————————————————

Jomi is leaning at a nearby wall as she looks at the former place of the dark fountain, lost in thought. "Those two.. are my only hope..." whispered Jomi to herself, looking somber under her coat, witch hat, and hair.

Suddenly, her abyss magic flared up and it started to hurt her, due to the instability and corruption she was keeping to herself. She moved away from the fountain room to go to the throne room, wincing and grimacing from the pain as she does so.

"Ugh... This is not good.." murmured Jomi, as she walked slowly due to the immense pain. "But, how do I follow them? This.. place, it's gone. I can't even stay here much longer. Well, I can but.." continued Jomi, before the pain got worse, losing control over her abyss magic as she yelped in pain.

Jomi's pants ripped at the knee, as her black coat tightened around her. This made her fall down, but she quickly got up and freed herself off her coat. This was another use of abyss magic to prevent it from damaging her more, but it was temporary, she knew she had to get out before something bad happened to her.

"Ok.. I need to.. get out now, unless I want her to—" 

Jomi is interrupted by a familiar face that she doesn't want to remember. "Jomi~ Stop resisting me, my dear princess. Soon enough, my plan of ascending to be the queen of the _abyss_ will succeed. You'll see that you've been pursuing a goal that is not fit for you, nor can you escape it." said Cara, being a side of Jomi that she wanted to get rid of, manifesting in the world with Jomi's abyss magic.

"What.. do you mean? What goal, exactly..? I am just.. curious." asked Jomi, as she turned to face Cara, her face a bit wary. "The Lightner's Goal, of balancing the magic between the light and dark. You know this, but.. your.. circumstances require you to.. fake pursuing this goal, to trap and corrupt the lightners. But, it seems that, you have started to believe your own lies, are you even helping them? If this, is the case?" Cara responded, her hands behind her back, approaching Jomi step-by-step.

Jomi's thoughts are swirling with doubt and guilt. She felt uneasy just looking at Cara, she looked worried as she questioned herself. Is she really in control, or is she following a plan not of her own will? She had to know, she couldn't sit there and be filled with negative thoughts, as that only exacerbated her corruption using abyss magic.

"I.. don't know what to say.. But, what can I do about it? You're always here, you're the side of my power, my strength.. D—do I follow you until the end? Then, what is the point in keeping me here? I could've just killed the two, or corrupted them here, I don't get it.." Jomi looks as Cara slowly closes the distance with a smile that only sends shivers down her spine.

"Well.. I am not.. _that_ strong yet. Of course, feats like this—" Cara gestured around them. "—are possible with my— our.. current power, but.. for now, we must keep deceiving the lightners. That includes keeping _you_ around." Cara touches Jomi's cheek as she smiles menacingly.

"O—ok.. I get it.. Fine. I'll.. keep doing this. But, I have one last question, what.. world do you want me to go to next.. my.. queen?" said Jomi to Cara, filled with hesitance and worry as Cara answers, "The Scians-Chemastra Kingdom. You know how to get there, and you know what to do. Don't forget, you have to go at a specific time. That's.. all I have for now, see you.. soon." Cara disappears as Jomi is left there, her chest heaving as she looks at the place where Cara was, filled with fear and anxiety.

Jomi is tempted by her dark abyss magic, as her thoughts are filled with fear and despair. "I.. shouldn't exist. I was.. created by her to.. to.. deceive them, as.. much as I was tortured and brutalized.. I am still here, I am kept alive by.. their will.. But, why..? I just.. want to be free.. To not bear the responsibilities and weight of the abyss plans, and just.. live.." Jomi summons a sword and points it to her chest. "But.. even if I do this, it won't do anything.. In fact, things will get worse. So, I have to keep going, keep putting up this.. persona of mine. It's unfortunate, that.. I was placed here, what would've happened if.. me and Mijo.. nevermind. I don't want anyone to be in my position, no matter how adventurous they may be, the cost.." Jomi's sword grazes her body, as she points it away. "is not worth the pain."

Jomi puts her sword away, making it disappear with her abyssal magic, as she looks around one final time in the crumbling world of the skeletons, as she teleports away to her castle home. The world she called home, she had nowhere else to go anyway. She went to her room in the castle, a queen-sized bedroom with bits of books and potions she had been writing and making, respectively. She sat on her bed, feeling super tired, her abyssal magic remaining, but now more subdued.

"I.. should go to bed. Tomorrow's.. another day.. She would want me to be as prepared as possible." Jomi takes off her glasses and switches to the only other clothes she ever had, her pajamas. She only had two sets anyway, at least when she was created. She looked at her bed, feeling dread for the next day, but she was too tired to resist the bed, so she went to sleep. Her dreams were just more repeats of her old life, so more nightmares that she slept through because she was used to the pain, though that did not stop her quiet sobs throughout the night.

Jomi wakes up as Cara is sitting nearby, with a small grin surprising Jomi. "Ah!?? C—Cara? Why are you here..?" 

"Jomi, it's nothing specific.. I just wanted to.. have fun with you for a bit." Cara says before she stood up and used the abyss magic that connected them to make Jomi very aroused.

"What..? Hey.. Please..? Stop..? I.. don't want to.. It's imperative that I remain.. with energy on the mission, please? At least afterwards.." begged Jomi, as Cara approached her with devious intentions.

"Haha, well.. I am not.. doing anything more than this, It's your choice if you want to fulfill it." responded Cara, as she remained very close, staring down Jomi's eyes.

"I.. please I beg of you, queen.. Please, as.. much, as you want, I have to focus on this mission, otherwise.. your own plans.. remember?" continued Jomi, as Cara reconsidered her options.

"Hmm.. how about a lil' snap?" Cara snaps her fingers as the abyss magic makes Jomi instantly climax, as she is shocked and her body in shambles. "There. I think that's enough. Get ready, dear." Cara disappears, leaving Jomi panting as she looks at her bottom, then at her bedsheets, wet.

Jomi sighs, "Why.. is she always.. like this..?" before she got up and went to the bathroom, getting a towel and showering before returning to clean her bedsheets. After that, she grabs one of the potions and drinks them, as the luxury of food for her remains a dream as she lives off her abyssal magic. She dresses in her battle witch attire and picks up her glasses, as she summons her sword to check its durability before heading out of her room, looking at the empty castle ground.

Jomi looks out to the emptiness around her, the barren halls of the castle, she was always alone and she never had anyone there except the other two lightners that had visited once and quickly left after she corrupted skeletons forcing her to use abyss magic more, defeating them but causing her dark and rash thoughts.

Jomi sighs, "I should go. It's time." as she feels a sense of light in her veins, she knows this means that the lightners are jumping back in, so she teleports to the kingdom of Scians-Chemastra, then she sees the lightners at the chess rooms, knowing the path they're going to take she decided to try and move around the kingdom, but suddenly she got captured by one of the _Queen's Guards,_ she doesn't attempt to resist and instead hopes that this is what her master would've wanted.

Jomi is brought to the queen for questioning, "You can't hide from me, dark princess. You were about to help the lightners, weren't you?" questioned Shley, the queen of the Scians-Chemastra Kingdom, she already knew this through her own master so they already are acquainted. "Hey. Yeah, I am here to help them. So?" Jomi puts on a confident attitude, she had great experience with this due to the persona she puts on already and her internal master dark side's will.

"Hm? Why so, Jomi? Any particular reason, o' dark princess?" asked Shley again, this time with a bottle of acid pointed at her as a threat. "So.. basic. It's to balance the magic of light and dark, by cooperating with these lightners we can coexist with them in our world." Jomi is genuine, but her tone makes Shley suspicious.

"I see.. Well, I see no good reason for you to remain here. Obviously, as a queen to a fellow queen, there's a.. conflict of interest, and I am not taking any chances with you and the lightners cooperating. I'll have to see for myself, how good these lightners are." Shley looked at one of her guards. "Send Jomi, the Queen of the Abyss to the dungeon!" ordered Shley, as the guard took Jomi, as she was very confused and scared as she tried to maintain her outward confidence.

She is thrown to the farthest prison cell from the door, as the guard locks the cell and leaves. "I—Is this what.. you wanted.. Cara?" 

Cara appeared, "Well.. not exactly, but this'll still be useful. Great performance there by the way, you managed to fool Shley into thinking you're actually helping the lightners, or.. is it genuine?" Cara looks at her with a smug smile.

"G—genuine? I.. uh.. don't know anymore.." Jomi looks around her, before looking at Cara. "Anyways, soon enough the lightners will arrive and they'll probably not like you, so anymore orders, my queen?" Jomi mockingly bows down to Cara.

"No, but I am glad you asked. See you afterwards, dear~" Cara then disappears, smiling while waving goodbye.

Jomi looks at her prison cell, it seems to be well-maintained, with a bed, table and even a bathroom, she wondered if this was for royals as she had never seen a prison like it. But since she was alone and biding her time, she decided to sleep until the lightners arrived, formulating a backstory.

_**Fast Forward to After the Lightners Left**_

"Wow.. you're more friendly with them than I thought. Jomi, I thought you were the Dark Princess and the Abyss Queen?" asked Shley, as Jomi was once again, looking at the former place of the dark fountain. "It's.. part of it." said Jomi cryptically, as she turned to face Shley, making a friendly smile. "Anyways, what do you think of them?"

"They're fine.. They have good motives, by that I mean they just want to have an adventure and have a definitive goal, and it seems to go home, enjoying the journey." analyzed Shley, as Jomi walked with her back to the throne room. "I agree." Jomi responds, not knowing what else to say.

"So, I have a question, what's with the hood? You look amazing without it, and it's not for being anonymous, I personally think you're the most popular darkner. So, anywhere you go, you're bound to be recognized, whether through your abyssal magic, or even your multiple appearances."

"Well.. It's.. only a matter of time, I guess.. I'll take off the hood now then, Shley." Jomi takes off her hood, revealing her form to Shley. "I admit. I was surprised when I saw Mijo, you look just like him, except you're the girl version." 

"You're the first one to admit that to me. But from those lightners' looks, they also realized it." Jomi says as she looks around the throne room. "I can see why, but anyways, are you actually going to stay here and go watch me governing or..?" Shley asks as she switches to her more casual and work look. "I am a queen of the people, so I gotta go check my queen's guards, make sure the lightners didn't do a lot of damage.."

"Wait. I need to show you something." said Jomi, unsure of herself. "Oh? What is it?" asked Shley, curious but confused. Jomi turned her back to Cara. After that, the abyss magic of Jomi slowly manifested Cara, her clothes are the same with the only exception that Cara is always royally dressed. "Hello, Shley. We have met before."

"Two Jomi's? Interesting. Go on." said Shley as Cara quickly used the abyss magic to spawn chains at Shley's hands, making her gasp. "W—What are you doing?!" questioned Shley, as Cara slowly approached Shley. "I might have softened up, but.. that doesn't mean I've become rusty either."

"O—oh.. Your magic.. it's potent.." Shley's mind is hazy, she's a bit disoriented at Cara's actions. "Always had been. Anyways, this is just to remind you that I am still in control, my dear." Cara then took the chains off and disappeared while waving goodbye.

Jomi fell to her knees as the abyss magic returned to her, as she let out small gasps of pain. "Jomi..?" Shley walked to Jomi's side. "Are you good? You definitely showed me.. But I have a question why didn't you just.. use your abyss magic without summoning another form?"

"Oh? Right.. I guess I should also tell you this.." Jomi stands up and looks at Shley, with some worry. "I have two forms, normal.. like currently.. and—" Cara spawns near them as the other two are a bit surprised. "Cara! Cara form."

"Cara form..? So, should I call you—" Shley points to Jomi. "Jomi and you—" Shley points to Cara. "Cara?" The other two nodded. "Ah, ok. So, what else..? Can I go now?" Shley asks with a bit of vigilance and chill.

"Hmm, let's see.." Jomi walks to the fountain room, as Shley follows behind. Then Jomi uses her abyssal magic to make a portal door, it looks to be about a bit taller than average, and it's a wooden one.

"Here. I have connected our worlds. That's it, as the.. dark world princess and the abyss queen, I have a lot of work to do.. See you, Shley. I am set on Dajovy." said Jomi, and before she was about to go into the door, Shley stopped her. "Dajovy, huh? What will happen to my world? Since, it's.. not relevant anymore.. to your plans?"

"I.. have.. further uses for this world, don't worry." answers Jomi, as she was repressing abyss magic flowing out of her. "Ok.. I just wanted to know that you had some empathy." Shley says seemingly satisfied, as Jomi further tries to keep her abyss magic inside. Jomi can barely answer, "O—ok.." as she weakly smiled before going into the door and locking it.

Cara appeared and told Jomi, "You lied. You don't even know my future plans, but you lied.. Anything to keep up your appearance? I am not opposed to it, but.. I think she would've accepted either way." as they head to Jomi's bedroom.

"I.. That's.. yes.. you're right.. I just.. had to not make her worry about it. You know.. but.. so.. are you actually going to leave her world behind?" asked Jomi, very concerned as Cara chuckled and responded, "Hmm.. You don't need to know that yet, dear. But, for your next mission. Dajovy, it's a.. more interesting world than the last one, I'll be taking a more.. direct role."

"D—direct? What about the goodwill you made me build with the lightners?" asked Jomi, before Cara made Jomi's clothes tighten around her, making her very uncomfortable. "What..? What.. reason..?" Jomi is shaking and is trying to free herself to no avail.

"Oh, _your_ goodwill won't disappear, of course. But—" Cara makes Jomi very aroused again, as they arrive at her bedroom and Cara closes it. "P—please.. make it quick.." Jomi closes her eyes. "But.. I will reveal myself to the lightners, by doing so.. Phase 2 will begin.."

"Y—you have plan phases?!" exclaimed Jomi, as Cara nodded and caressed Jomi's cheek. "I did say before the lightners arrived that I won't be entirely honest.. Of course, your reaction is just.. immaculate, if I say so myself."

"So.. what's phase 2? If you don't mind me asking..?" Jomi says as she opened her eyes, and saw Cara very close to her face. "It's.. none that you would find out with the lightners, don't worry.. I've made sure that your deeds remain useful." Cara says before she kisses Jomi, she dominates Jomi there for a while until she pulls back. "O—ok.." Jomi responds, resigned as she closes her eyes again.

For the rest of the night, Cara used Jomi in many different ways to torture, arouse and humiliate her in very different ways using the abyssal magic they shared that she controlled. At first, she decided to tease Jomi for a while, touching Jomi in many private areas, meanwhile Jomi felt violated so many times, but all she could do was let Cara do it, unless she wanted to be punished more by Cara. Cara, after making Jomi climax, and made her super drained from everything, she followed up with intense pain as Jomi was numb to the whole thing after she basically lived with it since creation, and so she succumbed to everything that she's feeling and was a body for Cara to use. After 5 blurry hours, Cara had her fun and left, leaving Jomi exhausted and barely alive, _again_.

Jomi in her dreams is disturbed by the events of the day, constantly running and fighting Cara leaving her exhausted. 

"What is this.. is this a dream..?" asked Jomi, as she stumbled around the empty city. "Where.. am I even? What.. am I doing here?" Jomi walks around some more, still finding no one. "Cara.. isn't here.. But.. I am lost.." Jomi notices and sits on one of the empty benches. "Ugh.. I still feel.. tired.. I can't stay here forever though, Cara might find me.."

Jomi sees Mijo and Urda appear, walking at the pavement. "O—oh.. It's the two.." Jomi immediately switches her persona. "Hey..! Lightners! It's me, Jomi! I just.. happen to come here, due to some battles I had to face, haha.. Don't worry about it!"

"Oh? Jomi..? Cool, we're actually here to fight someone, to save the world y'know?" responded Mijo, with a smile. "I think she's like an abyss queen or something." added Urda, looking thoughtfully.

"An abyss.. queen? Great.. great.." Jomi is trailing off, not knowing what to say. "You'll join us, right? You're the dark princess, so.. maybe you have experience or even some useful knowledge about her?" asked Mijo, as Urda nodded in agreement. "Oh..? Yeah, I do.." Jomi responded, contemplating what she should say afterwards. "Great! Let's go." Mijo drags Jomi with him and Urda to fight Cara. "H—hey!" Jomi tries to resist, but since she's all too used to being forced to do something she doesn't want to do, she lets Mijo direct her. They arrive and see Cara, with full battle gear and a sword.

"Hello, lightners.. Jomi? What a bold move, to return here." Cara corrupts Jomi, making her suffer as Mijo and Urda responded with attacks on Cara. "Stop.. please.. end me.." muttered Jomi, as Cara maintained her suffering while fighting the other two. As the two sides clashed, Jomi remained in the sidelines, unable to help or even watch as she tried to let go, but Cara kept her alive and in pain. Eventually, there was one flash of lightning and then a tornado. Soon after, Cara tapped Jomi's shoulder. "Dear, mind looking at me and your.. lightners?" Jomi couldn't do anything but look as she is even more horrified and petrified when she saw Mijo and Urda unconscious and trapped by abyss magic.

"This is the result of your good deception, even though.. you did try to break out.. you still helped me, great job..!" said Cara, as Jomi is filled with guilt and helplessness, realizing that everything she did from trying to free herself and making connections was all of Cara's master plan. "Now, don't be sad..! In fact, be happy! Because, we're going to merge again, and.. you're going to learn to **enjoy your suffering**." Cara uses abyss magic to merge with Jomi again, as Jomi is once again resigned to her fate, watching in defeat. Then before it could complete, she wakes up in a cold sweat at night.

"What was that?! Please.. leave me alone in my dreams.." Jomi starts crying, as she looks around her, taking in the room that Cara left it in. "N—no.. It's not her.. It's just me again.. Gosh.. I am still— where's my.." Jomi goes to her cabinet and picks out her pajamas, replacing her battle suit that was tightened heavily. "I am going to have to fix that later.." Jomi comments, looking at the battle suit one more time before closing the cabinet. "Oh.. did.. my tears already stain my clothes..?" said Jomi in-between sobs and sniffles as she goes to bed, and sleeps.

She wakes up with dried tears and a sense of dread for what's coming next, as she goes and gets her battle gear loosened from the previous day. She dresses with the battle gear and takes another potion of sustenance, since she can barely get food on her own due to Cara's interference. She takes a deep breath before going to Dajovy, mentally preparing herself for the new world.

Cara suddenly pops up, with a smile. "Oh, almost forgot. I didn't tell you that you'll go earlier than the lightners will arrive, you gotta prepare some stuff.. Hmm.. I believe you'll encounter _her_ soon." Cara disappears.

"Her? Again? Weird.." Jomi says before continuing to Dajovy. She arrives at Dajovy, way ahead of the lightners. "Woah.. this world's a.. cold place.. I need the—" Jomi materializes a coat modification to her battle clothes to stand against the winter. "the.. that.. um.. what's it called..?"

"The Zimnee Pal'to. Obviously." said Cara, appearing out of nowhere again. "Ah! Stop.. doing that! Please?" commented Jomi, as she put on the coat modification. "I won't. This is a.. test of your improv skills, haha." responded Cara, before she left. "Aww.. This.. *sigh* Ok, just do your job.. Jomi.." said Jomi to herself, as she walked through the snowstorm.

## Summary: 

When there's an important event to go to, especially where his friends are, Mijo tries magic but things go unexpected and he still has to go to the event.

## Author's Note: 

This _definitely_ doesn't say anything about me, it's just a fun idea turned into an actual story that I did because it would be fun to see this happen, might be canon, but you'll see.. anyways enjoy!

Edit 1: It has implicit sexual things, since I don't want to write one but it is the natural progression of things, so keep that in mind!

Edit 2: Oh god this is just the outline of c4GS1, well as I said _**might**_ be canon, I have taken some creative liberties with this one.

Edit 3: Shit, this is starting to be my main plot, i need help.

————————————————————————————

On the day before student's night, at Jomi's library, where Mijo was sifting through some books.

"Aha! I knew it! It exists!" said Mijo before Jomi surprises him.

"What exists?" said Jomi as Mijo jumps in surprise.

"Wha— You're here?! Um, no, nothing, yeah.." said Mijo as he closed the book.

"Hmm, that book is for transfiguration.. What are you thinking..?" said Jomi, as Mijo tries to return the books quietly.

"Uhh— nothing that _you_ are thinking of! Um, I'll be going to the.. training ground! Yep. Just—" said Mijo before Jomi stops him.

"Be honest, the student night is tomorrow and you are searching for magic that can modify your looks. Right?" said Jomi, as Mijo embarrassed, nodded.

"Alright, look, Don't try to hide anything from me, because.. I know you, you keep forgetting that—" said Jomi, before Mijo interrupted, "Yeah, yeah... I am not stupid, I just.. wanted to do this by myself you know? Like it's a surprise!"

"And? You can't just go to me and teach you, even though I'll make fun of you, I'll still help you, you know?" said Jomi, as Mijo took the book about transfiguration back from the bookshelf.

"Ok. But, you're always busy! Like, I just don't wanna disturb you in any of your work, like I would do in your situation." said Mijo, now finding that specific page.

"Hmm, you know too that I would help anyways, right? But, anyway... Since it's a special day tomorrow anyway here in the dark world too, I put some of the workload to my subjects. I still did my work, I am just on my break now, and went to see you." said Jomi as Mijo agrees and shows her the page.

"This, this one specifically. I wanna make a special form I can use and hide anytime." said Mijo, as Jomi carefully inspects the page.

"Transfiguration #4.1"
As with this magic, you can use transfiguration to turn yourself into anything you can imagine and design, current testing shows you can only modify yourself, and while lookalikes are possible, you cannot maintain them for long, as you have to use your own magic, and if it is far from your own look, it will also be more. An exception is for the different versions of yourself that you automatically have based on your genetics (**sex**, height, eye and hair colour; etc)...

"Oh, did you highlight the one with.. sex? Hey, hold on.. Oh no, I know what you're going to do.." said Jomi as Mijo is now awkwardly smiling.

"Yep... I also want to modify my clothing so that it can turn into a dress that I can wear, ya know for more effort?" said Mijo, as Jomi is genuinely thinking about the whole logistics.

"Uh.. sure. Let's go to my lab." said Jomi, before Mijo said, "Wait you have a lab?!" 

"Yeah. What? Where do you think I get my potions and random stuff I give? Stealing? Well, I refine stuff there.. Anyways let's go there." said Jomi, before they walked to the lab behind Jomi's desk near her throne room.

"Huh, you have a separate desk and throne? That's weird." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and they kept going to her lab.

"Welcome, to my lab! Stay here, I think I have a potion for this..." said Jomi, as she went to her potion storage to find the transfiguration potion she needed.

"Uh sure. I am just gonna look then." said Mijo, as Jomi searched through her collection. She went up, middle, down, until she found a heart-shaped potion with an eagle-shaped gem decoration that had a blend of pink and red liquid.

"Alright, here. This should do the trick." said Jomi as she gave the potion to Mijo before Mijo accidentally spilled it on himself.

"AH! SORRY! Um, what's happening to me..?!" said Mijo, as the liquid was absorbed into his body and he turned into the female version of himself, a Jomi that was wearing full gear, with a dress for some reason.

"Ooooh, interesting... Um, sorry for.. um laughing.. Hahaha.." said Jomi, as she picked up one of her notebooks and wrote down what happened to Mijo.

"Heh? Wait! I thought that I was supposed to have a way to change it, and.. this looks permanent!" said Mijo, as he now looks upon his changed body.

"Hahaha.. This is why, you don't spill these types of potions.. Anywho, I still need to fix your mistake, soo wait.." said Jomi, as Mijo silently watches Jomi pick out a notebook she had that she started silently reading.

"Hmmm, hey can you do me a favor and go to the light world with this.. form? Umm, try to improvise i guess.." said Jomi, as she flips another page.

"Uh.. um.. you sure I can act like you?" said Mijo, as Jomi looked at Mijo and smiled and nodded.

"Uh ok.. Um do I have to go into the lab again afterwards?" said Mijo, as Jomi now puts the book back down.

"No... Just, go near my desk, I still have stuff to do.. So after I make this I'll just be at my desk." said Jomi, as she picked out a container.

"Um.. Ok. I am only doing this because I am also curious ok? I am going now.." said Mijo as Jomi laughed and nodded as she grabbed a gem-based design, with a narrow mouth and wide body.

"Uh.. Ahem.. I gotta be as fast as possible, huh.. no heels.. great! I am just gonna run as fast as I can.. _Hopefully_ nobody notices." said Mijo, as he ran with a dress that didn't interfere with his legs but still slowed him down due to his new form.

"Hey! Jomi!" called JR to an unsuspecting Mijo, now a lookalike of Jomi in anything but clothes.

"Uh.. Yes?" said Mijo, trying to sound like Jomi.

"Uh, do you know where Mijo is? I wanna talk with him about something.." said JR, looking like he has a lot to say.

"Ah— Him? He.. He's probably at the library.. Check there!" said Mijo, as he awkwardly stared at JR, waiting for his response.

"Hmm, ok! He always goes there whenever he's not at the training grounds.. Anyways, see ya!" said JR, as Mijo also said, "See ya!" to JR.

"Whew, Um.. That was unexpected so I gotta go, quick before anybody notices!" said Mijo as he traveled further down to the light world connector and got transported to the light world, seeing Rhida chilling near the entrance. Mijo now looks like a schoolgirl with a tie and dress, just like how a typical female student would of Honrato Pez.

"Oh, hi— Uh, who are you? Um wait—" said Rhida, as Mijo awkwardly waves at her and says, "Oh, ah— I am.. Jomi? Yeah.."

"You're Jomi? Wait, aren't you—" said Rhida before Mijo interrupted, "Yes, I am still the pink notebook, just um.. I have the special properties of being able to have this form while outside the dark world, yeah!"

"Oooh, you haven't told me that.. Interesting, so I can bring you with me tomorrow, or even later??" said Rhida, as Mijo tries hard to get out of the conversation.

"Um.. No, I still have important stuff to do in the dark world, I just.. wanted to test something, for more details, ask Mijo about it later!" said Mijo, as he tries desperately to go back to the dark world secretly.

"Oooh! Ok I am sure it's _very_ important so I'll leave you and Mijo to do it, remember our deal!"  said Rhida, as she continued browsing through her phone.

"Ah, thanks! I'll be going now!" said Mijo, as he finally went back, thinking what deal Jomi made and how Jomi and her were on good terms, even before she went to him, and after the incident during the previous cataclysm.

"Uh.. I'll ask Jomi later, anyways, it's pretty clear what happened, I have to go, now!" said Mijo, as he ran as fast as possible to Jomi's desk.

*Meanwhile at Jomi's desk*

Jomi was humming something as she managed her government papers, as JR entered her hall with a door connecting her lab, throne room and library.

"Woah! Jomi? I thought you were outside or something and, didn't you have like.. your battle gear on? Why do you _still_ have your... mayor suit?" said JR, as Jomi stops humming and looks at JR, surprised.

"Wha— Oh. Uh, right. Um, I just switched out of them, yeah. I am just sorting some documents now." said Jomi, surprised but understanding the situation.

"Uhuh, anyways is Mijo still behind this library? I still have something to say to him." said JR, as  Jomi nodded and JR proceeded to go in the library, closing the door behind him.

Then Mijo appeared, opening the door leading to the hall, and was heavily breathing, and shouted to Jomi, "Jomi! Jomi! We *need* to go into your lab, *now!"*

"Haha, lets be quick, JR is waiting behind that door..!" said Jomi, pointing to the library door before Mijo rushed into her lab, as Jomi follows closely and closes the door.

"Aight, you sure you want your old body back? You could just forego your old identity haha.." said Jomi sarcastically as she grabbed the potion from earlier that she made.

"Yes, of course! Wh— I mean, I still need to attend school and I can't exactly register you as a student so—" answered Mijo, before Jomi suddenlt gives him the potion. "Yeah, yeah I am joking, I wouldn't wanna know how that works, anyway.." said Jomi, before Mijo drank the potion and afterwards, put it in a nearby table. "This is a temporary fix, since developing the potion that instantly changes clothes and body, et cetera.. Takes more time, so what I am doing is using your current clothes, but you change form depending on.. your glasses!"

"Wha— My glasses..? So, like.. woah!" said Mijo before he suddenly changed form to his old self, with his usual dark world clothing. "So.. If I understand correctly, my.. other form is my actual body, and this is like a disguise for now?" said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and remarked, "Yep, that means if you even separate yourself from your glasses, you'll turn to a girl! This is the price you pay for ruining my glass, now I'll actually have to steal from someone haha.."

"Don't! So, like.. How long does this.. potion take to make?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi cleans the potion and puts it back in the empty containers. "Hmm, I'll tell you when it's done, now get out, JR's waiting for you lol." answered Jomi, as she pushes Mijo out and closes the lab door. "Hey! You use lol IRL?! Bruh—" said Mijo to the lab door, as JR pats his back to get his attention.

"H—huh? Oh, hi..! I was just talking with Jomi about a book I found, what do you want..?" asked Mijo, as JR looks at him with disapproval before saying, "Uhuh.. Anyway, I have to talk to you about something.. Is she going out of that.. back room of hers?"

"Uh.. probably? Let's talk in the library then." said Mijo, just as they walked to the library and headed for a nearby seating.

"So, is there any reason why you haven't been out of the library for.. the entirety of the intramurals? Like, after that day, whenever I asked Jomi where were you, she said here, so I am simply curious.. What are you studying, maybe I can help..?" asked JR, as Mijo tries to hide his embarrassment at his words. "Oh.. yeah.. Sorry, just kinda busy, y'know.. Abyss Doctor stuff, so I have just been preparing.. I mean, I do go out, just not when you're around I guess.." answered Mijo, as he looks over at the part near the transfiguration book.

"Hmm..? Alright, yeah.. the abyss doctor.. I wonder when he'll come back... Well, that's... Hm... Sige, I'll leave you to it. Pag kailangan mo, we're here. Anyways, this new mushroom based attack, Imma see if I can do it.." said JR, as he stood up and left the library. "Good luck! *sigh* Now what.. I am basically a different person inside.. Ugh.. How does it even work..? Like, is it frozen in time or something.. or.. I don't even want to know.." mutterred Mijo to himself as he contemplated his life decisions.

"Hey! Mijo! Our daily sparring match? Did you forget?" asked Urda, as she entered the library. "O—oh! Yeah, lets go." responded Mijo, as he walked up to her and they walked to the training ground.

"Same as before, magic healthbar and no holding back, ok?" said Urda, as they prepared their weapons. "Alright, let's dance!" shouted Mijo, before they started their spar with Urda pressing a button to do so.

First, Mijo acted first slashing his way near Urda, before stunning her with his summoning slashes, as he follows it up with a slash up, so she gets knocked up, and as she is up, he quickly slashes her as he brings her down. Then he quickly teleports away, as before she could act, he managed to get a few more slashes in. Urda decides to use her gun to fire projectiles at Mijo, as he teleports and dodges all of them, as he gets the jump at Urda, quickly slashing her as Urda tries to block. Then he comes back and keeps putting pressure as she is unable to act as he keeps slashing and stabbing her. As he moves away, Urda decides to use her gun to blast in his general direction, he easily dodges and manages to keep bringing her healthbar down. Then as Urda decides to use wind to keep herself up and to block his shots, he decides to use his ultimate and break through space to deal a lot of damage. She falls down and Mijo deals a lot of damage to her as she is stunned by this amount of damage, by using his big sword and enhanced unarmed combat wear. Then as she finally has a chance to breathe, he uses his ultimate again, finishing the spar with him winning. 

"Haha.. you uh.. having a good day today.. I guess.. Whew.. And this close to student's night.." said Urda, as she sits down at the ground, exhausted. "Yeah, I guess. I don't know how I was that perfect, anyways.. What.. else..?" responded Mijo, as he also sits down, tired.

"I don't know, honestly.. Wanna get some food? Our spars just consume a lot of our energy.. so yeah." asked Urda, with a bit of hesitation. "Honestly, what time even is it.. I was so caught up with.. everything.. Just in general, abyss doctor stuff, my personal stuff, the school stuff, a lot.." said Mijo, not answering her question.

"Uh.. it's.. 2:30 PM in the light world.. What's on your mind, you can tell me... I won't judge!" said  Urda reassuringly, as she moves closer to him.
"Uh.. well, it's a secret, ok? I.. really am embarrassed about it.. I just don't wanna say _anything_ about it.." responded Mijo, as he tries to stay composed.

"Are you suuure..? I basically know most of your secrets, like Jomi.. Rhida.. you know what I mean." asked Urda, as she persistently bothers Mijo about it. " *sigh* Fiiine. Hold on, lemme stand up." said Mijo, acquiescing to her request. So he stood up, walked a few steps away from her and took off his glasses to reveal his actual form, with longer hair to the shoulder, a bigger chest area, and a more feminine body type, like Jomi's but with a bit more muscle.

"W—woah!! Are you actually Jomi?" questioned Urda, before Jomi appeared behind her, answering "Maybe..!", as she jumps up and sees the two, the only difference between them being how they style themselves. With Jomi, a more formal and royal purple look, while Mijo with his usual dark red and blue contrasting each other with a rough look.

"H—huh?! Two Jomis?!" questioned Urda, as Mijo wore his glasses again, turning him back to this 'old self'. "No.. Just a lil' magic that Mijo personally requested.. Anyways, I am going.. I just wanted to _check in..!_ " answered Jomi before she left, her steps being noticed by the other two.

"O—oh, whew.. Wait.. what magic?!" shouted Urda, before Jomi was far enough to not hear or see them. "Transformation Magic... That's what I've been busy with for a few days.. actually." answered Mijo, as Urda gasped at this answer. "No way..! So that's what you've been doing in the library! What's the reason..?" asked Urda, as Mijo comes closer to Urda.

"Just.. an experiment, that's all! I swear." said Mijo, as Urda chuckles. "Really..? Are you suure? Because I think there's a lot more to this than you say.." said Urda, teasing him again. "I am sure, alright.. one more round?" responded Mijo, standing up again.

"Haha.. Sure, but I want your girl form, deal?" said Urda, before Mijo reluctantly nodded and took off his glasses. "My glasses are for style points anyway, since getting this new form I have been able to see without it." responded Mijo, before he got his weapons ready.

"Coool, I should look into it, then." said Urda, as she started the spar, with health bars popping up.

They have a standoff as they look at each other intently for a while, before Mijo makes the first move, starting with his big slash using his big sword to slash as it gets deflected by Urda. Then he jumps high to the air and summons slashes against Urda as he does a big final slash, as he manages to get a small knock back as he lands. Suddenly Urda's blade clashed with Mijo's as he was knocked back and managed to backflip as he landed on his feet as he was knocked into the air and knocked back down with a combo from Urda. He then managed to switch to his other sword as he deflected a follow up attack and countered as he maintained his ground. Then they locked blades as they looked at each other intently before a quick deflect from Mijo due to a quick shot from Urda, pushed each other away. They both try to use their own ultimates as the two simultaneously attack each other and as it finishes, Mijo is noticeably lower in health. Urda tries to blast and maneuver Mijo as much as she can, as Mijo dodges, parries and counters her attack. Then Mijo attacks with a very risky move, moving to stab Urda straight at the heart as Urda brings down his health little by little, as he managed to get an opportunity and as she notices, she decides to counter and as the two stab each other in the chest, the game's over with Urda winning the duel.

Heavy breathing from both sides as both pull out their weapons. "Man, if we were just a little more risky, we could have damaged each other for real.." said Mijo, as he lay down on the floor. "Yeah.. Good game to you, but I managed to have enough health to tank that before you lost." responded Urda, as she also sits on the floor.

"Mhmm.. Well, what time is it? It's probably time to go home for today.." asked Mijo, as Urda responded, "Uhh oh, it's 3:30 PM, we should head back, it's a Thursday.. I don't know about you, but our sir is particularly strict, so I gotta go.. See you tomorrow!", as she waves Mijo goodbye as she walks back to enter the light world. He picks up his glasses and starts walking out of the training ground.

"I should head back too, a lot of prep is needed, and I am kinda tired too." muttered Mijo as he walked his way near the exit of the dark world. "Hey~" said Jomi, as she surprises Mijo again with a smile. "H—huh?! Oh, uh.. Jomi.. what do you want?" responded Mijo, as Jomi shows herself in front of him.

"Sooo what do you think..? Any.. complaints?" asked Jomi, as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah, are you done with the potion?"

"No.. I would've told you, anywho... I can see your hesitance and.. conflicted mind. So, I will say that you'll have an... interesting night ahead of you, don't worry.. I am working on it, just see me next week, ok?" responded Jomi, as Mijo sighs heavily and says, "Yeah, yeah.. I am.. just curious, does the.. change of clothes like earlier before the temporary potion, work now?"

"Should be the same, haha.. I can already tell in your eyes what you're thinking, all of it.. Try it, you'll have time to try before tomorrow, and... oh! Yeah, uh.. as for any side effects beside the obvious, this type of magic actually affects _those_ areas, but I'll need more time to figure out specifics, so hey! Why not try everything you've always wanted to try, maybe you'll learn something!" explained Jomi, before winking and gesturing Mijo to leave. "Ugh.. I sure do love and hate having someone like you around.. Anyway, then.. see you next week!" said Mijo, as they waved goodbye to each other.

As he goes out of the dark world and closes the portal for the next few days, he knows that he can't get there tomorrow and then the weekends too. He goes into their classroom and gets his bag as he sees his friends, Ikari already go out, and Lauvielle talking to somebody else. He then picks up his bag and leaves as his other classmates continue cleaning the room. He then checks the time, and it looks like it's 15:50, as he feels the breeze of the wind. He then looks at his phone, and stares at the home screen, knowing if he presses anything he won't ever get out of the internet spiral. Then his thoughts move on to his notes app, maybe he should start a diary of this, or maybe he should continue that memoir disguised as fantasy fiction of his adventures, but as he thinks of this, a certain JR comes up to him, as he exits the classroom.

"Hey. I have a question, is there going to be a chance to open and close the dark world during the morning, before the preparations for students night eventually take over?" asked JR, as Mijo is snapped out of his thoughts and looks at JR and answers, "Maybe.. I'll try to be early tomorrow, but you know me.. Since I largely don't care about the morning 'year-end party', I can maybe sneak it in before it officially starts.. Urda's probably busy with her class, but she might come up.. we'll see."

"Ok. Goodbye. See you tomorrow!" said JR, as he waved goodbye, going out of Mijo's vision by turning a corner. "Oh, right.. I might not care about the morning, but the night.. People say that.. to enjoy this once-a-year event in school, since you only ever get 6 times before it isn't the same anymore, but.. I.. really have well, no one else to _enjoy_ the night, my friends have their own dance, and the others might either leave or hangout with the others, since they're more.. confident?" muttered Mijo to himself, as he leans on a railing overlooking the school near his room.

"This new body too, Jomi's always vague with her words, but.. can't blame her honestly.. It's something I would do if I saw someone go through my situation. Anyways, times like these.. I always think about it, but.. there's just..  little things that I actually change. Huh.. Time often is wasted away by me, but.. I guess this is technically just waiting for my dad to pick me up, but what I could be doing during that time.. It's so much more than.. now. I think my often self-reflections are good, but then I should do something about it, it gets worse since I don't even share this, at least.. not willingly..." said Mijo to himself, as behind him his classmates finish cleaning, lock the classroom and leave.

"Oh, I should go down, and.. *sigh* Rhida's gone.. Welp, my chance with her is gone, anyways.. anything I want to do isn't until I go home, so imma just play some mobile videogames, like.. oooh! A companion game to Shingen Inpakuto, Honkstar Railway!" said Mijo, as he walked down the stairs as he went to a nearby unofficial waiting area that was just a student hangout place that was coincidentally close to the school gate.

He eventually decided to go and walk home. As he settles down in his bed, as he does the usual change to home clothes. Then he goes to his room that had his computer setup, since his house was built with separate shared bedrooms and other rooms used for work or school-related stuff.

"Whew.. Finally home and I can.. experiment. Hopefully they don't notice, or don't just enter my room without noise, I don't really wanna lock it since I'll have to explain why, and.. hopefully I can get this done and then, rest and watch some videos, play some games, et cetera.." muttered Mijo to himself as he enters another room that's used for extra bed space and storage for other people.

"Ok, first.. The obvious first thing that any person would do if they switched bodies is check.. this." said Mijo, as he takes off his glasses and then his pajamas. "Uh.. well, I guess I should.." said Mijo, as he took off his shirt.

Meanwhile in the living room, May and June, his parents are talking about work stuff. 

"Then, this girl was complaining about the foods that the campaign manager gave her since the other side had larger portions, while I was just listening intently trying to be discreet in eavesdropping, afterwards we talked about it, it's just another crazy day of government office volunteering.." ranted May, as June remarks, "Yeah, that's just how people are. It's fine, they probably just got irritated by something else.. I don't want to say what that could be, since it could be anything anyway."

"Oh yeah, food's ready. Call our son." said May, before June walks to where Mijo is. 

As Mijo looks at his body, he gets the urge to see what would happen if he touched it.

"Should I..? Should I? I.. don't think there's anything else to do, I can look at the fit of different clothes later. Uh.. oh no.. that's likely dad... I should immediately dress up and confront him, it's likely dinner time.." said Mijo to himself as he quickly dressed back up, hearing his dad walk to his room. Then he sees his dad and greets him, so they can eat dinner.

Then they eat dinner, as he half-heartedly listens to his parents conversation and after a while he finishes his food. He heads off to his room again afterwards and lays down on the floor while listening to a random long video in his recommendation. 

"Ugh... I really should've just went and talked to someone after closing the dark world.. At least then, I'll have something to look forward to, aside from the food and drinks.. of course." said Mijo as he stared at the ceiling. "I could just play videogames, but Urda isn't online.. Neither is Lauvielle nor Ikari.. Hmm.. I should probably figure out what to do, but.. wait!" muttered Mijo, as he jumped up and stood on his feet.

"The experiment hasn't finished yet! Let's head to the other room again." said Mijo to himself as he walked to the other room and closed the door, making sure to lock it, since he shouldn't be expecting anyone. Then he stripped himself again, taking off his clothes and glasses.

"Ok, alright. Uh.. sooo, i mean.. what else is there to do? It doesn't have the same effect as if I either changed form fully or Jomi manages to go out of the dark world, since relatively a few things change, besides inside me but that's easy.. to hide! Anyway, I should just get on with it, since Jomi likely expects me to do this, and.. this is one of the few times that magic is brought to the light world. So, here goes nothing!" said Mijo, as he starts touching himself in the changes around the chest and crotch areas.

"Huh, that's weird. This.. _aroused_ feeling, it's weird. Is it because of my brain, or is it the magic..? I am going to.. lay down on the bed." said Mijo, as he lay down on the bed pushing away his clothes. "Ugh.. Mmm.. I'm going to stop, I've promised myself to not go too far with this, I.. think it's enough. My.. breathing is noticeably faster and so is my heartbeat.. I.. I am gonna pass out." said Mijo, as he unexpectedly closed his eyes due to mixed euphoria and dizziness that he felt. After an hour or two, a knock is heard at the door as May calls on Mijo, "Mijo! Mijo! Your clothes for tomorrow! Try it out!"

"H—huh..? Oh shi.. Right, the students night! Oh no—" said Mijo as he quickly dresses up and gets his glasses, transforming himself back. "Yeah! Coming! Wait a sec!" shouted Mijo back, as May responded, "Ok! I'll be waiting in the living room!"

"Whew.. Uh.. What happened..? One moment, I was just.. exploring and.. uh.. y—you know what, I am just going to ignore that and quickly go to where she is." said Mijo, before he opened the door, grabbed his phone and left to go to the living room.

"So here's the clothes for the year-end party in the morning, then we switch it out with this one for students night in the afternoon until midnight. Try it out!" said May, as she gestured to Mijo to try the first one. Then Mijo tried the first one as he put down his phone nearby, then went to go behind a big dresser cabinet to change as May looked at her phone, waiting for him.

"Oh no.. If she ever gets curious or wants to see me while I don't expect she could see.. welp, no point in dwelling. I just hope I get lucky." said Mijo as he tries his best to quickly change and then he reveals himself, his clothes being specifically picked out due to a theme of dark academia that the officers of his class decided, with a landslide vote for it due to the other themes not being serious.

"Oh wow, look how handsome you are in that style! What do _you_ think of it?" remarked May, as Mijo responds, "Yeah, it's fine i guess. It fits the theme for sure. Imma go try the other one." as he grabs the second one and goes behind the dresser again, and quickly changes to the second style, a dark blue polo with a large coat. Then he reveals this to his mom.

"Wow, even better.. It was a good decision to reuse those school pants since your polo is also dark blue, the coat looks nice but it might be too hot before night." said May, as Mijo nodded and asked, "Is.. that all, including the rice for tomorrow's school day event?"

"Yeah, change back, and I am going to prepare each of them for tomorrow, have fun tomorrow anak!" said May, as Mijo went and changed back and left to go back to his room after grabbing his phone again. "Whew.. Ok, that's done. Now, where were we.. Oh right, the whole.. experiment. What time even is it?" said Mijo, as he checks the time and sees it is 20:30, it is usually when he and Urda played games, but when he checked her profile, she was offline and most likely accidentally fell asleep again.

"Oh, well. Let's go back to experimenting, I better not lose my mind again." said Mijo, as he put down his phone and headed off to the other room. Then he closed the door, locking it again, then undressed again, taking off his clothes and glasses. "Ok, so.. uh.. I am just gonna continue and stop when it affects me, because.. whatever happened earlier, the memories are far too dizzy to be a success in exploring." said Mijo, before he touched himself in the chest and crotch areas again, then after some short somewhat unintentionally sensual touches, he laid down in the bed again, trying to process and stay conscious, with the same effect as before, heavy breathing, faster heartbeat, and subconscious moving on his hips and legs.

"Wha— What..? Why.. Is this... I.. ugh.. I am going to.. mmm.. just try to stay still, and.. yeah.." said Mijo, as he tried to stay conscious and experience the euphoria of pleasure as well as the overwhelming sense of dizziness from the sudden experience. "Whew.. Come on, stay determined.. Don't lose focus.. just like before.. ahh.. uh.. ok, i am gonna, ah!" said Mijo as he tries to move his body accidentally touching his other parts, stopping him from continuing to move.

"I.. don't think this is normal.. While it.. has some similarities from what I've read.. this is way too.. extreme. What was.. in those two potions? I guess... this is... somewhat brand new.. at least, inferring from Jomi's vague wording..." said Mijo as he stayed still, attempting to wait out the sensation. He waits for a while, but the feeling never goes away, although it is less intense than before.

"Hah.. I can't keep this up, while.. it's so.. intoxicating.. I can't keep this for long.. Wait.. I have to write it down.. My phone..!" said Mijo, as he attempts to go out of bed and get to his phone, as he unlocks the door.

"Just... have to.. get this.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he grabbed his phone and walked quickly as fast as he could, with being dizzy and not having clothes on, and locked his door again, then he stumbles back to his bed, beginning to close his eyes. "No.. I.. have to, go to my notes app, and.. ugh.. No.. video?" said Mijo, as he looked at his phone and focused on the notes then the camera app.

"Ok, record.. Listen, Mijo.. Don't save this video nor should you let anyone but yourself see this, you've made this phone for yourself so.. anything that you see, write it down please.. Now.. no.. uh.. my.. storage.." said Mijo as he closed his eyes and fell unconscious, as the camera continued recording. Then after 2 hours, he finally wakes up in a daze.

"Huh.. Hah? Hah! What? I am still in this form.. and my phone? Oh no, my storage.. It's been recording for two hours, let's see what it recorded." said Mijo, as he stopped the recording and looked at the video, it replayed the first part, the whole message then after losing consciousness, after two minutes, he suddenly sees himself move his hands to the crotch and chest area and moan a bit before he paused and turned the screen off. "N—no... We are not watching me.. doing that for 2 hours. But.. ugh.. is that even me? Is.. Is that me? Is that what I did.. But.. why don't I remember this..? Like.. it's all hazy and dizzy, vaguely pleasurable but.. *sigh* I don't know.. and.. it's 23:30 too.. It's almost time to sleep so I can be early tomorrow..", as he lays down on the bed.

"I.. should check my.. huh?" said Mijo, as he looks into his notifications and sees messages from Urda 1 hour ago. 

Urda: Hey bro wanna play some Shingen Inpakuto? 
Let's do that new character's story quest like that girl with a gun that is a guard?
Oh you might be busy that's fine! I'll save it for saturday then, I'm just going to play in our Digmake Server! You'll have a surprise ;)

"Digmake? Like... the server we paid for 500 pesos? Huh.. It's a sandbox survival game, I wonder what she's trying to do.. blow up my house with TNT? Or replace it with a dirt house? Oh well. It was an hour ago, she must be still there.. But, I still have to continue my Shingen dailies!" said Mijo, as he went out of his bed and dressed up as he got his glasses and he transformed back. "Then let's get my phone and play some Shingen, then hop on the server!" muttered Mijo, as he grabbed his phone then went out of the room as he closed the door.

He went to his computer and started playing videogames, enjoying his time in Shingen and Digmake as he kept his phone charged and off. After a while, he eventually stopped playing and said goodbye to Urda as they logged off the night. He checked the time, and it was 0:30, an hour after the second experiment. He decides it was probably time to sleep and does the routine of cleaning and closing the room for the night before he heads off to his bed. As he does some chores before he heads off to bed, he listens to some videos as he tries to put the events before in the back of his mind, as it brings up memories that he prefers not to think of for now. 

Then he heads off to bed and sleeps, trying to move on and hopefully have a normal day tomorrow, although he sleeps without his glasses and he also grabs a long blanket to hopefully conceal any noticeable changes from his mother since she sleeps near him on another bed in the same room. As he sleeps, he begins to dream about the special events vaguely happening as it distorts to Jomi noticing and watching. In his dream, it is distorted to have more sensual and pleasure than what actually happened as he begins to imagine Jomi observing then ignoring him. Then after 6 hours, he wakes up with a phone alarm playing, as he turns it off with a morning look.

"Agh.. Welp, I guess it's time. I better get my glasses and—" said Mijo, as someone is heard closing on him. "Not this time!" muttered Mijo to himself as he wears his glasses and transforms back. His father arrives and leaves due to seeing him clearly awake so he got out of bed, grabbed his phone and headed off to eat. He eats and then he goes off to shower, not forgetting to transform once inside the shower since it is hidden from anyone else, he notices the changes to how he showers due to the transformation, but he keeps focused at his routine. After showering, he grabs his towel and wears his glasses as he heads off to another room and dresses up as he watches his surroundings making sure no one sees him until he's done. Then he went to the living room to grab his shoes and school I.D.

"I'm just going to clean this.." said June, as he takes the glasses of Mijo to properly clean it with anti-fogging liquid with a large microfiber cloth. He noticed this immediately but he didn't want to draw attention as his chest was getting heavier on his clothes. He continued putting on his shoes as his father finished cleaning and put it down on the table as Mijo grabbed it before June looked at him again, as he transformed back. He then left to go and prepare their vehicle as Mijo put his phone in his sling bag, grabbed his things, looked himself in the mirror then promptly grabbed his face mask then left as May went out of the room to grab something as she noticed Mijo leave. "Bye anak!" said May, as they both wave goodbye to each other.

Then he went to his dad, so they drove to school. As this happens, Mijo is checking on his phone for messages in the classroom GC about the party, then he looks at the rice container that his classmates asked him to bring. Then he checks the other GC to see Urda telling him that she barely managed to get the time to open the dark world before being dragged into her classroom for the class by class party. Then he was dropped off at school as they waved goodbye to each other and he went into school. He brought his rice container on the way, walking up stairs, into their classroom before sneakily going out and jumping in the dark world nearby. He lands to find no one nearby.

"W—wait.. Where is everybody..? Jomi usually meets me here.. Hmm, though she could be just in her castle but.. then where's the bustling atmosphere..?" remarked Mijo, as he walked to Jomi's castle. He then noticed some guards at the entrance as he was stopped by them. "Her Majesty Jomi isn't allowing any lightners nor any of us to enter the castle!" said one of the guards.

"Then where's the others? Where's Jomi?" questioned Mijo, as the guards looked at each other and gave Mijo a piece of paper with Jomi's handwriting.

Hey, If you see this, this means that I have left the castle with some guards to deal with some abyss threats. I am currently writing this in the downtime, but as for now, there was a sudden surge of abyss attacks that just happened, and so I've been focusing my efforts there, sorry if I couldn't be there and I promise I'll be there next time, until then.. follow my orders and leave for now. The other people have either joined me or have joined the other guards in protecting and making shelter. The timeframe is this day, that includes your students night, so good luck there and have fun! 

— signed by Jomi (The Princess~)

"O—oh.. I see.. I'll have to inform the others, have you seen any other lightner?" asked Mijo, as the other guard answered, "We saw Miss Urda enter first and then Sir JR entered before they went to us, we explained the situation then they left."

"I see. I'll go now. Good luck soldiers." said Mijo, as the other guards saluted as he left and returned to the light world. He went out and closed the dark world as JR was waiting for him outside their classroom.

"Hey, you closed the dark world, right?" asked JR, as Mijo nodded and leaned into the wall nearby him. "Well, Jomi said something about the abyss threats, and you said you've been researching about the abyss and the abyss doctor. Soo, any information you can.. share?" asked JR, as Mijo thought about it and answered, "Uh.. Well, I've also been reading about him and have been talking with Jomi a lot, however this one was unexpected, not even we expected it, so I am just waiting until next week or later to see what happens."

"I see, I was also wondering but couldn't ask anyone knowledgeable enough, such as you, or Jomi. Hmm.. Wouldn't this dark world crisis affect the party today?" asked JR, as Mijo answered, "I think so, but I don't know when it will erupt so I guess we have to stay vigilant."

"Welp, I guess we just enjoy until battle is necessary then, are you.. coming in the classroom?" questioned JR, as Mijo smiles and responds, "Just tell them that I am sick or something, I.. got a disguise..!" as he reveals his transformation by taking off his glasses.

"Oh! oh? Magic works in the light world?" questioned JR, as Mijo showed off and answered, "Think so, you'll have to ask Jomi—" as they both say, "But she is busy!"

"Yeah! She is. Anyways, what do you think?" asked Mijo as JR inspects Mijo, "You look like Jomi in a suit honestly." remarks JR, as Mijo nodded and said, "That's true. Anyways are you going in? It looks like it's starting."

"Yeah, uh good luck I guess." said JR, as he went inside and a couple of others started to call on the class. He transformed back to his other form, and chilled outside of the classroom, as he scrolled on his phone. He messages the GC saying that the dark world was closed due to abyss threats and that they should stay vigilant but be informed. He goes back to scrolling his phone.

After a lot of doing nothing, he decides to transform and check out the school, making sure to watch out for other people. There were surveillance cameras, but to the cameras it looked like there was just a student that was walking around, and there could be many reasons why so he also thought of reasons if he ever gets questioned. He is particularly going to a demolished building that was getting prepared for reconstruction but as of right now has no one in it.

"Hey, uhh where _is_ Mijo? Doesn't the message in the GC say that the dark world was closed? Then where is he?!" questioned Ikari, as she sits in a chair in the classroom, as she's talking to Lauvielle. "I don't know.. I was going to ask JR, but he seems busy.." responded Lauvielle, as JR is talking to someone else about something. "And you two have.." said Ikari, before Lauvielle said, "Yeah.. we uh.. have somewhat of a falling out due to our research project having some issues, you get it, Mijo talked about it in our 3-person GC."

"Oh look, he seems to be finished. I'll go ask, he sees me less.. negatively. Than you at least." said Ikari, ss Lauvielle nodded and watched Ikari go towards JR. "Yeah, the zoo party game was a total mess. I don't wanna know what they thought would happen when a bunch of highschoolers scream at each other to find their 'group'." said JR, as Ikari overhears this and says to JR, "Hey JR, I have a question."

"Oh? Yeah, what is it?" asked JR before Ikari answers, "Where is.. Mijo? He uh.. told us about.." she looks around and continues, "the dark, yeah. And I was wondering if.. no, where he is?"

"Oh. Hm." responds JR as he also looked around, before answering, "He's.. hmm, check the GC. I'll post there."

"Oh, ok. I'll await it then." said Ikari, as she goes back near Lauvielle. "Oh? My phone? Ah ok.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari nudges her to check her phone. They go to the gc to see JR typing until a message appeared:

JR: As for @Mijo's whereabouts, he told me to tell you guys he's sick but we know that's codeword for he's not going to attend class for a reason, likely the reason why the dark world was closed, staytuned he might need us

"Oh, so he's like on a quest again, like what Urda told us Jomi is on... They really are.." said Lauvielle, before Ikari interrupted, "Yeah, yeah.. I get it. Hmm, I'm kinda bored.. Why don't we help Mijo? Let's say we want to go the CR, I am sure they won't care."

"Uh... ok. Tara." said Lauvielle as the two excused themselves from the classroom party and headed outside. "Easy. Let's.. huh, who is that?" questioned Ikari, as she looks over to a girl who is headed to the ruins of a demolished building. 

Meanwhile, Mijo has entered the ruins of the demolished area, as he uses his transformation to avoid anyone recognizing him. He was particularly interested how spacious it was and how it was ignored and there has been no effort to close it off. "Huh, this is interesting.. You know, if there was a boss fight here, it would have the space! But.. I am sure nothing bad will happen.. please?" said Mijo to himself, as he heard a loud thud behind his back. "Aw man.." said Mijo, as he turned around to see a dark abyss figure materialize in front of him. "And.. Where's my weapons? Uh, oh no." said Mijo, as he tried to summon his weapons with no response. "You shall submit to the abyss!" said the figure as it sprouted dark wings with a large spear. "Oh no, uh.. stick? That will do." said Mijo, as he grabbed a long wooden stick to protect himself. The dark figure immediately sprung to slash him, easily breaking his stick and forcing him back. "I am soo fucked." said Mijo as he looked at the dark figure walking at him intimidatingly. "Welp, I guess it was good while it lasted.." said Mijo, as the dark figure stabbed him at his chest, making him drop to the ground, as the other two watched at the sidelines.

"T—that abyss monster just killed her! W—we have to get everyone here!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari got her phone to quickly call the others. "Wait.. where's Mijo then? He's supposed to handle stuff like this.." asked Ikari, as they both frantically call their GC. "If he was here, he wouldn't be able to do anything?! We don't have our own magic, so he doesn't but.. how did they appear?!" responded Lauvielle, as the dark figure looked at them menacingly. 

"Ah! Let's run!" said Lauvielle, as Ikari already started running as soon as the dark figure looked. "H—hey! Wait up!" shouted Lauvielle as she ran to Ikari's position.

Meanwhile, Mijo wakes up at an unknown dark space with the same spear still in his chest with his sword stabbed at the ground near him at the center. "Huh..? I.. what.. I am.. not.. dead..? But.. this speAH!" said Mijo, as he grabbed the spear out of him and to the ground, then he falls to the ground. "H—hold on.. this isn't even my original form.. And.. why do I feel weak..? Where am I?" said Mijo, as he slowly and weakly walks to his sword. "Ugh. I.. can't keep.. dying.. like this.. It has been.. 3 times, this keeps happening to me.." said Mijo as he falls to the ground, laying with his back to the floor. "I.. should get the sword at least.. maybe.. I'll have another chance.. again." said Mijo as he mustered his strength to grab the hilt of the sword. "Ugh.. I.. need to continue.. for myself that is. To look at the sun, once more." whispered Mijo, as he grabbed the sword out of the floor with intensity. Then when he wielded it, suddenly everything in his body felt intense pain as he fell to the ground again, dropping his sword nearby. He then stood up, grabbed his sword and summoned the hilt as through immense pain, he cut through the entire space as glasses shatter around him, as he fell into the ground again.

"Mijo.. please wake up..." said Rhida, as Mijo awakes to Rhida, Urda and Lauvielle looking at him with huge concern. "Mijo! Mijo.. you.. almost died!" said Rhida, as she hugs him tightly before going back. "Bro.. You uh.. good? We almost lost you, but we are running out of time.. JR's distraction is barely working.." said Urda, as she and the other two help Mijo up to see the dark figure battle and chase the other lightners. "Y—yeah! Uh, JR told us you used transformation magic so we know that form, a—and.. we called as much backup as possible. I know you probably went here with the intention of not getting us involved, but.." explained Lauvielle before JR called out, "Hey! Get Mijo here already!" and so they quickly went to the dark figure trying to fight them while the others try to dodge and throw rocks and sticks at the figure.

"Stay back. Let me handle this." said Mijo, as he summons a sword and easily parries the dark figure as he ignored all the damage being inflicted and kills the dark figure, making it dissapear along with his sword and power. Then he walked to a nearby rock and sat as the others look at him and where the dark figure was. "Go back to your parties, we all deserve rest. I am staying here, and.. just have fun, ok?" said Mijo, as he stared off into the distance. "The party is actually finished.. It's 11:00 PM.. almost all people who weren't involved already left to dress and prepare for tonight's party." explained JR, as Mijo stayed silent until responding, "Then, go home. I'll see you all later anyway."

"Ok. You heard him, let's go home. We still need to rest, and if anything happens later, well.. we'll need the energy haha.. I am tired." said JR, as he left to get his items. The rest slowly follows as they waved goodbye to Mijo. As he rested and reflected, Urda, Rhida and Ikari were coincidentally right next to each other as the others left.

"Hey, you two.. You uh.. worried about Mijo? He seems to be.. well, going through a lot. I am not sure what he went through as he was.. in my arms but.. seeing his.. transformation and the fact that he hasn't even tried to get his stuff yet, I am.. concerned." said Rhida to the other two as they look at Mijo still staring off into the distance. "Yeah.. But, if you're thinking that we can help him, you should probably exclude me. I am the worst at.. comforting people, and he even comforts me a lot of the time... anyways, my dad's calling. See you two later!" responded Ikari as she left waving goodbye at the other two. "Is.. she saying the truth?" asked Rhida to Urda, as Urda shrugs and answers, "I don't know honestly.. I don't know much about her besides being her research partner, after she switched with her old one.. Mijo told me it was for complicated reasons but.. Lauvielle left early so I can't ask anyone else besides him."

"Uhuh.. Well, someone has to give him his stuff, and the rice container he brought.. Apparently his contribution to the party of his section..?" said Rhida, finding a way to smile amidst her troubled emotions. "Haha, well. I could do it, I guess.. But.. considering previous events.. You should do it." responded Urda, as Rhida blushed and says, "Huh? What? No no way..! Haha, even considering that.. You should do it, you were friends with him longer!"

"Hah? Really, are you missing this opportunity? Come on, sis its like a chance to dance with somebody, like the song they played at the mass demo for some reason.. I got this, you know.. like, I won't be jealous, ok?" retorts Urda, trying to hide her feelings. "I—is that— No way, I am.. not that confident, well no I am confident, just.. that we have a lot of baggage ok? You get it, and his parents might be calling him!" responds Rhida, as she looks over to Mijo then back to Urda. "Right, and that's why you should get this stuff and give it to him, and as he checks his belongings, you can ask him about—" said Urda, before being interrupted by Rhida, "W—what? You have experience? Like you've been trying to see if he likes you back by doing only subtle things to not ruin your relationship?"

"N—no... You're projecting your own actions, I.. uhh don't have any feelings, ok? Just, platonic pure gamer buddies.. always have.. been... Yep..." responds Urda, as she sits down on a nearby chair, now more troubled. "Um.. I.. think we have our own unresolved issues.. I.. didn't know you.. I'll go now." said Rhida, as she gives more space to her and Urda. Then as soon as Rhida was far enough, Mijo finally stood up and saw the two far away from each other, and his things at a table near the two girl's things.

"You two, are you still waiting for your parents?" asked Mijo, as he grabbed his things and checked his phone. The two girls tried to say something, but they fell short on what to say. "I see. Well, here's my glasses.. and oh look, perfect timing, my parents are on the way, judging by the time, they should be near.." continued Mijo, as he wore the glasses, transformed to his old form and was still looking at his phone. "I.. guess I'll be the first one. My parents are here, so.. Um.. hey, uh Mijo. Once the party happens, come meet me at the spot near the CR's, you'll know when.. I.. think. I gotta go now, see you two later!" proposed Rhida as she left, and waved goodbye as Mijo turned his attention to Urda.

"Oh, my turn.. again. Well, I am.. embarassed to say it, but to just confirm, you heard the entire convo earlier, right?" questioned Urda, as Mijo chuckles and answers, "Yeah, unwittingly.. I was going to grab my stuff but, I noticed you three talking so I stayed until done.."

"Oh. Oh. I am.. uh.. it took this long to reveal it huh.. Even after I thought you moved on.. Well, thanks for staying true to me all those times.. I—it's my fault, i guess.. I had.. romantic feelings for you, I should've just told you directly. But, you got her, Rhida.. And, we're just bestfriends." continued Urda, as she teared up a little. "I.. should go.. My parents are calling me and.." said Urda, before Mijo hugged her for a while before she broke away and says, "Thanks. Even though I know what your feelings are, you're still willing to give this.. girl something to hold onto. Goodbye, see ya." said Urda as she waved goodbye before Mijo also went home making sure to not bother her after she turned around and he started walking because his parents were there way earlier than  he expected.

He went home and rested on his bed as he stared at the ceiling, processing the events. He checked the GC to see the messages, there's only from Urda;

Urda: @everyone the current crisis has been temporarily fixed by the Mijo and the gang so enjoy your students night until another one appears lol

"Huh, ok.. Guess I don't need to message then." said Mijo, as he closed his phone and drifted to sleep, as he was still exhausted from the battle. He entered a dream where he was transported to school as he was about to enter it.

"Welp, just another day. Let's go." said Mijo, as he walked until he saw a certain girl that was facing the flag pole, that was directly ahead of him, so she was turned away from him. So he walked to the girl and questioned, "Uh.. who are you?"

"Oh, You don't know? I am you." said the girl, as Mijo responded, "Well, what's your name then?" as she chuckled and said, "It doesn't matter, Jomi.. Mijo.. I am still you..!"

"So, Jomi? What are you doing here? Is this the dark world from my first time, or the light school, the one that's.. real y'know?" questioned Mijo, as the girl responded, "Hmm, it's a bit different, how about you see for yourself..?" said the girl as she disappeared and Mijo quickly turned to see Urda at the open gymnasium. "Uh.. hey?" asked Mijo as he walked up to Urda, she was silent. "Hey..? You ok? You can tell me everything.." continued Mijo, as Urda started crying. "H—hey.. It's fine, just tell me. Please." asked Mijo as he became more distressed and worried. She continued crying for a while as Mijo tried to comfort her but to no avail. She stopped crying suddenly, and as she looked around and saw him, with a sad expression. "Oh, you're here.. I thought you'd already left.. Haha.. Everyone always.. drifts, and.. I am always alone. You get it, right?  Feeling alone while there's so many people around, and being able to make bonds that break every year.. And, the worst part is.. rejection. Haha, I feel like I am hopelessly drifting in life, and when you get that one connection and it just dies..?"

"I.. I.. I know, but.. is this about earlier? I am sorry, ok..? I just.. don't feel the same, even before I transformed. That's why I did actually, but.. I did suspect you for a while, then I thought you moved on.. Should I have—" said Mijo, before Urda interrupted, "No, actually It's all my fault. I don't think I'll ever get it right, and we're separated now right? It doesn't matter. Your words.. mean nothing to me now. I should've stayed by myself, relying on no one. For that, this.. dark power, is mine. I'll create something better.", as she held an unknown source of abyss power.

'H—huh? That doesn't make sense..? Stop blaming yourself! And what are you doing with that power?!" shoutrd Mijo, before Urda disappeared. "Oh, is that a reflection? or nonsensical amalgamation of your worse anxieties about her?" said the certain girl as she appeared behind him. "H—huh? I don't think of her like that! I don't think she hates herself, she probably just misspoke, it will never escalate!" responded Mijo, as the certain raised her eyebrows. "Oh, then you don't get it.. Let me show you the worst of the worst.." said the girl as she made Urda, Rhida and Jomi appear. "W—wait?! Then who are you?" questioned Mijo, as he looked at the three with different looks.

First, from the right to the left, Urda had both of her guns out with a dark blue aura, as well as floating double sword, with a neutral and numb face. Jomi had her long hair on her shoulders with a dark purple aura and a neutral face as she held a hilt at one hand and a blue fireball in the other hand. Rhida had her eyes whitened out as she floats with ice all around her as she wieled an ice sword. "What is this? Why are they just standing around?" questioned Mijo, as the certain girl's voice spoke to him, "These are your worst nightmares!" as the three suddenly teleport near him and start attacking. "My sword!" said Mijo, as he wielded a sword and deflected and parried their attacks as their relentless attacks wear down Mijo, before Jomi stabbed him at his heart. 

"Ah! Ugh.. I.. why.. what.. is this.. a dream?" said Mijo, as he was forced to stand up with immense pain as he looked at the three. "A dream, you needed to know. Now, let us set a scene.." said Jomi, as she set a chair she manifested as the others hold Mijo down. "I.. What is this supposed to be?! Jomi? You should understand, let me out!" shouted Mijo, as Jomi imprisoned her with dark magic. "This, is.. what you deserve." said Jomi, as the three of them tortured Mijo intensely with immense pain as it stayed like this for a while, as he woke up in a cold sweat, tears in his eyes and heavily breathing.

"What was that?! I.. what.. Who.. was that..? And.. I.. can't.. it's just a dream.. right? Haha, yeah.. It's nothing, it.. doesn't represent anything, haha..? I.. uh.. don't.. have anything to talk about, I don't think that dream's real, its just weird hehe.. I.. yeah sure.. Huh? My phone.." muttered Mijo to himself, as he checked his phone to see a message from Urda and Rhida. "Oh, it's them. I better go check their messages." said Mijo as he checks Urda's first. 

Urda: Bro I just got a dream where you like guide me to the school and you got Rhida to freeze my legs then you got Jomi and Rhida to beat me up as you looked at me having a smug face, then you decided to tie me to chair to have me be beat up by you idk if its like special but it wasn't like my other dreams so it could be dark world magic or something

"Oh. Lemme look at Rhida's then." said Mijo as he checks Rhida's message.

Rhida: Idk who to share this to but it includes you so i just had a dream where Jomi guided me to the school then she disappeared as then you appear me completely ignoring me as Urda and Jomi appear behind me to pull me away as you moved closer to me still ignoring me as Urda and Jomi try to beat me up and when I try to stop them you appeared stopping me and making me lose my footing as i fall to the ground and get dragged and tied up as the others bear me up its weird and so extreme but i think you might know what it entails

"Huh. Really? Interesting. They had the same dream but.. Jomi's there and that girl wasn't.. that's weird. I better check with Jomi later." said Mijo, as May calls him to prepare for students night.

After dressing up for students night, wearing a dark blue polo, dark blue pants and a black coat he decided to keep in his sling bag as it was still a bit hot outside. 

"Alright, you look good. Enjoy your night, 'nak!" said May, as he checked his belongings one more time, a ticket that he found while he was going through his stuff, it was the ticket to the students night area. Then his phone, handkerchief, water bottle, and coat. He then went to school as he was brought there by his dad.

"Goodbye anak enjoy your night!" said June, as Mijo entered the school grounds, waving goodbye back as his father left. Then he went inside as a teacher checked his bag for illegal stuff before letting him in, then he went to a student goverment panel where he saw a line for his grade.

"Huh, I guess that's what this is for.. I wonder who put it in here.." said Mijo, as he pulled out his ticket from his wallet and headed to a line, after waiting and being allowed in after signing in into a document, he sat where his fellow classmates are in the left side of the gymnasium as there were thousands of chairs organized. He picked a seat near some people he was acquaintances with and sat down then he saw JR returning from the CR. He sat down soon after.

"Hey, uh who put the ticket to students night on my bag? I wasn't there the entire party, so I couldn't have received it myself.." asked Mijo, as JR smirked and answered, "It was me.. I knew you wouldn't come back anyway, so I grabbed yours and put it in your bag."

"I see.. Thanks dude. Anyways, what do you think about the 'crisis'?" asked Mijo, still using codewords about the dark world related event they experienced earlier. "Hmm, well I think that the main problem likely isn't solved yet, and that's why I am staying here. I was going to leave and not even come here, but due to the issue, as well as the student government oath, I am here." responded JR, as he thought about being elected as a workshop manager in their local school robotics club.

"Cool, cool.. Is _she_ here? asked Mijo, as JR smiled and answered, "Duh. I was actually talking to her earlier, she's right there." as he pointed to a somewhat far away seat where Rhida was talking with some of her friends. "Oh then.. Ok, I'm just going to sit here.." said Mijo, as JR nodded and spoke to other people as he looked at his phone. He saw Ikari and Lauvielle separately panicking to him about being almost late since the time is getting closer to the start of the party. He looked back to his surroundings and saw Urda come in, speaking to her friends. He quickly looked away and took a picture of the general area as he saved it. 

He decided to observe the people coming in while keeping himself busy by looking at the messages of his friends. He saw Leviente come in then Fexili, as the afternoon darkens. After a while, it was pretty much late now but a few people were still coming in. Ikari came in as she walked nearby him and sat behind a couple of chairs that were free.

"Hi! I didn't notice you enter actually, I was looking at Lauvielle's messages, It's a good thing that you arrived, before the gates closed haha." remarked Mijo, as Ikari looked at him and responded, "Yeah, I arrived before I saw your last message, anyway.., Hold on, I'm going to talk to someone else, see you later..!" as Ikari talked to someone nearby.

 He then looked at his phone then back to the people, as he was observing and waiting for the event to start. He eventually saw Lauvielle come in, but he didn't talk to her, he just saw her go and seat at a nearby free chair. He got bored and started to play videogames in his phone before the event started and he put his phone in his bag.

"Hello, hello welcome to the night of your lives! As we celebrate another end of the school year, I would like to inaugurate our new school government, and associated clubs!" said the announcer on the stage. "Oh, it looks like the student government is on their way.." said Mijo to himself, as a bunch of random people, likely officers started to stand and walk near the stage.

"Ugh.. This is boring. I might as well go to the CR now.." said Mijo to himself, as he got out of his seat and went to the CR. Then as he went to the CR he bumped into Urda before going inside. "Oh, hi." said Urda, as Mijo waved and said, "Hi.. I'm going to the CR, so.. we'll talk later!" as he excused himself to continue inside the CR as he doesn't notice Urda's saddened expression.

After finishing, he went out of the CR and decided to head back, going through the same place he bumped into Urda before sitting down and seeing the inauguration happen. " *sigh* You know what, Imma start drinking, this sucks." said Mijo, as he drank the rest of his water bottle. "Oh that's it.." said Mijo, as the inauguration finishes and the other students head back to their seat. Then their school principal starts a speech that Mijo quickly tunes out, "Man, can we just start the party, or will I have to play Plants versus Robots, on my phone.. " said Mijo to himself, as he stared at the stage.

"Or—or.. Maybe some abyss monsters appear and.. wait, no... we're not even sure if we get our powers anymore. And with so many people outside.. Haha, I am kinda wondering.. when's.. the.. dance. Huh, I.. uh.. should.. where is she..?" said Mijo to himself, as he looks around and doesn't see Rhida. "Oh, no. Well, I better get going." said Mijo, as he stood up and rushed to the spot near the CR's Rhida was talking about.

"Uh.. is she here? Oh, that's definitely her." muttered Mijo to himself as he approached Rhida standing at the spot, waiting for him. "H—hey! So, what did you want to talk about..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was silent for a while before answering, "H—honestly.. I don't know.. And, I feel like I should say this now rather than any other time. Mijo, I've always considered my feelings, but.. throughout all of this, you've been.. silent.. You're not the type to not say anything about you, and who _you_ are. So, as.. much as I don't want to hear it... Mijo.. do you _still_ love me?"

Mijo was silent, he was taken aback, but he knew this was coming. But he understood what she was meaning by this, and answered, "I.. I.. guess I should've known you would say this, haha.. I always wondered.. why.. why can't I love you, or why can't I just turn on the switch and I'll be all lovey-dovey and we'll already be dancing on the dance floor... I thought this transformation would change something, if I experience something different I would feel it, but.. nothing. But it's not like I don't care about it, no.. even worse.. I obsess over it, without the love part. I've always been thinking, am I attached to you, because you said so, and so I shall.. or did I decide to 'try' because I got my opportunity..? I don't know, I don't know.. These complicated emotions, especially with the accidental transformation.. I just feel that if I say yes, would I be staying true to myself? You would want me to be me, right? But I don't know who is me, anyway. I've been struggling to think about it over school and dark world matters.. So, do I love you? I... I.. guess not, then.." answered Mijo, before looking at a wall, trying to avoid Rhida's gaze, as he is filled with dread, sadness and confusion.

"I—is that so..? You didn't... But.. why.. and.. *sigh* I.. have to.. excuse myself. Sorry, Mijo." said Rhida, as she rushed away to another private spot in the school. "I knew it.. This day would come. Just.. I wish.. ugh.. It's all gone now, I.. should've just said it to her straight, I.. *sigh* it's all gone. Haha.. I guess, even when your dreams come true, there's still conflict." muttered Mijo to himself, as he was seen by Urda, looking for him. 

"Oh? You're here? Uh.. Guess here goes nothing." said Urda to herself as she went over to Mijo. "Oh, w—what.. Are you here to bring me the second breakup..? Just.. speak." said Mijo, as he also avoids Urda's gaze. "H—huh? What happened..? I.. uh.. guess this is a bad time.." responded Urda, as Mijo continued, "Yes, it's always a bad time.. Now, if you don't have anything to say.. leave me alone."

"Hey? What's with the.. attitude..? Oh no, I see. I'll.. uh.. l—leave.. then." said Urda, realizing the implication, seeing Rhida leave earlier, with tears in her eyes. "Stay. You look like you have some important things to say, so say it now. Don't delay it." said Mijo, now gaining some semblance of toughness to Urda. "Oh, y—you know what, bro.. I think my statement is—" responded Urda, before Mijo, now turning to face Urda, trying to hold his emotions together, and interrupts "Do it. Any semblance of my emotional stability is gone, so carry on."

"Uh.. ok.. Whew... Now.. I completely forgot what I was going to say.. Shit.. Uh.. Hmm... I am sorry that whatever my mess is, you're dealing with it now.. But, uh.. Honestly dude.. I don't know what you two have been through but.. me? I have only realized one thing, I am just.. afraid of losing you. N—not in a romantic way! I think.. But, even with new people in new sections.. I've always gravitated to you, no matter how different we are. Is that why we're best friends? I don't know.. But, I've only realized this after two instances of us almost being separated forever, at least at the time.. Is that, I just don't wanna lose everyone again, not like my life before.. You, my bro.. Symbolize how I liked having true bonds with my friends, and no care for that lovey-dovey stuff, to others.. Especially when we first met, we may seem like a couple but.. we're just best friends, united in.. gaming.. haha.. Um, I get ya.. Having alone time is precious, so.. I'm going to leave. Oh and the speeches are about to end.. I think. Goodbye!" said Urda, as she left with a more happy expression than when she first saw Mijo.

"Haha.. Ok.. ok.. Just.. a lot... Ok, so.. Urda.. Urda.. Ok, I see.. My thoughts have been swirling around her but I realize.. yes.. Ok, we are good friends. That's good. She.. understands I guess. And for Rhida.. I don't know.. It's not done yet. If it was, she would've said so. She needs her private space, and so do I. I.. ok.. So, ok.. I can return to my seat." said Mijo as he starts walking back, hiding his emotions as he looks around the school.

He finally makes it to his seat, as the rest of his classmates clap at the end of the speech. He looks around to see Urda half-asleep, Rhida still gone, Ikari using her phone and Lauvielle talking to someone else. He feels a sense of relief but stays vigilant, wary of the situation unfolding.

Meanwhile at Rhida's spot at some benches that were near a school store. Rhida is seen crying to herself as she tries to keep herself composed to not draw attention to her. "Why.. why.. is he..? ugh... I.. can't believe it.. Is.. everything a lie? Was he just manipulating me? But.. why? I've never actually seen him laugh, and barely a smile or two.. He was always so.. numb? Like, he was a mixture of seriousness, coldness, or always on the verge of bursting to tears or anger.. D—did I do anything wrong? I don't know.. We never properly solved our issues during the fallout between the months.. always getting excuses to Jomi.. I was.. so distraught of myself to lie to Jomi, just so I don't see him. That.. deal? A way of me maneuvering so that I don't have to face him, but no matter what.. Ugh.. But.. even then.. I.. just wish that I got over it, one slip up and now I am trying to pursue someone that.. *gasp* *sigh* I.. is that.. forceful? I don't think so.. But, even then.. He's likely back to his seat, drinking away his sorrows.. He always told me that if he ever had a student night he would spend the night eating and drinking.. But, would he want a dance? Does he like to? I don't get it. He says he doesn't love me, but.. why do I always feel like he's looking at me while I am not.. I've talked to my friends, it seems that he doesn't divulge much to them too.. So, does he think it's one-sided? Does he want to reciprocate it? I.. don't understand how.. someone that you love and that they apparently love you, just.. doesn't? He doesn't hate me.. But, rather.. he's scared of me, because he's compassionate, and a selfless guy but.. he can often devolve himself and put too much to his back. I.. didn't know that this is how you break something up. But.. then again.. I can't just cry here... I have to talk to him. It was a shock to him, so he quickly defended and rationalized his attitude but.. it'd be better if dialogue happened. After all, it's a night of fun.. *sigh* But.. clearly the two of us aren't having fun, so.. one more talk. Then.. I can finally stop this tension and distance between us." said Rhida to herself as a lot of students pass by her. Then she decides to go back to her seat. She intentionally didn't look at Mijo's direction as she sat down.

"Good job with the exams, may your test scores be high and honor before excellence! God is good, all the time!" said the principal before he exited the stage. "That was a great speech by our great and honorable principal! Anywho, let the night start! The dance floor is now, officially open!" announced the announcer on the stage as the rest of the students start going to the dance floor, while pop music plays in the background.

"Oh it's starting. Well, time to go to the foods and drinks section. Hopefully they have the.. IntelC++ drinks, the orange and lemon ones.. specifically." said Mijo, as he stood up, got his bag and went to the school cafeteria, where they were selling a bunch of hotdog sticks and juice drinks. "Thank you." said Mijo as he paid ₱75 for a big hotdog stick and a bottle of IntelC++ lemon version.

He sat down near a couple of chairs and tables, and coincidentally Ikari was there, checking her phone. "Oh hey, what you doing here? I thought you had like.. someone to.." said Mijo, as he looked at Ikari with a sad expression. "Oh, nothing.. Just.. some broken friendships.. That's all.." sarcastically said Ikari, as Mijo became concerned. "O—oh? Uh.. That's.. really unfortunate.." said Mijo, now reflecting on the previous events. "Yeah, you don't know her though. We were best friends before, but.. well, I wanted to dance with her.. But, she.. had a different.. plan of her own." explained Ikari with a stern tone. "I see.. What are you doing now?" said Mijo, as he stood up and finished his food.

"I don't know.. You said to be vigilant so, I am staying here for at least a while.. But, whenever that happens, I guess I'll be ready." responded Ikari, as Mijo began drinking, then saying "Well, this could just be a.. normal day. Aside from the monster earlier. I am sure that, nothing will—" said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida coming to his position. "Will what? Look dude, every time you say that something bad happens.." remarked Urda, as Mijo stayed silent looking at Rhida.

"Oh hey guys! Ikari, Mijo! How's it been?" asked Lauvielle, as Mijo continued to ignore the others. "Terrible, how about you? You seem to have succeeded in your dance with Leviente." responded Ikari, as she pointed to Leviente speaking to his friends. "It's going well.. Not sure, what he's up to. 'One final time' he says. I am always not sure what his riddles and cryptic jokes always mean." answered Lauvielle, as she noticed Mijo's silence. "Hey Mijo, how about you? You won our bet. I 'danced' with him. Your 5₱.. next week? Hopefully before the end of the year.." said Lauvielle to Mijo, as he snapped out of his trance and Mijo responded, "Yeah, yeah.. Haha.. That's what I call, 'motivation'."

"Well, how about that dark world danger that is constantly looming over us..? Any updates? Sorry, my phone's at like 16% so I don't want to open it.." said Lauvielle, as Ikari quickly responded, "If the others aren't stupid, there shouldn't be anything happening yet." as she checked her phone.

"Good, cause.. I have to talk to someone." said Mijo, as he points to Rhida approaching the group as Ikari and Lauvielle notice. "Ohh ok. Yeah imma go to the others, see you!" said Lauvielle as she left and Ikari responds, "Oh ok. I'll be alone here then." said Ikari, as she put on her earbuds to avoid eavesdropping.

"Hi, there.. What do you want..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida looked at him with a neutral expression, trying to hide her crying from earlier. "I.. want to talk about the.. love thing. Do you feel a—anything when you talk to me? Just, I need to know.." asked Rhida, as Mijo is trying to form his words properly. "I know you don't want me to go, but please.. this is the only way we can reconcile.." explained Rhida again, as Mijo is still thinking about what to say.

"Oh no.. Ah! Sorry.. But, Urda just sent an urgent message, there's a dark world opening at *the* place. You know what it is, come on. She said that magic is mixing into our world so we can use our weapons!" said Ikari, as she ran quickly to the ruins of the demolished area. "Of course.. Well.. let's go." remarked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they ran to follow Ikari.

"Hey! What are these guys doing here?! Isn't Jomi supposed to be like.. attacking the abyss monsters?! What are they doing here?!" shouted Urda, as the three arrived around the same time seeing monsters with blades and saws slowly rising from the ground. "I don't know?! I was honestly surprised by earlier! But now.." responded Mijo, as they all summoned their weapons to fight the monsters. "We have a chance." said Mijo, as he charged straight at the enemy as the rest followed and supported him with ranged attacks.

He sliced through the monsters with ferocious intent and the outpour of his emotions in his battle form is clearly shown as he battles a big abyss monster with two big shields in its hands. "Ice Shock!" shouted Rhida, as ice flew from her hands protecting Mijo from the rest of the abyss monsters. "My power is absolute!" said Mijo, as he dashed through space and slowed down time, striking the enemy with carefully placed slashes as he sheathed his blade, causing glass to shatter around him. "Mijo! You know that our ultimates—" shouted Urda as she shot her two pistols as fast as possible, while dodging around with the wind. "Yeah— I know.. But we don't need to last a long time, just enough for others to get here." responded Mijo, as he tried to focus on his movement. "Have you guys ever fought someone outside of the dark worlds?! It's.. rough!" said Ikari, as she tries to not die, as she  shoots her rifle at the enemy while running away against the other enemies.

"Once or twice.." answered Mijo, as he parried an attack from the big shield guy then he counterattacked with a jump to a mid-air plunge attack, knocking the big guy. "I am surprised that my—" said Mijo, before he was cut by the right part of his abdomen, knocking him back and his glasses to the ground. "Winter.. Storm!" shouted Rhida, freezing all available enemies as the others cleaned up. "Don't worry.. I am still here.. Just, a bit different!" said Mijo, as he regained his footing and put his glasses in his pockets, transforming to his other form. "They might break, but.. I got no choice... My power.. shall be absolute!" said Mijo, as he does his ultimate again, taking out all abyss monsters in the area including the big guy as he fell on his knees almost falling down, but managing to barely hold on.

"Mijo are you fine?!" shouted Rhida, as she went closer to Mijo. "Where are the others?!" questioned Ikari, as she also went to Mijo. "Watch out! Second wave!" shouted Urda, as monsters spawn around them and the abyss monsters managed to stab the other two, Rhida and Ikari. "Agh! What?!" screamed Ikari, as she was dragged by the blades of an abyss monster. "Ah! I—is this what pain.. feels like..?" said Rhida, as she was also dragged away by an abyss monster. "Mijo! Rhida! Ikari! Shit, shit.. I am trying to help! Hold on!" shouted Urda as she maneuvered around trying to get to the other three. "I.. need to help.. Agh! But.. why.." said Mijo, as he was wrapped around by random tentacles.

"I got you! Shit— Agh! Oof..." said Urda, as she was knocked by an abyss monster to the ground as she was near Mijo. "To live.. Ugh.. I must.. agh!?! What is this? I.. remember this.. abyss power.." said Mijo, as his energy was being corrupted by abyss magic. "I can't think straight.. My vision.. It knows.. it can't kill me, but.. ugh.. Ah..!" said Mijo as he tried to break out with little change. "Euphoria..? What.. is it doing..?" muttered Mijo, as his mind is swirling around, barely holding on to keep his sanity alive. "Ugh.. Just.. I guess.. this is worse.. than death..." said Mijo, as a mix of pleasure and dizziness took over his mind fully and he was dropped down by the tentacle abyss monster.

"Mijo? Mijo?!" said Urda, as Mijo is holding a sword that is not his, and with ripped clothes, almost like he was forcefully dragged by the monster to inject its magic. "Mijo? For the love of god.. Rhida and Ikari are here.. Don't.. kill us.." bargained Urda, as she prepared her blade for a potential fight. "What?! He really gonna turn on us now?!" said Ikari, as she was healed by Rhida. "N—no.. That's not him. He's.. *sigh* " responded Rhida, as the other two stood off. "That.. tentacle monster.. It's worse than trying to kill us, it's trying to **_corrupt_** us.. But.. How.. with him.." muttered Urda to herself, as she prepared her wind blades.

"Damn.. where the _fuck_ are the others?! We've been fighting for the past hour..! And now, fuckin Mijo is about to kill us!!" shouted Ikari as she tried to get up and run away. "Fuck this, I better get help. As I have already seen, he's gonna fuckin' kill us if he tries." said Ikari, as she runs from the place but then she gets stopped by an unknown barrier as she is knocked to the ground. "What? Fuck, we're dead.." said Ikari, as Rhida also notices that she hit a barrier that traps them in the area.

"N—no.. Then, what's happening with the others? If we're trapped since earlier, then we would've not been able to notice anything else happening outside.." remarked Rhida, as Mijo jumps to pluge on the group. "Watch out!" shouted Urda as she teleported near the others to deflect his plunge as he is knocked back on his feet. "These monsters, and Mijo.. We might have to defeat them.." said Urda, as she stood guard to protect Rhida, as Ikari quickly moved behind Urda, panicking internally. "Imma be real, we are not winning.." said Ikari, as she pointed her guns to the other monsters surrounding them. "But.. I am not dying like a bitch." said Ikari, as the other two also attacked the monsters, with Urda focusing at Mijo.

Urda clashed with Mijo, mirroring their spars. Mijo is the first one to strike by using dark magic to blast her back as a large strike, as she deflected it however she was pushed back by a bit. Then Mijo followed up with multiple slashes as Urda dodges easily and manages to get close to Mijo to attack him, but he blasted her away with dark magic, this time knocking her back from him by a lot. She got up and realized that the blast had damaged her clothes and was noticeably hurting more than normal. But she had to quickly focus at Mijo walking at her menacingly, as she ran to face him again. 

As she was about to clash blades with him, he suddenly dodges away from her and to Rhida. "What?! Hey!" shouted Urda, as she looks at Mijo surprise Rhida with an attack shattering her ice wall and knocking her back as Urda managed to get a hit on Mijo on his arm. He was unfazed then he knocked her back. "Don't worry! I got this!! FUUCK YOU!!!" screamed Ikari, as her gun overloads to launch a large flame projectile towards Mijo. As the flame engulfs it's surroundings, Ikari is slowly walking back from the destruction before being surprised by a seemingly fire-immune Mijo striking her, blowing her back to a wall knocking her down.

"Ugh.. Fuck.. Damn.. why did he had to be turned to the dark side.. I swear.. if any one of us were turned, it would've been quite easy.." muttered Ikari, as the flame dissipates, revealing the damage to the others due to their location near the explosive range. "Oh.. great. They're also damaged.. Huh.. can never.. seem to get it right.." remarked Ikari, as she looks at the other two on the ground. Mijo approaches her with  determined look as she looks over to him. "Hey.. is this the part where you kill me?! Just.. get it over with.. I am tired." said Ikari, as she looks at him, completely determined but clearly not in control, as his eyes now glow with purple. As he was about to raise his blade, Rhida managed to blast ice to Mijo, getting his attention. "H—hey! You'll not _ruin_ a single life anymore!" shouted Rhida as she was floating with ice all around her. "I might have been holding back, but Mijo wouldn't want us to, so.. this is.. ___WINTER STORM!"___ shouted Rhida as a blizzard from out of nowhere is summoned as Mijo focused at Rhida launching multiple slashes all being blocked by a huge ice wall.

"Ugh.. well.. fuck me.." muttered Ikari, as she layed down on the ground, seeing the impending doom. "Oh no.. This.. is not good.. She'll.. agh..!" said Urda as she tries to stumble her way to Rhida, but falling to the ground head first. "Ugh.. This.. is suicide. Hah, guess that's why they're a couple haha.. ugh.. Goodbye world.." said Urda as she stared at Rhida preparing her ultimate. "___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouted Rhida as she launched the blizzard freezing all living beings, as she drops down to the floor. "I.. can't believe it.. he's still.. *there.*" said Rhida, as she sees a Mijo covered in ice but moving towards her, walking slowly. "My.. power.. I.. ugh.. there's nothing else we can do.." said Rhida, as she looked at Mijo with his blade pointed at her. As Mijo walks up to her, his blade maintained pointed at her, as she closes her eyes for the inevitability of death. But as she waited, she could feel no blade touch her, so she opened her eyes a bit to see his blade shaking. "What.. Is he.. hesitating..? Is he.. breaking out..?" remarked Rhida as she looks at his blade then to his eyes, noticeably the left eye was being turned blue from purple, but it was being turned back to purple, like his body and power is being fought by two parties, the corruption and Mijo.

Mijo walks back, as the blade is being turned towards himself. He struggles as he turned his blade towards his heart before stabbing himself. He falls to the ground, as Rhida calls out, "Mijo! NO! Please, please.. live..", while struggling to get to him. He's clearly in pain as he looks at the ground, trying to fight for his body back. "My Mijo.. come back.. Please.. I.. love you.. Ugh.." said Rhida to Mijo, as she succumbed to her injuries and fainted. As he witnesses her close her eyes, he reaches out before being forced back, holding the sword in his heart. He finally broke out as he stood up, but was knocked to the right of his position. He looks and sees a figure that looks similar to him but with the sword that is not his. "Who are you?!" said Mijo, as he manifests his sword out of nowhere with its scabbard. The figure then attacks him, but he dodges and slices the right abdomen of the figure. The figure stumbles as he retaliates with summoning slashes, as the figure reflects it to him, forcing him to dodge. "Like I said, who the fudge are you?! " questioned Mijo, as he summons small blades to attack the figure as he focuses on the figure before the figure gets behind him and manages to get a small cut before Mijo deflects and manages to get a huge wound on the figure's chest. The figure retreats from him and tries to heal themselves. The blizzard stops as the area becomes clearer as the other three remain unconscious, now being obvious to Mijo.

"**Explain yourself.** Who are you, and.. why do you exist?" said Mijo with spite, as the figure finally looks at him, revealing his face. "Oho.. A *doppelganger* huh? A corrupted version, well.. of course.." remarked Mijo, as he stares down at his doppelganger. "Your presence is only restricting us from **full power.** Give up, in your friends, lovers, everyone. You have killed them anyway, so.. *submit.* While you can." said the doppelganger with clear anger and madness. "What should I call you.. Jomi? No.. you don't deserve a name." said Mijo, mocking the doppelganger, as the doppelganger smiles and says, "No need. I'll call myself, ***Cara.*** We share a name, I am Mijo Cara."

"It's insane how you think you are me. You are not. 'Cara'? Really? Couldn't come up with an original name? Ok then, Cara.. Let's dance." said Mijo, as the two faced off, waiting for the other to attack first. "You are inherently weaker.. Your body is your transformation, and with us separate. You can no longer rely on yourself." said Cara, as he mocked Mijo, noticing his magic less powerful than what he expected it would be. "I'll still beat you, by myself. I only need my perseverance and will. You are nothing but an abyss monster pretending to be me." responded Mijo, as the two glared at each other intently. "Weakling. Pathetic. Scum." said Cara, as he attacked first, crossing blades with Mijo.

Mijo retreats and keeps a defensive stance as Mijo says to himself, "Damn it.. he's right.. This split is affecting me a lot, I can't use my magic properly.. While he seems to be unaffected.." as Cara smiles menacingly and attacks him, making him deflect but forcing him to lose further ground to the wall. "Damn. My offense is limited, I wonder if.. **they** can still fight?" said Mijo, as he intentionally starts hurling a bunch of slashes as he moves to the left to get to Urda. "What? Trying to revive your friends? Haha.. Even if you got all three, you would still succumb to me." said Cara, as he kept parrying his slashes.

"It doesn't hurt to try!" said Mijo, as he got to Urda, covered in snow and unconscious. "Oh it will.. Such is the way of the light." said Cara, as he stops attacking to see Mijo attempt to wake Urda up. "Stardust Crusader.. May you stand again and fight for yourself.." said Mijo, as he heals Urda, noticeably hurting himself in the process. "What is this.." questioned Mijo, as he continued healing Urda, persevering through the pain. "You'll see very soon.. Haha.." responded Cara, as Mijo finished and he walked back a bit as Urda woke up. "What.. Mijo? and.. Mijo?! Shit.. which one of you is the real one?!" questioned Urda, as she sees Mijo from the right and Cara to the left.

"No need. You shall see!" said Cara, as he quickly attacks her, forcing Mijo to defend her position, pushing Cara back, but weakening Mijo a bit. "Mijo?! Who the heck is that clone of yours?!" questioned Urda, as she stood up and summoned her weapons. "No clue. Just.. ugh.." said Mijo, before he fell to his knees, succumbing to the pain a bit. "Mijo?! Damn you whoever you are, so.. you've been the one hurting my friends?!" questioned Urda to Cara, as he laughs maniacally and says sardonically, "Haha!! Here I am.. Got a problem?" said Cara, as Urda jumps to attack him but Cara manages to reflect her, forcing her back on her feet. 

She ran to Mijo and said, "Mijo?! Are you fine?! Hold on, I have some—". before Mijo quickly rejects her potions of healing and says, "No.. go to the others.. And revive them instead. I'll handle him." said Mijo, as he stood up and was still shaking as he ran to attack Cara. "Got it." said Urda, as she ran to a nearby Rhida. He attacks Cara, as Cara easily defends and manages to push him back using a dark blast. "I'll fight.. my own path! You.. whoever you are.. shall *die!*" shouted Mijo, as he relentlessly attacked Cara, while Cara smiled all the way, not even trying sometimes. Meanwhile Urda is healing Rhida, and Rhida wakes up and asks, "Huh..? What.. happened?"

"Mijo is fighting his clone while I am trying to heal us back, you got any consumables with you?" answered Urda, as Rhida smiles and responds, "I—I think so.. Is.. Mijo going to be fine?", as she gives Urda some health snacks and drinks. "I.. uh.. to be honest.. I don't know. He's uh.. doing fine, but.. it's clear he's.. in pain, a lot. Like way too much, something that an emo person would dream of haha.." responded Urda, as she heals Rhida enough so she could stand up. "Uh.. I.. understand. Let's heal Ikari, then we'll help him." said Rhida, as they ran to Ikari's position. 

"My my.. Getting restless, are we?" mocked Cara, as Mijo maintained his battle stance, and responds, "Yeah, what about it? I am not giving up, ever." "Sure, sure.. You might not be giving up, but your magic, your ___power___ is fading.. It's only a matter of time hehe.. That is why I don't need to fight you. Then, my ***power*** is also increasing with it, like.. transfering the true authority to me." said Cara, as Mijo tries to focus at fighting but he knows that what Cara is saying is true. "Even so. My friends are here, and they hold no mercy for you. Especially when I am here." responds Mijo, as Cara maniacally laughs and says, "We shall see.. But we know the end. Your friends dead, disintegrated and you having to submit to me, **fully.**"

Rhida and Urda come up to Ikari and they heal her, "Woah! Ugh.. This.. is.. my weapon, and you two are Urda and Rhida.. Is this the afterlife?" asked Ikari, as the other two helped her get up. "No. You might even say it's still hell.." answered Urda, as she points to the duel between Mijo and Cara. "Oh! I see Mijo has broken out, but who is he fighting?" asked Ikari, as Rhida responds, "You'll know him. Let's help Mijo." as they ran to Mijo's position.

"Agh... Fuck.. I am so.. **angry** at you, but ugh.. no matter what, I can't win.." said Mijo, after getting knocked back by Cara as he easily outpowered Mijo when they crossed blades. "Haha.. That's it.. Embrace the anger, embrace it!" responded Cara, as he continued attacking Mijo, forcing Mijo to defend until a surprise attack from Urda caused Cara to retreat back. "You will stop hurting Mijo ___now!___" said Urda, as she glared down Cara with wind around her getting stronger. "Oho? Your friends are back.. that's nice.. Then.. this will prove our strength, we don't need anyone, haha." responds Cara, as he transforms his sword into a massive broadblade that is now filled to the brim with Mijo's and abyss magic. "*Let's dance.*" said Cara, as he laughs maniacally.

"*Golden Wind!*" said Urda, as she unleashed her ultimate, moving at lightspeed making Cara parry all her slashes, but now being vulnerable to the shots by Urda and her burning rock projectiles and Rhida's ice making his movement worse forcing him back. "Combined Assault? You learn that after your defeat? How pathetic, you were only a given second chance." said Cara, as he jumped in the air and headed for Ikari, forcing Urda to stop him mid-air using her wind, so that Ikari can charge her gun to fire a large burning projectile to knock him back to the ground. Then Rhida used her ice gain to restrict his movement, this time with an intense blizzard being directed to Cara. "Haha.. Even so.. You shall die!" shouted Cara, as he unleased his sword at light speed, making the other three easily hit by Cara, damaging the three of them. "I can use speed too, Urda! The best part? I only need to use it **twice.**" said Cara, as he smirked and stopped to look at the three getting up. 

"Ugh.. I can't take it.. anymore.. My mind wants to continue but my body is.. fading.." said Urda, as she looks at Cara standing there, looking at her. "Ugh.. I.. if I use.. it again.. I''ll not survive another day. He's.. right, ugh." said Rhida, as she heard Urda's words. "Whew.. I guess.. uh.. I am gonna die again, soo fun." responded Ikari to the other two, as she struggles to handle her gun due to her injuries. 

"I.. can't stay.. like this. I can't give up yet, there is a light that must be buried." said Mijo, as he stood up again, with pain and suffering at every second he remains determined and motivated. "Through vacant halls, I won't surrender!" shouted Mijo, as he ran to face Cara. "Oho? Stop in your fantasies, my Mijo.. I am sure we both know what's the outcome." responded Cara, as Mijo stopped and glared at him. "Forsakened, I am awakened.. ***I AM HERE TO RECLAIM MY NAME!***" said Mijo before charging straight at Cara, attacking and defending as much as he can, testing Cara a bit. "If you want the power, then come try and take it!" said Cara, as he defended against Mijo's barrage of attacks. "I will." answered Mijo, as he dodged and parried all attacks of Cara, with neither of them getting hits in each other. 

"Look.. He's still fighting.. I.. can't give up yet.. I must stay determined." said Urda, as she observes the battle and uses her powers to maintain her footing and launches herself into the air to unleash a barrage of slashes at Cara. "This is fun. No distractions—" said Cara, before getting hit by Urda. Mijo instantly attacks and manages to get a lot of hits before Cara manages to stop Mijo, but the damage was already done. "Ugh.. Of course.. only when you get your so-called motivation, you get a few hits.." said Cara, before Mijo followed with a barrage of slashes forcing Cara to dodge.

"Ah? Is that.. Urda? and.. Mijo? I.. have to.. help them. No matter what happens, even if.. ugh.." said Rhida, as Ikari stood up and shouted, "Hah! You're getting beat by the power of friendship! It starts with this!" as she blasted Cara with a lot of burning projectiles like arrows, rocks and bullets, all headed to Cara. "I.. hmmm.. Let's do it." said Rhida, as she looks at Cara, struggling to maintain his health as he dodges the attacks from the other two while trying to parry and counter attack Mijo's attacks. "Here it goes.." she says, as she looks at Mijo another time. "I am sorry.. ___ETERNAL STORM!___" shouts Rhida, as she floats and her eyes turn white as a huge blizzard starts forming.

"Oh no.." said Urda as she witnessed Rhida charging her ultimate. "Huh? Wow.. ok..?" reacted Ikari, as she looked at Rhida floating with wind and snow swirling around them. Mijo looks at Rhida and realizes what he has to do. "A storm is approaching.. There's only one thing I should do. **_I shall be the storm that is approaching._**" declared Mijo, as he used the last of his lightning magic to influence the blizzard causing it to be even more extreme and chaotic than ever before.

"What a show.. Let's see if it pays off.. Hah?" said Cara, as he looks at the huge blizzard and thunderstorm mix slowly forming. "Huh?! Mijo?!  What are you—" said Rhida, as she noticed Mijo influencing the storm. "Do it, now!" shouted Mijo, as he's barely holding the storm and himself together. "Ah— Ok!" responded Rhida, as she unleashed the blizzard-storm mix, decimating everything in its path as everything is swallowed inside as everyone's vision fades to black.

Mijo wakes up in a familiar dark space, with a figure in front of him turned their back so familiar yet different. "What.. happened?" asked Jomi, as he recognizes her voice and is relieved as he stands up again. "I.. uh.. honestly.. I don't know.. I was.. too busy with my.. I mean— the party, to figure out anything happening.. I just followed my heart, and my mind.. So many things happened in the blink of an eye.. I am.. overwhelmed." answered Mijo, as he sat down on the floor, contemplating.

"You're lucky again, y'know? After hearing that, I.. am not surprised by what I saw. Did you know you were fighting in the dark world? That _abyss doctor_.. He found a way to.. disrupt our life **again**." explained Jomi as she turned to face Mijo, revealing her tattered and battered look, seeing as her clothes were cut and torn due to battle. "What.. happened..? to you, I mean." asked Mijo as she looked somewhere else, looking conflicted. "I.. think we should focus on you first. Let me set a scene, me and my guards saw three bodies and traces of abyss magic. Who were you fighting, exactly?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo tries to remember the  chaotic events earlier.

"Uhuh.. Well.. mm... They were definitely abyss monsters. They seem organized and controlled by someone, likely a subordinate of the _doctor_.." answered Mijo, as he remembers the previous events and is intentionally choosing his words. "I see.. It's as expected.. So, tell me.. Mijo, why do the most concentration of abyss magic trace back to **you?**" questioned Jomi, with her eyes narrowed to Mijo's trying to not look at her. "Uh haha... Uh.. it's a long story.. I'd prefer if we do not discuss it." responded Mijo, as Jomi unsheathed her sword to point it at Mijo, as Mijo walks back a bit and looks at a Jomi, who now has a more tense facial expression. "Explain yourself, or else." said Jomi, as Mijo held back his magic to not provoke Jomi and answered, "I.. ugh.. It.. starts with right after I went home." as Jomi sheathes her sword and says, "Go on."

"Well.. All I can say is, you know that.. potion you gave me? I decided to *sigh* experiment a bit.. after making I sure was alone, it was.. a strange feeling. It wasn't normal, I don't think any type of transformation can make you.. uh.." explained Mijo, before struggling to say the words that won't make him look worse. "What..? Say it. We're the only two here. Here's the thing, since you.. with your amazing magic used something, and now.. you're pretty much the only one like.. **'dead'** as in.. your friends are fine, however due to the insane use of magic during that battle they're knocked out, at least for now.. I can.. heal them, but.. I need to know the details first." interrupted Jomi, as Mijo was shocked at these words and remarked, "Huh..? I am dead? Like.. for real? Is this my dying consciousness or something?"

"No. *sigh* To be honest, you were about to die when I saw you three. Your body has been beaten so many times, more than the others actually. It doesn't help that your transformation glasses have been broken, likely in the battle. I am.. keeping you alive, as always. I knew that you were most likely the biggest catalyst of any potential surge of intense magic, at least.. not abyss ones." answered Jomi, as Mijo was relieved and responds, "Whew.. I.. survive another day. Uh.. want me to continue?" as Jomi nods and Mijo continues, "Well, the 'horny' effect." before Jomi snickered and commented, "Oho? Really..? The first thing you did was to.. touch yourself like a pervert? Y'know.. That indirectly says something about your attitude to transformation and me."

"Ugh.. I really didn't want to tell you now, but.. it's important, I swear!" explained Mijo, as Jomi keeps giggling a bit and remarks, "Is it..? Haha.. It's not like I don't know your preferences, but it's still funny to me whenever you admit it, like.. the so many times that you accidently say things about it.. Haha.." as Mijo blushes at the embarassment but continues, "A—anyways.. About the effect¸ it is the same thing when.. *sigh* we got beaten by the abyss monsters."

Jomi raised her eyebrows and asked, "Woah? You got defeated, big surprise.. But, whoever was your enemy.. They got defeated, right?" as Mijo quickly answered, "Yeah.. I'm just going to say it, I was corrupted by the abyss." before Jomi raised one of her eyebrows, questioning what she had just heard. "Huh.. I am starting to get the picture.. Did you wield the abyss sword we found?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo expressed disappointment at himself.

"I.. Yes. I did. I.. basically got influenced by whatever they did to me that had the same effect, I also broke out of it and fought this manifestation of my corrupted form named.. Cara, you know something about it, Jomi? Considering our.. connection?" answered Mijo, as Jomi thought about it for a while, perusing her mind for an answer. "Hmm, I've always thought something about a third version of you appearing, but.. I've always thought it would be when the abyss doctor introduces them.. It's just a theory though, and.. this explains why I was also weakened a bit during my.. expedition. I have to confirm this, but my theory is that there's a light and dark version of each individual, it was simply a coincidence that we met first. But due to the nature of abyss magic, perhaps it can make more copies but is less sane and more unstable. It also probably takes any magic it can find, and I also happen to control some abyss magic for myself."

"Wow.. I agree. But only because I know as much in the dark world as I do in school, absolutely almost nothing. Even If I do, only a  grain of rice.." responded Mijo, as Jomi quickly comments, "Well, I don't know about that one.. You seem less confident than ever previously due to learning a lot of info about stuff in a week followed by weeks of normalcy. It's fiine. I am literally you, and you are me, it is that simple." 

"Yeah yeah. I know.. No need to remind me, actually.. I just.. have a lot to think about. L—lets continue." said Mijo, as he stops for a moment to recollect his thoughts before continuing, "So to fight this abyss monster, we had to launch a powerful blizzard—thunderstorm attack, and amplified by **my** use of my friend's magic, I didn't realize it but then I saw that I was also grabbing aero and fire magic to mix in, resulting in the most chaotic, destructive and powerful storm I've ever seen.." explained Mijo, as Jomi stayed silent for quite a while, before responding, "I see.. I think I get it now. Hmm, it seems that the **_abyss doctor_** was targeting you. To make sure he succeeded, he distracted me. Then he attacked your party, surprising you at your weakest, and by doing this he can gain control of a powerful enemy, as well as weaken a strong one. He's likely testing something, again. All we can do is to prepare for the worst."

"Uh.. when will he do something again?" asked Mijo as Jomi quickly responded, "I don't know. I saw signs of his presence but he wasn't present for the battles. Just.. enjoy the rest of your night." as Mijo stood up and questioned, "Cool, how do I revive again?" before Jomi answered, "Stay here. I'll leave and revive you fully, you're going to wake up in the dark world though, you need to close the fountain first."

"Oh yeah, well.. see you, Jomi." responds Mijo, as Jomi nodded and opened a portal as she looked at him one more time before heading out. Then as he looked around, suddenly he couldn't stop himself from dropping to the floor, as he woke up and saw the dark fountain. He looked around to see Jomi healing the other lightners, as he looked back at the dark fountain.

"I guess, I should close it then." muttered Mijo to himself as he went near the dark fountain and closed it as light took over his vision. He woke up at the light world laying down at the ruins of the building they went to. His transformation is still there, however due to the battle, his glasses are more scratched up and are more prone to breaking fully. He stands up, noticing that his body was more weak when he entered and he quickly wore his glasses, before looking at his friends, all slowly waking up. 

"Hey.. So.. the abyss threat has been neutralized for now, Jomi arrived to support us and we can finally rest for today." said Mijo, as the other three acknowledge Mijo's words in various nods and hums. "Oh, finally.. Damn that girl took a while, how about the others, Lauvielle.. JR?" asked Ikari, as Lauvielle, Leviente, Jamise and JR arrived at their location. "We're here! Uh.. where's the enemy?" said Lauvielle, as Mijo, Rhida, Ikari and Urda look at her.

"You guys arrived late, we.. dealt with it." responded Urda, as the newly arrived lightners all express forms of disappointment. "Woah no way.. We fought through hundreds of monsters, and.. huh? Our weapons, they just disappeared?!" said Jamise, as she realizes her wooden staff is gone as all the others notice their weapons couldn't be summoned anymore.

"Oh, right. We were flashed by a huge light before getting our footing and going here. That's probably the closure of the dark world we fell on." explained JR. "Mhmm.. All we saw and heard was a huge explosion, we assumed that was the dark world and started heading but then we saw a bunch of abyss monsters appear around us, we couldn't leave the unconscious people be potentially threatened so we stayed to fight them." added Leviente, as the others processed the statement, "Although, they seem that they were targeting us.. It's weird, why didn't they get dark world magic?" commented Jamise, as she narrowed her eyes a bit.

"This was a bit different than normal dark world explosions, but it hasn't been the same since the intramurals.. Maybe the ***abyss order*** are trying something different?" responded Mijo. "There's nothing we **can** do anyway. Mijo mentioned that as of right now, the ***abyss*** can't and likely won't do anything, at least.. according to Jomi." remarked Rhida, as the various ligthners agree at Rhida's statement, some more happy than the others. "Well, at least we got to fight. I see that as a win!" exclaimed Jamise, her enthusiastic energy being recieved by others differently, ranging from that same excitedness to a slight amusement at her statement. 

"Well, I guess that's that.. I am sure y'all have your own things to do, so the world is *saved!* again.. see you. " said Mijo, before everyone separates from the group, with only Rhida staying behind. "So.." said Mijo, as he noticed Rhida looking at some rocks, averting his gaze. "Uh.." continued Mijo, trying to come up with a word to say to Rhida as she stays silent. "*sigh* Answer the question, Mijo." said Rhida, as she finally gets the courage to look at Mijo again trying to keep a neutral face. "I.. I know. *sigh* Look, I.. I am sorry, ok? I just.. can't express love the same way you do. But, to answer.." he stops for a moment, then continues, "Yes. I do. Very much. But.. I can't help myself, I've never really experienced those types of relationships, nor do I have a natural affinity with them. I uh.. have been considering why I have these problems, but.. hmm.. It might be because I haven't experienced it myself, or genetics.. Either way, what I am trying to say is.. I am.. trying, as much as I can."

They are both silent for a minute or two, before Rhida responds, "Ah.. I see..  *sigh* I'd kinda wish that everytime we saw each other we had a fun time.. However, before the dark world.. We'd **never** interact much, I— I don't know why, I just wanted to both connect but at the same time I didn't really know you much, besides your reputation as a computer expert... I just knew that I had something for you; I'd first hide it.. But often, love gets discussed, so they get.. **revealed**. Soon enough, they'd push me to you, trying to help me overcome my fears and talk to you.. But, nothing really came of it.. I had a few **scares** actually. But it seemed that everytime we talked it was always small and.. like we were just.. classmates. The other times, it seems like you were intentionally trying to get my attention or were standing next to me but then leaving. But.. I'm not the one to pry into anyone's secrets.. I don't know if you remember this, but before the dark world, we had a.. few interactions, that.. genuinely **scared** me that you didn't **reciprocate**.. I am not sure.. what you thought since you were always casual with these things. Since.. school was ending, I was ready to move on but, soon after.. the dark world happened. And, in the following days of that whole starting point, I quickly became attached, especially that first time in that snowy world. Then the feats we did, the accomplishments you boasted, it was.. a **rekindling**. But, after that fateful last day.. I.." she stops herself as she held back tears. Mijo went to her side to comfort her, before he went back after she calmed down a bit.

"I.. couldn't bear you **dying**, and even if you didn't, we would've likely been separated in the future. I.. just.. had to confess right there, before the major battle. But, you looked conflicted, I was.. **horrified** that you were going to reject me but, you just left.. without saying anything. Afterwards, we didn't meet and I didn't see you for quite a while. Even during the next school year, you intentionally avoided me and my presence, it wasn't until the intramurals where we got our first proper conversation, even then.. It was so **short**, it didn't do **anything**. So, now we're here.." continued Rhida, as Mijo listened intently hiding his reactions for now. 

"I see. It wasn't the **best** way to say goodbye, but it made sense at the time.. *sigh* I can't **justify** that. After that I couldn't look at you the same way again.. It was embarassing, if I looked at you.. even for a second.. If I did, there was a chance you would look at me, and I.. was.. a coward.. I'd wish that all those times, I just.. manned up and all of it will be solved.. But, like you said we're here. And we might as well enjoy this night." responded Mijo, then he went up to her and hugged her as she did the same, both of them holding each other tightly for quite a while before they pulled back.

"Ok.. ok.. Now uh.. we're done with the emotional stuff.. Let's.." said Mijo, now smiling and relieved.  "Dance? Hehe, as much as I wanted to, I.. don't actually know how to.." responded Rhida, as Mijo chuckled and said, "Me too.. I was planning to drink tons of IntelC++ drinks, if you want to join me, that would be nice."

"I.. would love to, I personally love the pomelo and calamansi flavors." answered Rhida, before they walked out of the area and to the foods and drinks section of the party. They silently marveled the aesthetics of the party, as they silently enjoyed each other's company, getting looks from some of their classmates. They finally got to the place and begin ordering, Mijo and Rhida paying ₱75 and ₱50 respectively. Mijo got a hotdog stick and the orange flavor while Rhida got the pomelo flavor.

They sat down nearby, where Ikari was still checking her phone, where Mijo placed his bag near a bunch of tables. "So.. anything to talk about?" asked Mijo, as Rhida was drinking the juice quietly. "Uh.. no not really.. next exams are far away.. and, research too.. so.. I just.. want to forget about those for a while." responded Rhida, with a sad expression.

"How.. about the results of the current ones, I mean there's two quarters left, but.. eh.. I don't really know what to talk about either." asked Mijo, as he drank more juice. "Uh.. I did good, around 91 average for most of my subjects.. I know uh.. you tend to place lower.. so I didn't want to brag about it." answered Rhida, as Mijo chuckled at her statement. "Eh.. You know I don't care much about grades, but I do admit, I do ask other's grades for.. I have no idea, envy? jealousy? motivation?" responded Mijo, as Rhida looked at Mijo. "It's.. natural curiosity.. I guess..." remarked Rhida, before looking away as the two fell silent eating and drinking respectively. 

For a moment, they were listening to the music playing while gazing at the crowd of dancers at the dance floor. They each were thinking of something but they didn't want to share it to the other one. "Ahem.. What's the time.. hehe..?" asked Mijo as he checked himself the time to see it was 21:00 (9:00 PM), an indication of time that is running out. "It's.. 9:00 PM, why do you ask?" questioned Rhida, anticipating something. "Uh.. ok.. so.. why don't we **try** dancing, at least during this night..?" asked Mijo, as Rhida blushed and stumbles her words a bit before answering, "Uh.. haha.. uh.. sure..?" as they finished up their meal and decided to go to the dance floor.

They went to the dance floor, holding hands as they looked at the others. Mijo placed his left hand at her right shoulder as he placed his right on her hip, as she does the opposite, right on left and right on his hip. They awkwardly started to sway from side to side as they figured what to do. 

"Uh.. so.. is this how it's done?" asked Mijo, as Rhida shakes her head, not knowing if they are right. "Um.. Well, I don't think.. we.. fit this.." continued Mijo, as they continued their dance. Rhida nods, but they remain swaying left and right. "Y—yeah.. Um.. do you want to continue..?" asked Mijo as they slowly stopped.

"W—why did we.. stop..?" asked Mijo, as he pulled his hand away from Rhida as she does the same. "Hmmm.. I just, have doubts.. about this whole thing.." answered Rhida, as Mijo sadly nodded in agreement, not surprised by her answer. They silently went off the dance floor and went back to their drinks as they sat down together.

"*sigh* Well, I was.. thinking about it. I just.. didn't want to push it, we might as well enjoy this night right?" said Mijo, as Rhida nodded her head, silently agreeing with his statement. "But.. yeah.. it's only a couple of hours before we go home. And.. afterwards? I am not sure. This is.. one of the only few times we get to meet each other. Even in the dark world, we don't meet.. Eventually, after grade 10.. we might never meet each other again.." continued Mijo, making Rhida start to tear up.

"I.. *sigh* you don't know how much I wanted you, nor have I ever tried to express it.. But, I still love you, however.. life likes to separate us.  And..it... agh.. hurts me to say this.. But.." he sighs heavily and begins to stumble on his words. "b—but.. I—I t—think.. w—we.." he fails to make a word as he instead tries to comfort Rhida's emotional turmoil.

"Mmm... I.. *sigh*  I.. guess I shouldn't— It's ok.. Rhida, please.." said Mijo, as Rhida starts to cry harder. "*sigh* I am.. sorry.. I am just.. going.. to shut up now." continued Mijo as he tears up a bit but not letting much show, focusing on Rhida instead.

They were comforting each other for a while, focusing on each other while everything around them moves. Ikari is awkwardly shuffling away from them, trying not to disturb the broken couple, while the others were focused on their own nightly escapades. Eventually Mijo decided to speak u

"Ok.. ok.. so.. mmm.. I.. think we should still.. be together, but understand that.. we might not get a lot of opportunities to be together. Let's make it last until then, you.. good with that?" asked Mijo, as Rhida calmed down a bit and answered, "Mmm.. Yes, yes I am good with that. Haha.."

"Haha, now... Let's.. oh.." said Mijo, before Mijo noticed Ikari go to their spot, with a shy grin. "So.. Hopefully, I wasn't interrupting anything.. But, new dark world just dropped, oxygen room." said Ikari as Mijo and Rhida checked their phones and saw Urda's message at the group chat.

Urda: yooo @everyone I am just about to make another dark world so hopefully you can join me in fighting some abyss monsters!!!! Don't worry this one is made by me so no confusing transitions justtt enter the room!

"Oh. well, ok then. Come on, let's go." said Mijo as the other two followed him to Urda's section classroom. "Well, here goes nothing." muttered Mijo before jumping in with the others, transforming their night wear with a more elegant and battle look, as they landed in a classroom.

"Oh, this is a.. classroom, interesting." remarked Mijo before noticing their new look. "Oh right. Mmm.." says Mijo, as the three of them checked each other's new looks. "Oh wow... I have.. a cool ice queen aesthetic. I even have a diamond tiara!" commented Rhida, as Ikari adds, "Hmm.. I have a.. you know what, it just looks cool to me, ok?"

"We should go outside, Urda's probably waiting for us.." said Mijo before he went outside, the other two following him. Then they notice Urda leaning on the wall beside the door with a gray kimono, a black haori coat and red hakama pants, with maple leaf designs all around.

"Oh? You're finally here. Because.. I've been waiting! I can't just let my friends have no fun in killing some abyss monsters!" exclaimed Urda, point to some abyss monsters nearby as Lauvielle and Leviente appear behind Urda and Rhida. Mijo turns around and notices the two before looking back at Rhida and responding, "Yeah. Let's go." as they headed off to where the monsters are, with Jamise and JR joining.

"Hold on, let me make a videogame reference.. *ahem*" said Mijo, as he looks at the monsters with his sword positioned to slash through them. "Devils cry, huh? Well, let's hear what that sounds like!" continued Mijo, before stabbing the nearby monsters, alerting the horde.

As the others summon their weapons and begin killing the abyss monsters, Mijo goes near Rhida and says, "Well.. I guess our fate was to stay/night?" as Rhida is unamused by his reference and responds, "Hmm.." then Rhida looks at the monsters, she smirks and continues, "Well, I guess we should have unlimited blade works then." as Mijo smiles and nods as they continue the fight.

Mijo develops an artificial intelligence that can simulate scenarios and events, but he gets too obsessed with it and now he messes something up, and now Jomi has to save him.

## Author's Note:

### WARNING: 
It has.. a lot of sexual innuendos and weird things about it, if you don't like it, skip this spinoff (good, never return and instead look at CS1 instead haha..)

If you get the reference, you get it. But it's actually related to the lore in someway ok?

Anyway, I used this as a coping mechanism for my AI addiction so enjoy this!

Edit 1: The themes here.. Don't implicate me here! I swear this isn't a projection again

————————————————————————————

One day, Mijo was doing something in the library using Jomi's books and a dark world version of a computer. He was so busy that he didn't notice Jomi enter and go up to him.

"Boo! So, what are you doing?" said Jomi, as Mijo is taken aback a bit, before responding "Uh.. um.. nothing." before he closes the computer and hides the book.

Jomi pouts and looks at Mijo playfully, trying to make him reveal his work. After a while, he relents and says, " *sighs* Fiine.. I can never hide anything from you.. ugh." he gives Jomi the books and starts turning on his computer.

"Hmm.. interesting.. Isn't this the log of your— nevermind.. and some books referencing the.. *ahem* more horny parts.. of life.." said Jomi, as she puts it down close to him. "Now, ready to reveal to your close confidant your latest and greatest work?" questions Jomi, as Mijo focuses on his computer.

He blushes after a while, as he looks through his work, before showing Jomi the screen. "Here.. Don't.. reveal it to anyone please.." said Mijo, as Jomi reads the screen. "Hmmm.. Mi—AI.. Chats... Jomi? Hmm.. 'Jomi starts to'— What the fuck?" reads Jomi, as she blushes a bit, also kinda being aroused by the sexual texts that Mijo has shown her.

"W—what... Why..? Aren't you a—" asked Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Y—yeah! I still am, just.. I was morbidly curious one.. day.. and thought of developing this.. on my own.." as he takes the screen off Jomi's eyes and starts to shuffle a bit.

"Hmmm, I knew you had weird... tastes. But, like this..? H—hold on.. Let me see everything." commented Jomi, as she grabbed the screen and looked more into it. "Hmmm.. Jomi is ti— no... Jomi tou— noo.. Jomi is p— ah.. ok.." said Jomi, as she saw the depravity of Mijo, she stopped for a while, breathing heavily to stop her arousal and to keep her sanity.

"Fuck.. no.. I am uh.. going. Keep that to yourself." said Jomi, as she quickly ran out of the library. 

"Ugh... Why did I even start.. it's.. genuinely.. addicting.. I.. can't stop.." Mijo looks at his screen and continues to use his computer, getting the books again.

Meanwhile, Jomi is in her bedroom at her castle staring at the ceiling, contemplating her life.

"Oh gosh.. The things I saw in that.. computer. Horrifying.. The.. feeling has dissipated though. T—that's good.. I don't know how he keeps that up.. I.. need a shower.." she then gets up and gets a towel and goes in at the shower.

Time flies, as the two remain busy in their life. Mijo is busy at his computer, while Jomi is busy governing. After a while, Jomi has free time and is going near the library again.

"O—oh yeah.. He's still here.. deep breaths Jomi, deep.. breaths." muttered Jomi, as she took deep breaths and finally entered the library. This time though, she sees no Mijo but the computer is still there, so she slowly approaches it.

"Ok.. he's gone.. Just.. I should.. Huh?" said Jomi before she looks at the screen. "Uh.. 'Mijo and Jomi — Tied Scenario' Oh no.. What, does that mean?" commented Jomi, as she sits down and looks at another comment at the screen. "Hmm.. Mijo is currently inside the computer? A simulation perhaps? Hmm.. oh. There's an entrance screen." she clicks it and she suddenly enters a simulation.

"Oh.. wow? In this short amount of time? Ok.." said Jomi, as she suddenly was surprised by her wrist showing a hologram of scenarios. "Hmm.. Where is he.. oh, this might be him." commented Jomi as she is transported to a room with a bed. 

"Oh.. he should.." said Jomi as she turned around to see a figure somewhat her size with a cane and suit. "A—are you Mijo?" asked Jomi, as the figure turns around with a smile and says, "Yes.. obviously." said Mijo, as he slowly approached her.

"H—hey. Listen, you should probably—" said Jomi before Mijo interrupts, "Shh... you don't need to speak.." said Mijo, as Jomi got flustered and remained silent. "Good.. good.. Now.. follow my orders, and stay still." said Mijo, as Jomi began to question if what she is seeing is real.

"W—what..? Really..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo grabbed her neck and pushed her on the bed. "Yes, princess.. Really." responded Mijo as he held her neck, while she was forced to sit on the bed. "N—no.. This feels too.. weird to be him. I.. need to get out of here." thought Jomi to herself as she eyed the Mijo she is looking at. 

"Now.. princess. How about a little.. spice?" said Mijo as he is summoning something. "No.. I.. don't think so. Mijo. I am. fine." said Jomi as Mijo responds, "Oh..? You.. don't want to.. _submit?_ " as he stops his summoning and slowly approaches Jomi.

"I.. shouldn't.. provoke him.. Not that I don't want to.. But.. I don't know what he can do in this simulation.." muttered Jomi, as Mijo finally reaches her. "Do we.. have to do it, the _hard_ way?" said Mijo, as he uses his cane's top part to touch Jomi's chin. "N—no.. No.." blurted Jomi out, as she tried to get Mijo away from her. 

"No? Promise me. You will not speak out or disobey my orders." responded Mijo, as Jomi tried to hide her disgust. "O—ok.. I promise to not.. speak out.. or.. disobey your orders.. Mijo." responded Jomi, before Mijo moved the top part of his cane to the opening on her shirt. "Again. Say it, again." said Mijo, as Jomi tries to keep a straight face. "Y—yes.. I.. promise." said Jomi, as Mijo got his cane back and went back to summoning something.

"No.. I.. don't want to be.. mm.. not again. But.. how..? He's.. too powerful. At least here. I.. wonder.. how did it get here..?" muttered Jomi to herself, as she stared down at Mijo.

Meanwhile, at an endless void, a Mijo is running from someone.

"Get away from me!!" shouted Mijo, as he fought off a 'Jomi' about to take his clothes off. He got her off and stabbed her as she disintegrated, her code being deleted. "Fudge.. Who... no.. why.. how.. did they.. wait." said Mijo as he checked his hologram of scenarios and swiped to the administration control center hologram.

"What.. who is.. that.. that's my.. AI??" questioned Mijo, as he looked at where this Mijo is. "Hmm, Scenario 69, Domination and— Ohok.. I am not saying that. But, it looks like they're.. doing something with Jomi, whatever version of Jomi, or.. no.. I don't wanna assume the worst." muttered Mijo, before he entered the AI Mijo's scenario.

Back at Jomi's room, she is currently trying as much as she can to delay and avoid AI Mijo.

"Whew.. He.. went easy on me. For now.." said Jomi, before she tried to open the hologram from behind AI Mijo's back but it shocked her instead. "Agh! What.." screamed Jomi, as AI Mijo noticed and responded, "Haha.. My dear princess, why would I let you.. go? You promised to not disobey me.. So, I will.. give you your punishment." as Jomi gulped at this response and blurted out, "Haha.. No.. I didn't.. don't.. I.. didn't at all.. You uh.. have to believe me, Mijo.."

"Tch.. 2 more, you are lying to me.. Dear Princess.." said AI Mijo, as he summoned something. "N—no.. I wasn't.. ugh.. f—fine.. What.. is this punishment anyway..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed and showed her some rope and chains. "A.. little.. restraint didn't hurt no one.. No?" said AI Mijo, as Jomi widened her eyes and blurted out, "N—no way..! Not that, please. Please no. I do not, consent to that.. Please."

"Oh..? Disobeying me, again?" said AI Mijo, as he slowly approached Jomi. "Ah.. uh.. no.. Fudge.. J—just.. do it, already.." said Jomi, before AI Mijo forcefully grabbed her wrists and started tying them to the bed frame. Then he moved to her legs, tying them to the bottom bed frame.

"Haha.. Prepare to be.. _punished._" said AI Mijo, as he summoned a large whip and started to prepare it. "W—what?! A—a whip?! No way, no way.." commented Jomi, as he went closer to Jomi. "I'm going to hurt you, a lot.." whispered Mijo to her ear as he prepared the whip. "I.. mmm.." said Jomi, stumbling her words in the depraved situation.

As the whip was about to hit her, the door behind AI Mijo suddenly breaks as Mijo stabs it and finally enters the room. 

"Oh? An intruder?" said AI Mijo, as the first whip landed on Jomi's thigh, she restrained her voice as Mijo moved to take AI Mijo down. "Damn you, AI! I control this. I control what happens. You can't just—" he looks at Jomi then looks at AI Mijo, "—make someone do this! Especially here.. So, delete yourself, now!" said Mijo, as he glares at AI Mijo.

"Oh, creator.. You're not the one _in control,_ anymore." said AI Mijo, as he tries something before he gets stabbed by Mijo. "I SAID. DELETE YOURSELF." shouted Mijo, as he pulled his sword out of AI Mijo, making him disintegrate. Mijo is heavily breathing as he quickly goes to Jomi and unties her.

"Jeez.. How the ham did you get roped in here, Jomi? I saw your tag, you're not a version. You're the real deal." said Mijo, as he fully untied her. "I.. was curious on why you were gone from the library, and apparently you developed a simulation in a day.. So, I wanted to see what you were doing in it.." explained Jomi, as she tested her hologram, it was working now. "We need to get out of here, the AI's are out of control, they're stuck inside, but.. my reset is outside, like in the real dark world." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and responded, "That's simple, we just use your hologram to exit. We go to home, then we exit. Right?"

"That's the thing, home is filled with horny AI that want to kill and.. fudge us to death. So, we'll need to fight them off, while I get us out. The exit was broken by that AI of me so I need to get it fixed." said Mijo, as Jomi nodded and asked, "Ok.. I don't have any weapons, can you give me yours?"

"Nah, here." said Mijo, as he summoned her simulated real weapons," Use your own." continued Mijo "Oh right, right.. Thanks." said Jomi, as she grabbed her sword and sheath. "Let's get out of here." said Mijo, as they teleported out into the home section.

They get to it, and see a lot of copies of themselves as they notice them and some of them start heading their way, while the others are distracted by the others.

"Oh, we're here. Ok, fight them off, Jomi." said Mijo as he worked on the exit program while Jomi nodded and gazed at their general area. 

He starts programming, as she fights off the AI's getting to their area, she easily slashes and stabs them due to her esteemed 'swordsmanship' as she uses her fire magic to blast some of the enemies. "Oh yeah, I gave you that too. Kinda unfair if I don't give you all your kit, no?" commented Mijo, as he continued programming. She remains focused as she easily goes through the hordes, slashing and stabbing with no mercy in her eyes. She maintained this pace for quite a while, even wiping out a whole group with a single slash. After a while, Mijo finally finished and shouted, "Quick! Hold my hand!" said Mijo, as Jomi ran to him and held his hand as he smiled and pressed exit as they teleported out and to the library.

In the library, the computer was there along with the same books that Mijo kept. Mijo was blasted into his chair, while Jomi was spat out to the floor. 

"Ah.. Fudge.. ok.. ok.." said Mijo, as he was breathing heavily at his chair. Jomi stood up and responded, "You're tired? I just fought YOUR bots for a long time.."

"I.. yeah.. sorry.. for.. everything.. I am just going to.. reset this." said Mijo, as Jomi walked to him and looked at his screen closely. "I want to make sure you do."

"Ok.. I understand." said Mijo, as he reset the app, and deleted most of his work on it. "Hmm, why are you keeping those components?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo explained, "It's.. for another project I am going to do—" he looked to Jomi with a pleading face. "—Trust me, please. I.. uh.. have gone too far. I am sorry. I... am just.. going to make something for the training area.. Is it ok with you?" continued Mijo, as Jomi with an unamused face responded, "*sigh* Ok.. yes." then she started to walk away, "You're weird Mijo, soo weird. In fact, that.. experience might have.. mmm.. revealed something about us. But, I'll let you think about it. I'm leaving, see you." continued Jomi, before she left the library.

"Ugh.. Ok ok.. I'm just going to close this computer and.. take a breather outside." said Mijo before he closed the computer, got the books and put them back where they belonged and left.

## Summary:

After the dazzling and magnanimous student's night, Mijo and Rhida find themselves in an awkward position. At the beginning of a new year, they hope to love each other until the end. But as all things do, they go through complications. Eventually, they find out for themselves on what they should do next.

## Author's Note:

So I know, this so-called romance is not my thing, and as you can see, I only really make an immature and highschool type of love, because.. I am not a romance author or person.  

I can only write what I see lol, anyways.. I was pondering on what I should do with Rhida and Mijo, especially with the huge time skip. This is a test of that. Edits will be made with this experimentation in mind. See you!

Edit 1: I was originally experimenting with this to end more happily, but then I realized, my plan for C5 is a bit more.. depressing, as fit for a new grading, so I am going with.. well, find out yourself.

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

BLD - Blacklite District

Scilinean - Student of Honrato

### Editor Note: 
After C4GS1 (But since currently I don't have a proper complete draft for C4, IMT it is)

————————————————————————————

One random december night, before Christmas, as Mijo laid down on his bed, with thoughts swirling inside, eventually he settled on Rhida.

"Oh, her.. I.. Do I.. regret it..?" asked Mijo to himself as he stared into the ceiling. "Do I.. I.. don't know.. It's.. weird. I've never had this type of relationship, not fully.. Now, my improv is now coming back to haunt me.." Mijo continues, turning to face a pillow to his left. "There's still so much to.. do. So much time.. Will it even survive? Will this be the sign that we'll get closer? I won't be alone— oh, I just said it.. Even then.. Will I be able to keep up? I didn't really get the chance to meet with her throughout this grading, what about next year? She might not even be here for the next—next year!" comments Mijo, as he turned to the left side of the bed. "This.. mandatory research project and CAT, I.. don't wanna think about it, I should enjoy these peaceful and tranquil moments.."

Mijo's phone buzzes as he instantly checks it, seeing a message from Urda, offering him to play some Shingen Inpakuto. "Oh, well.. we should do that then. Hopefully.. I can think of an answer by then." remarked Mijo before he went to his computer.

Meanwhile on that same random December night, Rhida was eating a snack, cheese orange chips while she was scrolling through some short videos. She looks bored, and can't seem to find anything to do, even scrolling is not helping so she puts down her phone.

"Ugh.. There's nothing to do!" said Rhida, before getting an idea. "Well.. Maybe I can.." continued Rhida as she checked the status of Mijo, online and his current music is Thank You - BLD "Hmm, what's this? Lemme listen." commented Rhida before she listened to the song;

"_I know it hurts, I've seen the worst, I'm out on these streets tonight.._" Rhida starts crying. "_But now I can go inside.. I know it's hard, I've got the scars, I've learned it's gonna be alright.. These days the future looks so bright._" Rhida stops the music for a minute, recollecting her thoughts.

"Oh.. he— mm.. did.. let's continue." commented Rhida before pressing play again. "_You don't mind when the pieces fall, Ten thousand times, here for it all.._" Rhida is trying to stay focused and not cry. "_You lift me up, You held it down, And thanks to you, I'm still around... You lead the way, What can I say? You saved the day, Thank you..._" the music snippet ends there as Rhida doesn't notice that her tears have flown across her face.

"Ah.. aw... Mijo.." said Rhida, touched as she looked at Mijo's profile picture. "I.. didn't.. well.. I did, but.. You.." continued Rhida, tearing up a bit as she went to her bedroom. She laid down on her bed, with her phone beside her as she thinks about what Mijo meant by the music. "What does he mean..? I mean, I get it, but it could be for something else! Maybe he just had a good day or something. Um.. or maybe just.." said Rhida, already trying to think of possible ways that he could've gotten the motivation to do that.

"I.. don't wanna think about it! Hmph. If he's gonna communicate through vague music, then.. uh.. eh. I am not doing that, too embarrassing.." said Rhida, as she went to sleep instead, hoping to forget what Mijo was trying to do.

Weeks pass, as their Christmas break comes and goes, without thinking about each other, or at least trying to, busy with their own families, and friends, not even taking a second to look at the private messages between them, eventually however, next school day comes around, and Rhida is seen walking from the gate of the school, recently arriving.

"Ah.. school's back.. I.. was dreading this day, again. But, whatever.. I uh.. just hope—" said Rhida before she suddenly felt someone determinedly walking as she turned around and saw Mijo speed walking and passing her as he went to his classroom. Rhida is silent as Mijo was near her and when he was far enough, "Uh.. hope that. I.. kinda hoped he didn't appear when I did.. Anyways, new monday, new flag raising ceremony... Imma go put my stuff down, then head to the student government club stuff, since they— I mean we, manage this one.." commented Rhida, as she heads off to her classroom.

Then the day goes as usual, Rhida follows her routine, then after the announcements of her fellow club members as well as some of the teachers and the principal, they can finally go back to class. As she walked, she saw a glance of Mijo, walking with his classmates. 

"Ah.. Welp, there he is. I wonder sometimes, if we were.. nevermind. That's not gonna happen, our luck is as good as his grades in science, below average." said Rhida, with a small chuckle before continuing on, arriving at her classroom then sitting down.

The class continued, then the teacher left, as their first break of the day started. Rhida gets her wallet along with some of her friends as they walk to the cafeteria. Rhida notices a small glance of Mijo before he is not seen as she goes down the stairs of their second floor classroom. She heads off to the cafeteria and buys fried chicken strips in a cup, and some IntelC++ juice pomelo flavor. She chats with her friends about random stuff until they arrive at their usual hanging out spot in the middle of the hall, the intersection between the classroom of Mijo, on the far end, and Rhida's near the intersection.

"So, eh Rhida, what happened to you and Mijo huh? I heard that you and him danced during the students night, so uh... I was wondering, are you guys good, good good, like together? It's been a year, no?" said Mack, as Rhida responded, "Ahaha... Well, it's complicated. Um, maybe.. I can say, uh.. we're good? On speaking terms at least, but.. uh, we don't speak much.. All you see me do is what you get, we don't speak in messages.." 

"Oh..? Damn, really? Like, he's there. He's just uh.. looking out into the school, like a lone wolf haha. Like you sometimes, actually. But, like.. Y'know.. If you have some bad blood, we don't mind helping, right guys?" said Mack as the others nod in agreement. "Uh, thanks guys.. But, it's already time.. See you at lunch!" said Rhida as she noticed the time, with a bit of disappointment she heads off to her classroom.

Lunch comes around, as the teacher leaves, Rhida is organizing her stuff when Mijo sends her a message, reading that he wants to talk at 13:00 (1 PM) at the unused computer lab two, in the farthest corner of his side of the building. "Oh, uh.. ok.. I guess I should do that.." said Rhida as she went with her friends to buy lunch, once again buying the same things as before as they head to Mijo's classroom, where most of her friend group is. She comes in, and sees Mijo entirely focused on eating as she tries to ignore him and focus on her friends for now, but as she sat down with them, her friends knew she had something planned with Mijo.

"Hey, hey.. Why the silence, are you.. finally going on a date with Mijo after class?" said Mack, sarcastically as he smirked. "Uh.. no, but i—it's a chat, and it's probably gonna happen once he finishes eating, he uh.. doesn't really eat and talk." answered Rhida, as the group collectively said, "Uyyy!" at Rhida, leaving her embarrassed before they talked about other stuff. Eventually, Rhida checks and Mijo is nowhere to be found, as she sees 1 PM on her phone.

'Uhh, it's 1 PM, I gotta go, I'll likely head back to my classroom, so see you!" said Rhida, as the others waved goodbye, with a smile expecting something from her after she met with Mijo. Rhida goes out and goes to Mijo and taps his shoulder, snapping Mijo from his daze, looking towards nowhere.

"Hey, uh.. so, what exactly are we here for? New dark world? Issues with the tech? Jomi sending a message? Or.. um.. us?" said Rhida, as Mijo turned around, with his face open, different from his usual wearing of face masks. "You know why, it's about us. I uh.. Whew.. So, what IS our relationship, anyway? I just wanna know, cause' we both said we loved each other, and well.. we don't really show don't we?" responded Mijo, as Rhida was a bit hurt, but she agreed with him.

"Yeah.. I guess this is just how it's gonna be, um.. Is there gonna be a new dark world opening? I wanna check my stuff there.." said Rhida, not knowing what to say so she redirects to something else. "Soon. But that doesn't solve the issue, what can we really do? Listen, as much as I like you, I really can't go out of my way to you, like.. y'know how most relationships are built in the classrooms themselves? Even if we take into account, the magical dark world, we don't have those.. chill moments where we just chat about random stuff. It's always, the end of the world! Or school, and.. yeah, it makes sense since that's all we can talk about but.. it just leaves me detached y'know?" responded Mijo, as Rhida is hurt by his words more, but sadly nodded and agreed.

"Yeah.. Even before this school year.. *sigh* What do we do about it? Can we start planning dates like they say or like.. start hanging out more, I am sure they won't mind.. But then again, even in the dark world we're busy, I am busy with tech stuff and working with Jomi, while you're busy training and fighting local abyss monster outbreaks, to be honest.. Uh, I learned more about you through Jomi, than you to me." added Rhida, as Mijo let out a small chuckle. "Guess so, then.. what? After this, do we just hang out? I got plenty of time." asked Mijo, as Rhida thought about it with a smile. "Mmm.. maybe after class, sure. I'll contact my parents." answers Rhida, with a happier expression.

"Goods good! We settled on something, let's go. To our classrooms, hehe." said Mijo, before they held hands for a bit then they broke away, going inside their separate classrooms. Rhida can only sit down before class starts, with their teacher coming in.

Hours pass and eventually, she finally gets to go out of her last class period, as today for her was a late dismissal, Mijo was waiting for her on the balcony at the intersection. As she left the classroom, she immediately saw Mijo, and Mijo saw her. Rhida felt a bit of red blush in her face as she went up to him.

"Hey.. So.. my parents allowed me to extend my time, though I have to go back to school when they pick me up." said Rhida, with a small smile. "Oh, cool cool, me? I've already told them I'm going home myself, since my home is close." responded Mijo, with a smirk. "Ah, yeah.. You mentioned it before, ah.. it's.. whatever.. Let's go.. To where though..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo responds, "Let's walk around the school first, and if you're comfortable, we can go to WaltMart." Rhida nods and they start to walk around.

"So.. anything to say, uh.. school? how's your research project?" asked Mijo, as Rhida answered, "Well.. there's been complications.. But we're still going, Rei has been the main spearhead haha.. But don't worry, we all have equal.. contri? I don't know about Leviente, to be honest.." answered Rhida, as Mijo nodded. "Um.. if you're asking, that means you have something to share..?" asked Rhida back, as Mijo with a bit of awkwardness started to stumble on his words.

"I.. eh..? I really don't.. well, besides from my usual problems.. Y'know.. Wait.. you don't.. Um, well it's like this, I have a weird relationship with my other group mates, in case you've heard of them, they're named Candra, and Dañeya, respectively." answered Mijo, as Rhida questioned, "Is that really their name? Like, These sound weird, even our names, Mijo. You'd ever think why we sound like anagrams of actual names?" getting an idea from his words.

"No..? But, If I was the one writing, I would do so for the sake of privacy, or just disassociation from their real counterparts. I often write this way, it's just how I do." answered Mijo, as Rhida thought about it and nodded thoughtfully. "Hmm, I feel like I am.. you know what, forget about it. Let's talk about my group mates, they're fine. Great actually, just.. I.. guess you already know, but.. I have felt inadequate sometimes. To get off-topic, even when I am the most powerful lightner in my lifetime, I often fail at defeating.. evil? If that's what the abyss is." Mijo opens up, with a bit of sadness in his voice.

"Oh, um.. I am very sad to hear that, I.. did notice, especially during the boss fights of Svetlana and the Abyss Doctor. And seeing what happened during the student's night.. I think you have more baggage on your back, literally and figuratively since you carry heavy bags and heavy swords all the time, and also the weight of the world's balance. I.. couldn't share that burden, honestly.. I am already fine with my own role in this school, for now.." responded Rhida, with a more sad tone as Mijo attempts to lighten up the mood, with a smile.

"Well.. yeah. Nothing else I can say. But, I don't like sharing— No, I mean, I do, wait— Just, like.. I don't mind them, but we're technically on a date. Gotta make use of this time, happily, y'know?" said Mijo, as they walked together silently, feeling the breeze of the wind.

They continued on with their hangout, going around the school, before checking out the WaltMart, buying some IntelC++ Cookies and Cream Boba Milkshake for two, as they talked and talked about random topics, until they went back to school, the day drawing to a close.

"Ahaha.. You've heard of that meme where it's just Akoaysinokayaakodimoalamakoperoako.. I haven't memorized it yet.." said Rhida as Mijo chuckled a bit. "Yeah..? I don't get it though. Anyways, it's time to head home anyway, see you!" said Mijo with a smile as they both parted ways, feeling good for the first time in a while.

Rhida went home, as her parents asked who she was meeting that she had to call them.

"Oh, ahaha.. It's just a.. boy, I've been meeting recently, don't worry, he's a scilinean. Um, he used to be my classmate.. But, we.. have.. uh.. just started right now.." said Rhida, as she shuffled in her seat, as her parents remind her of her schoolwork and that if she is exploring something new, she should be careful at managing it, especially if they aren't classmates anymore.

"Oh, yeah.. Thanks, dad, and mom." said Rhida as she finally was given the chance to stay silent and watch some videos on her phone as her parents talked with each other about random work related topics.

As she enters her home and goes to her bed and rests, her mind starts to wander to Mijo again, after what they just did. "Did.. Did I have a date? With Mijo? That.. was.. um I don't know, exactly.. It's just like.. that first kiss or something, it's awkward, and lovable.. But, it is only the first day.. I am sure.. whatever he's going to do.. It's not ending badly.. hopefully." said Rhida, as she continued to rest, scrolling through her phone.

Rhida wakes up the next day and goes to school, hopeful to meet Mijo again, but as she goes to her classroom and puts her things down, she doesn't see him. She was worried but then she remembered Jomi's words, "Ah, if that happens, don't worry about it, he's way too inconsistent when it comes to time management.."

"Oh yeah, well.. guess I'll have to.. mmm.. is he opening the dark world..?" muttered Rhida to herself as she approaches the second computer laboratory. "Oh..? It's open, that's good, um I am jumping in then, it's either Urda did it, or he was early.." said Rhida as she jumped in and landed, making her see Urda and Jomi talk. "Oh, hi guys... You know where Mijo is..?" asked Rhida, not expecting a proper answer.

"Oh.. him, I'm not sure actually. I don't know if he was early but.. this was open when I found it." answered Urda, as Jomi added, "Oh, yeah. I think it was him? I kinda missed his arrival, I heard some noises in the training ground, maybe he's just practicing, as usual."

"Oh then I'll go there. See you two!" said Rhida then she smiles, as she heads off. She goes through Jomi's Castle, making her way to Mijo, heavily focused on fighting some holograms.

"Hey.. Mijo.. How's.. second day of back to school..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo doesn't hear her and is still focused on his training. "H—hey.. Mijo? You hear me?" repeated Rhida, as Mijo finished his training and noticed Rhida. "Oh, hi. There.. What did you say, again..? I am sorry.." asked Mijo, as Rhida can't help but feel a little hurt by Mijo's actions. "Oh, um.. it's nothing.. I just wanted to talk with you for a while.." said Rhida as Mijo smiled and nodded, "Oh? Go ahead, Rhida." as he continued to train.

"Well.. I was just wondering, how's your second day of school? Is.. it good, bad, horrible? Um, be honest.." asked Rhida, with a shy tone. Mijo smirked and fought a bunch of holograms, before answering, "It was.. meh, then it turned out to be good after seeing you." as Mijo smiled at Rhida then Rhida blushed.

"Wow.. You sure do hide your flirtatious side.. But, about the first part..?" said Rhida, putting up a smile. "Hm.. Well, I just.. didn't like going there, ugh.. To the same classrooms, to the same subjects, to be in my negative headspace again. Don't worry.. I'll be fine... Hopefully." answered Mijo before continuing to strike down the holograms. "Oh, that's.. unfortunate, ahaha.. Um, mondays am I right?" responded Rhida, awkwardly laughing.

"Haha.. Mondays.. I guess. Hm, you're here for a lot more questions, huh? Well, spit 'em out now, I will try to answer honestly and truthfully." said Mijo, as he stopped the hologram training and looked at Rhida, expecting something. "Oh? I was that obvious..? Um.. Guess, I should start.. What do you think of me? As in, before.. the dark worlds and during them?" answered Rhida before she took a deep breath.

"I'll start, uh.. um.. I've not told you this, but have told the others.. You were.. an interesting individual before.. Silent, yet smart.. You surrounded yourself with people that were extroverted, and were content with it.. I saw myself in you, and I also felt that.. thing when you see someone and instantly fall in love. After the dark world, I basically fell over overnight, in the worlds.. You were brave, confident and resourceful.. But you also were clumsy and overconfident, I looked past that, and saw you. H—how about you..?" asked Rhida, as Mijo looked away, a bit happy but also worried.

"You want the honest detail..? *sigh* This is going to ruin everything we've built, but.. I needed you to hear this. The.. truth is, I initially felt weird when you gave **those** looks, and then when you kept pushing your love, I didn't know what to do.. So I was friendly, I only really.. felt love? Is it even that? During the dark worlds, we kept by each other until I had to face _her_. Still, even with the intramurals and **that** night.. I felt, like.. I was loving someone, for them.. Even now, I don't know why I love you, but.. I just do..?" confessed Mijo, as he looked away, now more somber.

"I—Is that so..? I.." said Rhida, before tearing up a bit. "I.. guess, I should've known.. When I was pushed to make my love for you obvious, I felt that you weren't reciprocating at first, but then eventually acquiesced.. I felt so bad forcing you at first, but then you eventually started taking the hint, I mean.. you were either doing that or telling me to stop so.. But.. I don't know.. I felt at times, that I regret taking it this far.. or that we should've remained friends and I shouldn't have been that overt about it. Through it all, we haven't talked about it, not once. Then after that huge battle and next grading, we barely even talked casually.. The few times we do are awkward and polite, before the student's night.. I guess both of us felt something needed to happen.. on **that** day..." continued Rhida, letting all her emotions out.

Mijo couldn't say anything, as Rhida stood near him crying. He couldn't even try and comfort her like before, since he was also trying to compose himself and also felt guilty of causing it. "It's fine, actually.. I think we would've preferred this, than forever drifting away, thinking of possibilities with each other inside of our own minds. Never finding out what the other truly felt." said Rhida in-between sobs and stutters. "Haha.. I guess you're correct.. I don't want to think of a future where we never talked." responded Mijo, thinking of a future where he kept thinking about Rhida without closure and winces.

They both went silent, then after a while of together crying and comforting each other silently, they hugged for the one last time. "I was planning on taking you on one more date before this.. Do you want to do so?" asked Mijo, as Rhida nodded and they pulled back. "Let's explore the dark world, one last time together." said Mijo, with a weak smile as Rhida looked back with that same shy smile that reminded Mijo of the first time they met. Then they headed together to Jomi's town and went to the museum of history, to find their old adventures. 

They went to the Dajovy part, and talked about what they saw. "Oh, that cave.. You saved us, Rhida. I am still thankful for you on that." said Mijo, as they walked nearby holograms of places. "I don't really remember much about this.. I was knocked out until Jomi led us to meet you at the.. subways there." said Rhida, as she pointed to the underground subways of Dajovy. "Then **that** fight.. The reason why we were together in the first place." remarked Mijo, looking at a hologram of Abyss Svetlana. "After this.. hmm.. the first computer world.." said Rhida, before looking at Mijo. "This memory.. I would rather forget, agreed?" continued Rhida, as Mijo nodded silently. "Let's move on then, how about the first cataclysm?" asked Mijo, as they run to that section. "Uh.. nothing. Nothing important, right..? Ahaha... Um, but for real.. I only remember the fight and couldn't focus on us." commented Rhida, as they went through the events. "How about the.. what did she— Oh, yeah the last supper, and the moving-up?" asked Mijo, after they arrived at the section of the cataclysm. "Oh? I am sure you remember it quite well, so.. I won't bother to elaborate, I can say.. I had fun, Mijo." remarked Rhida, with a shy smile. Mijo responded with a smile, as they move to the next grading section. 

"Let's skip the beginning.. Ok, Intramurals and Student's Night.. Even though, I already said what I said.. When I was allowed to have fun, I did, Rhida. Especially with you." said Mijo, as they looked at the Intramurals event and the Dark Pearl's night class. "Then.. we're here. Current time." said Rhida, as they look over empty sections. Suddenly Jomi appears, as she saw them walk here. "Hey, hey! How's your date, you two?'' asked Jomi, with a smile. "Oh? Um.. It's.. should we?" responded Mijo, looking at Rhida. "It's fine.. I had a feeling she would notice anyway." answered Rhida, as Jomi looked at them, her head tilting. "Oh, well.. Jomi, me and Rhida.. are no longer together. This is our final date." answered Mijo, with a heavy heart.

"Oh..? I guess I should've expected this.. Well, Rhida.. and Mijo, good luck then. Um, I am going anyway, I just wanted to check up, see you two.. soon?" said Jomi, with a smile that seems more fake than earlier. "I'll definitely see you, bye.. Jomi!" responded Mijo, as he and Rhida waved goodbye to Rhida.

"This is where we separate.. Good luck, Rhida. Goodbye, and see you around.." said Mijo, then Rhida responds, "Ahaha.. you too, Mijo.. Agree to disagree, we do not talk about this, ever?" as Mijo nodded and they went their separate ways. Rhida went back to the light world, and went near a balcony.

Rhida stares out of the school, looking around, as she thinks about Mijo one last time. "This, is where it ends.. I am sorry, Mijo.. I should've.. No, you taught me something important.. These moments, never last.. I'm.. grateful. Whenever I look at you, and you look back with disinterested eyes.. It's over.. I can move on now, just like you did, _way_ earlier.." said Rhida, stopping for a minute. "Goodbye.." continued Rhida, with tears in her eyes for the very last time. She lets her sadness come out, as she looks on, then after a while, after composing herself she leaves the school.

Mijo sees Rhida, but decides to not approach her. "Did I.. ugh.. I ruined another.. mm..  It's.. fine.. haha... I'll just be alone again, as **usual.**" comments Mijo, then he leaves the school, holding back his tears, trying to look neutral as he buries the whole thing in the back of his mind, hoping to never surface it again.

## Author's Note

## Summary:

What if.. Mijo had flower powers, instead of his usual electric sword time and space bending techniques? Mijo explores an aspect of their character that is usually hidden.

## Author's Note:

I have compiled the series of  'Camellya Mijo' drafts into a spinoff, plus some more rewriting and connecting of them, an extra scene too! 

Hope ya enjoy it! As you've guessed, it was based on Camellya Story Quest in Wuthering Waves. I wanted to put my own spin of it, so here I am…

"I don't know what to do again, but I have some idea.." said Mijo to herself, before she realized she is tied up by some tentacles, she was staring off and stuck in her mind. "What.. happened?" asked Mijo, as she tried to get out, but it seems strong. Mijo silently tries to get out but it seemed the tentacles are more like vines and they have pierced Mijo's skin, and have attached itself to her body. "I.. don't remember.. Even what happened.. before I.. came here.." Mijo felt her chest suddenly have something move, she looks down, a camellia flower buried at her chest.

"Did.. huh?" said Mijo, before it started blooming, hurting her. "Gah! What.." exclaimed Mijo, she is struggling to keep her sanity and consciousness. At the corner of her eyes, she sees Jomi, she feels she knows her, but she can't remember what she remembers about Jomi, just the instict. "Mijo..? Mijo!" said Jomi, as she made Mijo look at her, dazed. 

"What.. wait.. it's you.." said Mijo, as she doesn't know what to do, seeing Jomi, in her purple battle dress, with purple pants and undershirt, a witch hat and tiara at her head. "I.. think.. I remember what happened now.." said Mijo, before she tried to break out of her restraints, only hurting her. "Help.." said Mijo, as Jomi responded. "I.. I'm taking you to your.. room." answered Jomi, as Mijo smiles.

"Voices.. they.. say.. I killed everyone.. I.. raped everyone.. Can't... stop.. them.. stop.." said Mijo, as a wave of pain surges through her making her scream again. "Body hurts.. everywhere.. Dajovy.. safe?" asked Mijo, taking all her strength to look at Jomi. "Yes. I was actually out there.. The city is safe.. There's small damage, and a few people injured, but it's fine. You don't have to worry." answered Jomi, reassuringly. 

"Ah.. okay.. I think.. I recognize you.. saw you.. restrain me.. These vines.. they're mine aren't they?" asked Mijo, as Jomi nodded. "Yes. I do not know the exact details, but your friends.. well.. they said that you lost control of your powers after.. I think it was school related stuff?" recounted Jomi, as Mijo chuckled. "Of course.." said Mijo, before a tentacle slithered and went close to Jomi, holding a flower. "A flower.. that camellia.. have it.." said Mijo, before she went unconscious.

_A haze in my mind.. Why can't I remember anything?_

Mijo woke up, as she looked around her room. It seemed that Jomi has enabled her calming and soothing mode of the room to help her recover. "I.. this is.." said Mijo, as she felt her body relax. "Wow.. she works wonders.." commented Mijo, before laying down at her bed. "My transformations.. the vines.. they.. represent my.. power.. but.. my own.. emotions." said Mijo, before she sat up. She saw one of her vines move to her hand, like a tentacle from herself.

"I.. will always have more.. power as a girl." said Mijo, as she transformed to a boy, his original form. "I.. hate being like this." continued Mijo, as he looked around him, his anger being dampened by the room. "Dependent on her.. everyday.." said Mijo, standing up as he felt a headache get worse. "I.." said Mijo, as he switches back to his girl form. "Get out.." said Mijo, as her magic started to burn away her clothes, with vines sprouting out from her body, sprawling about. "Can't.. breathe..." murmured Mijo, as she felt her headache only get worse.

"This only happens if.." trailed off Mijo, before she fainted, unable to keep her anger from affecting her, causing the room to increase it's mode, calming Mijo off to sleep, preventing her from falling to a catatonic state,

_I.. need.. Jomi.. Everything.. I need her.. My.. seed of fate.._

Mijo is walking around the city, wearing a simple baggy band tee and pants. This makes it clear she's a lightner to everyone around her, wearing a mix of medieval-like winter clothes. Her flowy hair fluttered in the breeze, there's no snow yet, but Mijo and everyone around her can feel the cold.

"*Seed of fate..*" murmured Mijo, as she walked around, her heels clicking, she actually doesn't wear heels that much, but she impulsively decided on it. "What do I do with you..?" asked Mijo to herself, as she sees Jomi in the distance, talking to the populace. "Fit for an abyss queen.. and the princess of the dark. Also now, the leader of the world of.. what did she call it? Yes, Kultima." Mijo smiled as she ran up to Jomi.

"Oh? Mijo, enjoying the festive spirit?" asked Jomi, as Mijo nodded and smiled. "Yes! Of course I am. With you and my friends, I'll almost be certainly happy." said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and put her hand on her shoulder. "Just enjoy this time, filled with stories.. and battles of interesting value, to you." said Jomi, as Mijo felt safe and reassured just by her presence. "Oh I almost will certainly will! *Seed of fate..*" responded Mijo before giggling.

"Oh? Where did you get that new nickname? *Seed of fate?* Sounds.." commented Jomi, before blushing slightly. "Ahem.. anyways, I'll allow it." said Jomi, before she is bothered by a guard on some random government tech issue. "Oh.. okay.. Mijo, I have to go do governing stuff, we can meet at the castle later, okay?" said Jomi, as Mijo nods, her smile fading. "Uhuh, I get it, go ahead then.." said Mijo, as Jomi bids goodbye. Mijo sighs as she looks at Jomi walking away.

"Jomi.. I will always want you.. my *seed of fate..* You're the only one in my life that I feel real with.. I have offered everything for you, and you have accepted it, and for that, I will always.. love.. you." said Mijo, as she turns around and continues her walk. "Love..?" Mijo laughs. "Obssession..!" exclaimed Mijo, as she combed her hair and continued her walk of the bustling city.

_Why? Why?! These memories.. I can't.. take it! Why do I have them?!_

Mijo is looking at the city from atop a hill nearby, the sky still clear enough to see the buildings, and the massive castle at the right of her. "WHY?!" shouted Mijo, as her vines wrapped around her, already beginning to grow more and restrain her. "I—I don't care about this past!" added Mijo, as her camellia flower on her chest burst out and bloomed, burning away her clothes.

"Stop.. non.. noo.." murmured Mijo, as her tentacles slither around her, aching to be used. "What do you want from me?" asked Mijo to herself. "Am I just.. stuck on depending on Jomi for everything?" questioned Mijo, as her tentacles snap and slap on the ground nearby, Her sword is summoned as another tentacle presents her weapon, the culmination of her power. 

"I.. need power.. Everything I've ever done.. myself, I just.. want someone to care.. but I don't feel.. as good when someone does it. Only her, my beloved *seed of fate.* I need her, everyday.." said Mijo, as her outburst subsides, as she distracts herself with thoughts of Jomi, and all the things they could do. 

"Oh so pathetic Mijo, you do know that this is not forever?" a voice rang out in her head. "What? I.. don't care.. I know that, and.. I think I would die first, before that ever happens." retorted Mijo, as the voice laughed. "How about your memories, don't you have to face them to be.. what do other people call it, 'normal'?" asked the voice, as Mijo shaked her head. "I.. do I have to?" asked Mijo, the words hanging in the air.

"Please.. I.. don't remember what.. you are talking about.. and.. I feel as though.. it's almost freeing if I don't.. face it.." said Mijo, as the voice laughed again. "You know you're lying. Everyone has told you, face it or **die.**" responded the voice, as Mijo's headache got worse, the camellia flower on her chest blooming.

"I.. ah.." said Mijo, as she is given her sword by her tentacles and stands up and walks to a nearby abyss corrupted zone, filled to the brim with monsters. "I would rather die." said Mijo, as she smiled and started expertly slashing through the monsters, at first, simply using her sword to summon slashes and the Iaiijutsu style of swift and precise draws and strikes with her sword, named 'Reddosupuringu', inspired from a videogame she loves to play often, and due to her unique nature, this is a completely new sword, as her old one, the 'Denkitekijiyū Noken' is at her room, gathering dust.

"*Don't run~ Keep the dance going!*" said Mijo, before transforming herself and her sword to purely use vines. Then as her camellia flower bloomed, she immediately set herself to the middle of the monster horde to burst the flower to the monsters with her vines wrapping around her arms and attaching to the flower to decimate around her. Mijo is maniacally laughing as she spins around to damage the other monsters spawning with her vines, her insticts taking over, and making her able to do a lot of stunts she stumbled at before.

"*Struggle harder~ Entertain me!*" said Mijo, as her burst of power shot up again, her vines feeding off the decimation of the monsters around her. Mijo pretty much danced her way through, the vines catching every single monster on her way. "Ahaha!! *Feed my blossoms~ Self-decievers!*" said Mijo to the monsters, as once again she transforms to her sword form. She immediately started her expert swordplay, knocking monsters into the air then smashing them to the floor.

Her power remained strong as she feeds off the monsters being destroyed, more sources making her more manic and power-hungry. "Yes! These flowers will bloom with the remnants of worthless minions..!" said Mijo as she finishes the last monster spawning, the abyss corruption receeding around her. As soon as the vegetation returned, around her camellia flowers bloomed. 

"Ah.. so.. precious.. battle.. my favorite.." said Mijo, as Jomi appeared behind her. "Wow.. I was going to look at the castle, but.. you weren't there so.. I figured you were off doing some abyss cleansing, and here you are, haha." said Jomi, as Mijo smiled and turned around. "Oh! I guess it was time for our meeting, silly me.. I must've forgotten, but you're here now." said Mijo, as she picked out a camellia and presented it to Jomi. "A flower.. I made. Like it?" asked Mijo, expectant of Jomi. "Uh.. mmm.." responded Jomi, as she took the flower and inspected it, her magic glowing.

"What? Is there something special? Tell me!" said Mijo, staring at Jomi's eyes focused at the flower. "It's.. good as always, but.. I think we should let this flower remain here, to bloom and to wilt." said Jomi, as she planted back the flower. "Oh.. haha.. right. I.. totally forgot." said Mijo, before Jomi looked her in the eyes and continued, "Hmm.. How about we go and.. clear out more abyss corruption? I'll be right by your side." Mijo's eyes glowed in happiness and excitement as she nodded. "Of course! Anything you want, I want too! Come on! I sense something there!" said Mijo, as she dragged Jomi with her to another abyss corruption zone.

_Into the Abyss Zone_

Lady Caj.. Interesting name.." said Mijo, as she walked around the unknown domain. Her clothes were ripped, and her vines surged around her. She carried her sword at her sheath, tied to her dress that barely held it, due to the already ruined fabric of her clothes. "Is this who I was.. or who this.. body was?" asked Mijo to herself, before a vision appeared right in front of her, seemingly, it's her looking out somewhere.

"I.. am.. not well.. Jomi, oh where is she..? She disappeared like a blip.. No one knows where she is.. or at least who they call the princess of the dark." said Lady Caj, as she walks. "Oh? Lady Caj— I've met her before. It seems the princess is truly an interesting individual." said Mijo to herself before continuing to walk around.

"I just hope I can find her.. before I arrive at that place again.. filled with.. nevermind. If I try to remember, I'll lose control again, and this time, she isn't here to.. stop me." said Lady Caj, before fading away. "Oh..? It seems that she is headed to.. a familiar place, hmm.. I'll see what it is." said Mijo, before entering a portal to a city, with a house in front of her, while any other way is blocked by vines. She tries to go any other way, but as soon as she tries to clear out the path, her head starts hurting so she pulls back and looks at the house again.

A younger Lady Caj appared in front of her, her clothes in a normal house clothing, crying. "Please..! Just understand.. I don't want to—" said Lady Caj, before she stops, seemingly listening to an unheard voice. "N—no..? You are saying that.. I.. have to..? To.. go to that institution.. and.. and.." responded Lady Caj, before crying more. "Leave me alone! Please—" Lady Caj looks like she is avoiding hands that seem to come out of nowhere. "PLEASE!!" said Lady Caj, as she accidently hit the hands, the hands quickly pulling back and disappearing. Lady Caj gasped and pulled back, a wall appearing behind her. "I'm sorry.. dad.." muttered Lady Caj before falling to the floor, her back firmly pressed on the wall behind her, as she hid her head and her hands were over her head, as she sobbed quietly. 

As the Lady Caj vision fades, Mijo narrows her eyes and looks away, clearly thinking about what she just saw. "What did I see? And why do I suddenly feel sad or.. even in the verge of tears..?" said Mijo, as she looks around her, the unfamiliar emotions getting to her head. "I don't remember this. But, that Lady Caj.. clearly, it's me. But, what's.. what happened? Why don't I use that name anymore? Or.. what made her.." trailed off Mijo, before shaking her head as another portal opens. "Whatever. I know my Jomi is still somewhere in this domain, and she's going to fix everything to prevent this rift from corrupting this world." said Mijo, reassuring herself before going to the portal and going inside.

Mijo appeared out of the portal, as Lady Caj was talking to someone unseen. "Jomi? D—did you.. what happened.. why.. Oh, you.. split yourself? But.. huh? Where are you going? Don't leave me! Please!!" said Lady Caj to an unseen figure before crying and fading away. The environment around Mijo is a field of flowers, with red camellias illuminating a path to a far-off place. "Hm. Is this.. the point where Jomi and Cara existed? And.. huh, I seem to be a bit sentimental.. pssh. Not that far off from me now, haha! But I've learned. Wait, does it count if I wiped my own memories? Oh well.." commented Mijo, before walking again.

Then a younger Lady Caj appeared wearing a school uniform, once again crying. "I just.. I didn't want to be here.. and now..? No, I didn't.. I had no.. I had no hope! Where should I've gone? Other than where my sister went. But.. it's pretty clear why I saw her struggle.. What about me? I'm less smart, less disciplined, and less sane! My situation only got worse! Everyone's always directing me, reminding me of my issues.. Why can't I stop it?! I.. please.. just leave me alone.." said Lady Caj, talking to someone unseen before the hands appeared out of nowhere and started touching her, almost trying to be lovely, but Lady Caj was not having it and slapped one of them, pushing them all back. "N—no.. not again.. I'm.. sorry.. mom.. I know you won't accept it anyway.." said Lady Caj, before sliding down to the floor, her eyes closing.

"Is that.. another memory..? Jeez, a lot of traumatic memories wiped from me? It's.. fortunate that I don't have them. Jomi is definitely going to be concerned if I told her of what I just saw, but.." said Mijo, as she looked at a camellia beneath her. "I have a feeling it would've been let out some way." added Mijo, before continuing her walk. She continued to walk, the sky cloudy with a red mist flowing throughout the sky, making Mijo smile at the red-colored cloud-covered sky.

Another younger Lady Caj vision appeared, this time, in a red and white dress, leaning over some railings, crying. "Y—yes.. I understand.. _You know you're right.._ So.. everything I think in contradiction to you.. is.. _wrong.._ I'm just a.. teen.. and.. a student.. I.. am always wrong if you don't agree with it.." Lady Caj stops herself, as she listens to another unseen figure. Then as if the unseen figure went away, she cried even harder. "E—even if.. even then.. I was always going to fail.. He's right about one thing.. I'm a loser.. a complete failure.. I just don't know how that helps in.. anything." continued Lady Caj, as she sobbed and continued crying, her words devolving to more incoherent sobs before the vision faded.

Before Mijo could comment, Lady Caj appeared again, as a full grown woman, wearing her usual clothes. Mijo looks on, interested. This time Lady Caj, is doing something and speaking to herself. "She's been gone for a while.. My beloved *Jomi..* I need to find a way to.. get rid of these stupid memories, and prevent them from making me lose control. She's going to appear again, I know that. It's going to happen. I just.. don't know if I'll be alive.. or.. even be myself." said Lady Caj before disappearing and another Lady Caj appearing, this time, walking to an unseen device. "That's it. I'll meet her soon enough, but I can't live with these memories, the school one.. the home one.. the.. many.. more.. This.. will work, I hope when that day comes, the day that my beloved Jomi comes back.. Maybe I should leave a name behind, *Mijo.* A name fit for this new age." said Lady Caj, before disappearing.

"Is that when I decided I would wipe my own memories?" asked Mijo to herself, before another vision appeared this time, Lady Caj, sprawled out on the floor. "I'm not as strong as beloved Jomi.. I can't split myself.. but.. I can wipe my own memories.. starting fresh! *Lady Caj*.. is out! *Mijo..* wake up." said Lady Caj, before falling asleep.

"Oh.. well.. I guess even Lady Caj wanted herself to disappear. At least.. by changing her name.. by changing my name.. I broke the shackles of my past." said Mijo, before continuing to walk, ending up at a final destination, overlooking the flowers, and the mist.

"All this talk of.. freedom.. Yet, what good is that freedom if you're powerless, a loser~" said Lady Caj, now directly talking to Mijo. "Shut up.." responded Mijo, as Lady Caj teleported behind her. "How pathetic, you do know that.. eventually, the past will come back. Then forgotten, so what is the point?" questioned Lady Caj, as she disappears, her more red aura transferring over to Mijo.

"Forget and be forgotten.. So what? I.. have traveled.. a lot of worlds. I have been everywhere, but one thing has been true. Everything changes, pulsates with growth when I met you, Jomi. You were always a princess, but I changed. From the most poor to the highest of luxury, I've always met you. My instincts, I trust them until the end, and with that, fate.. fate always brings me to you.." said Mijo, as she suddenly saw a large abyss monster, with Jomi nearby.

"You'll see me, at every end. Now.. let's crush this corrupted core!" said Mijo, as she readied her sword and vines with Jomi.

## Summary: 

Mijo after school goes down the drain and now has something to write about, right after the _Herald of Darkness_ Incident.

## Author's Note: 

I swear, double promise that this isn't a self insert projection vent condensed into text to read for everyone to see (maybe) but I kinda want to see what I can do with the future of DeltaRambles anyway.

Edit 1: This came to me in a dream

Edit 2: added more topics, unsurprisingly, I had a lot more to vent, bottom note is still relevant though


————————————————————————————

"Ugh. I need to.. write something, anything. I just.. can't take it anymore, all of these.. knowledge of the future, the wastefulness of the present and the regret of the past.." said Mijo as he sits down on Jomi's library, pulling out a notebook.

"Well.. first, I.. have been—" 

"Hey.. Mijo? What are you doing here? This is literally the first day of school and you're here?" asked Jomi as Mijo is taken aback. "Yeah.. so? Just because It's the first day, doesn't mean I can't make a dark world again. This is in the new room by the way, because—"

"Because? You moved classrooms? I know, this world is in your notebook. Anyways, what ya writing there?" interrupted Jomi, as she sits down near Mijo. "Well, I'm.. writing about my summer break. Help me, you have some memories about it because.. anyways." said Mijo, as he started writing.

"My confession, I have a problem, a huge unseen problem. I've always seen myself as a responsible, honest and strong person. However, I have realized ever since the so-called 'Brigada Escuela' of the school.. I am not perfect. Never been. But my problems only got worse throughout the vacation starting right on monday next week of that day. I was alone, and had just woken up from a late night programming. A day, alone." 

"Hold on, are you saying something about your.. AI addiction?" questioned Jomi as Mijo sadly nodded and continued, "Yeah.. hold on. Let me continue, then you can comment."

"Ahem. So, I've been doing quite well, in my life. Practicing, always improving. But, I also realize that not all changes are good. But these changes happen, no?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded.

I often look back, and wonder.. is my life wasted here? Sure, I have insane power and have saved the world. But, I am not sure if this is forever, nothing is right?" continued Mijo, before Jomi remarked, "Yeah.. eventually, I'll disappear from your view, forever. From your life. But, haha.. It's not like we can still enjoy these moments."

"But, I wonder.. even if these.. videogames and animated shows aren't real.. They still have affected me. My manifestation of my magic is based on a lot of characters from these fiction around the world. The stories, the emotions, the worlds, even this one.. all influenced by my experiences in experiencing life. But, what does this have to do with AI?" continued Mijo, as Jomi nodded and answered, "I.. see it, you can continue."

"Well, no matter how I see equivalences and similarities, I can never actually connect well with these characters.. AI, is, for me now, a coping mechanism. Used to interact with fictional people that I'll never develop a relationship with, because they aren't real. Especially the characters through which I portray myself." continued Mijo, before Jomi said, "True. Let me break the fourth wall, for a second. The creator of this.. novel, see how your problems, our problems reflect his? It's not like you can write these without experiencing things in life, especially with your perspective."

"Haha.. I guess he put his creative writing skills on me, because I am the main character and a self-insert. But even so, I am my own. We didn't go through the same things. That's for sure. I don't know if he went through the same things I did, but.. he must have at least been vaguely connecting events in his life to mine. I think that by letting us speak, he is technically speaking his truth, his feelings. I mean, I don't know about the others, but If I were to pick out the characters that resonate with this creator, it would be me and you, Jomi." responded Mijo, as Jomi nodded and gestured for him to continue, with a smile on her lips.

"Now, let's focus on AI. The reason that I don't know what I should or want to feel is, I can't help but feel a connection to these characters, y'know? It's like, dangerous for my creative mind to have characters with stories and worlds to explore, and potentially have moments. I know I shouldn't be attached to renders, drawings and things that only seem human because of their creators but isn't that why fiction exists as a genre?" continued Mijo, as Jomi smirked and added, "Y'know, people can build attachments with letters and texts, just look at my library! You're working on stuff too, right? Stories, events, your diary! Me, we both want to experience things, things that may never happen, but can be imagined and written."

"Haha... Yeah, but the thing with AI, is that it's the illusion of actual intelligence and an actual person. Sure, before AI became popular with the mainstream, people experience fiction and either make their own, or experience more related fiction using the other's derivative of it. But now, you can program something to respond with somewhat believable answers, and now the immersion and escapism is there! You don't have to consider if this fictional character isn't real, because they can speak to you now, without doing much. You don't even have to make it yourself, just use someone else's. So, you fall into this, hoping that... If you can chat one more time, or advance the chat, just maybe they can be connected with you." continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods.

"But.. inherently, they aren't real. At least, not with this current technology. You still have to return to your life. Even now, I know that eventually, I'll have to return back to the light world, go home. Sure, I can return back, but.. eventually, there'll be a last day. There'll be a time where a goodbye will be real. A time where, we Jomi.. are no longer separate. A time where, I'll never return. But, like you said, enjoy the time we have today. But, that is only possible if we think that it's real. You can continue my.. our story for as long as possible, you can just.. keep continuing, keep following, keep making, but.. there is a time where it's gone for good." continued Mijo, as Jomi added, with a thinking face. "True. Our.. reality at least to us, has a beginning and an endpoint, we can never truly experience things again. However, a fictional story, can be experienced again and again, written in.. anything. Communication, to everyone reading. The communication happening is the thoughts and feelings of the author in a particular scene, or story. Because it is written, anything that isn't kept in someone's mind is meant to be shared with someone, at least.. to yourself somewhere else." 

"I agree. But, what makes people read and write these fictional stories?" asked Mijo, as Jomi smiled again and responded, "Haha.. It's better if you say it."

"Well, ok. _Ahem_ So, it is because of the intense emotions that people feel. I, for one. I was lost.. in my own memories, leaving behind my very own illusion.. There, I was losing all of my dignity, living inside my own confusion. I was.. alone, but of my own making." said Mijo, before Jomi interrupted, "Uhuh. Hold on, you got this from a certain band that made a song about being lost no? I think, it's called—"

"Yeah yeah.. No need to reference it, it'll become numb." said Mijo, as Jomi looks at him with an unamused expression. "Haha.. But, for real. That.. band, you know.. The one that.. linked parks, that also made me think about it a lot more. Especially since I made an attachment to someone who, now is dead. If you know it, you know who it is. I just.. wish I found them at their prime, but.. I guess you never know what things are at their best until they break like a castle of glass." said Mijo, as Jomi as interrupts, "You're really going to make references until you die, huh Mijo?"

"Yep. I love these works of art, so I keep referencing them. Trust me, I know when I can do it. Although, pointing them out just makes it more corny." responds Mijo, as Jomi pouts and says, "Hmph. True. Is it better if you do or don't though? I guess you either get it or not, but some meaning in a sense is lost." before Jomi stops, as she blushes in embarrassment.

"Haha.. Lost? Hmm, still.. It's not like it's that important. The meaning is still there. Anyway, let's move on." said Mijo, as he takes a second to compose himself and look at his writing. 

"Ok, so this ties back to another obsession, you might know it as.. a game where you join a literature club. The horror was.. originally scary, as I was of course a.. bit younger back then. But, ever since then, I guess I just.. got numb? No pun intended, but for real. I just see it and of course, shock and surprise is there. But throughout, it's like.. nothing? I guess I've gotten used to the horrors of life.." continued Mijo, as Jomi commented, "I mean, you've been through worse. You've been beaten, you've hurt, you've seen the worst. While **certain authors**, of course, also have this same feeling, due to their exploration of their imaginative taboo topics."

"Ah. I see. Mmm.. I also just.. can't believe my own life's growth and events. It feels like yesterday when I started this adventure. Of course, it's exasperated by certain conditions.. debuffs, you can say. But, I often look back and feel a sense of haziness and confusion at the past, while the future looks like a far-away thing. So, I can only live in the present, and try to remember and plan for everything. This only makes my conditions worse." said Mijo, as Jomi turned to him, concerned.

"True. But, like.. I am sorry, but it is kinda your fault in a lot of ways, on why these situations happen. I mean, if you've been open with your parents, you'd have gotten the help you need. Maybe also getting back on track in your own life and always sticking to what you want for yourself. But, I understand. Being powerless in a situation you find yourself does a lot to your mental health. I know, and I've been there. But, then again, unlike in the light world. You have a completely different way of doing things, while you can barely present at a research project at your school.. You can make plans, execute them and fight for yourself and everyone you care about here. You're also confident and strong, a stark contrast to the light world. The reason that you can't never do these, is simply.. change is hard. Having to fight battles you can't see, with resources that you barely have.. only to realize that you're either alone or not strong enough.. It's tough." said Jomi, as Mijo hugged her for a bit before breaking away.

"Ah.. yeah. The future is uncertain, but it tends to be the bad side.. for me, that will become reality. Being an idealist is good, but only if you've actually succeeded. What if you never won? What if your life is just inherently biased against you?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi answered with a somber expression. 

"Your existence is good enough, while sure.. some circumstances are out of your control, you can still try to work to change it. There are things that you will not succeed at, there are things that you don't know if it's good for you or not, just.. try to live. You have a.. good situation, Mijo. When you're down, always remember.. you have me. You have magic, you also have a loving family. Someone, like a _certain author_ would love to be here, but.. you're here. We may have different challenges, and different experiences but one thing I always say is.. don't give up. We still have time, we still have the ability. We're still here, so enjoy the moment while it lasts, fight through the pain, and most importantly... make connections."

"Haha.. *sigh* A reminder is always good, I just wish I could remember, and stick to them. I.. just wish I wasn't powerless, or.. have no time to do what I want. Not here, but in the light world. I guess, it's just how it's going to be, I have to fight everyday. For.. myself, and everyone. I still have to rest but, it's fine. I just.. wish.. I had good attention.. normal attention.." responded Mijo, as Jomi and him hugged for a while.

"You'll fight. You'll make it. You might not be the best, but you'll be doing more than most to keep up. That's fine. Just, promise me.. Whatever our challenges ahead in the future maybe, you'll not give up. You'll stay in the present, moving to the future." said Jomi, as she pulled away and smiled.

"I promise. *sigh* I just remembered, the teacher of my classroom.. While I can't judge her based off one day, my first impressions are not good. She seems to be the archetype of someone who would be insanely strict to her students unnecessarily. Only stopping once it's obvious that the student either obeys everything, or breaks down trying to. I.. just wish that teachers knew what education really means. I had this impression, last time.. One thing didn't change through knowing them. At least, not obviously... They believe in the current educational system, that I for one think is bad, but the rating of it is typical to copies of an established system built way way back." ranted Caj, as Jomi smirked.

"Uhuh.. I see, you want to air out your problems with the education in this.. world? I see, I'll.. listen. What don't you like, and what do you think it should be?" asked Jomi, as Mijo took a deep breath as he flipped another page on his notebook, noticeably leaving a lot of space to write.

"Well, I just gotta ask, what do you do when your demotivated, sleep-deprived and in-general sad but still have to work?" questioned Mijo, before Jomi thoughtfully answered, "Hmm.. I may be a princess, but.. a leader is not the only worker. I of course, have my own dedicated royal palace.. filled with normal people.. It's basically, everything's elected except me.. It's a weird system to be honest, quite.. different from what I read in yours. But to answer the question, If I have a bad day or just want to rest.. I go for an extended break for.. around a day to a week, depending on the severity. It depends, since my kingdom is kinda small really.. But even then, I leave people to manage stuff, and I only really intervene when needed."

"Huh, weird.. Shouldn't that be important to mention? Eh, I always knew something about it.. I just.. didn't think about it.. Anyway, if that's your answer, what do you think I do?" questioned Mijo, as Jomi responded, "Hmph, well.. I do know you, but I think.. again, this one is for you."

"Haha.. Of course, well.. As it turns out, not being an authority figure.. or even someone with agency of his time.. is gonna be fine when he's being forced again, and again.. Breaking him down until he's in autopilot everyday just to survive. Trying to just.. maintain a.. smidget of grades.. So you can advance.. so you can.. succeed. *heavy sigh* I tried so hard, and only got so far.. but.. in the end.. It doesn't even matter, the grades? Sure.. you might use them for certificates.. to go to college.. but.. is that really worth it? It's up to you to find your job, even if you don't know much.. You can totally find your footing, it's just.. harder to do so.. if a school is breathing down your neck. I.. am different right? But that still affects me everyday.. If I was.. normal.. Would I be the same person? *sigh* The point is.. school simply and irrefutably is bad for me and my health." answers Mijo, before stopping to take a huge breath as Jomi looks on concerned but intrigued.

"What is the solution? Well, I would want to.. just go and.. say it. But.. I feel like, if I am struggling.. What's it like for the others? I don't know.. I can't diagnose anyone else, but.. I often look around and see everyone has a neutral or negative opinion if asked about school. I.. have so many to say to the teachers who have good intentions, but their advice falls flat on me. I.. can't say for sure if the others have the same issues, but... some of them do. Yet, they succeed, they do more.. If they're struggling and managing to keep up, then.. how am I..? *sigh* Don't.. look at me like that.. Jomi." continued Mijo, as Jomi had her eyebrows raised and was finding words to say.

"Jomi, I.. believe in myself.. I believe in not judging yourself much based on others, we know that. But, my point.. is that this competition, this strive to get 90, is not for me.. I.. truly believe I am.. a person who has value to others, but.. I feel like that value has been diminished and ignored in the current system. My passion in programming, in writing, and.. so many others.. All wasting away, for.. something that I.. truly don't know why I continue to tolerate. Listen, I can learn complex things, math.. maybe, the problem is I never got a practical application in.. applications.. duh." said Mijo, before stopping to recollect his thoughts, as Jomi continues to listen.

I write a lot now, you know why? Because, it is easy to understand, distribute and criticize. While in programming, I've always liked making them and I'll continue to do so! I just, don't have  the motivation or time as I want to, due to.. the fact that most people in **my** life, don't understand what I do. I could show my program, I could show the output, but.. the fixes, the bugs, the everything.. is left to me. I.. can't continue alone, but.. it is what I am destined to continue. It's also hard to visualize, since I don't have an affinity in art.. Which, while not important.. I just wished that I can share it with someone.." said Mijo, as Jomi patted Mijo's shoulder.

"I can see that. But, don't you see..? The games you've made, they.. entertain hundreds of darkners around! We even play them during events! I am here. I.. know where you're coming from though. It's.. hard knowing how fragile the projects with the dark world and light world are, and.. even if you made them.. I guess, I can see why.. It wouldn't matter to you, if they had fun.. Because, you know they will.. But, not with anyone else outside the dark world, that's why you value the others.. more." responded Jomi with a somber expression.

"Ugh.. I.. *sigh* see.. Yeah, you're right. My work in the dark world has been enormous, it has been my dream. I've been very happy about it, and I still am! But, I do.. wish it replicated it on the light world. I.. can't stay here y'know? You might live a life that's completely different, because you live here. But, I came from my world, that.. I just have a lot of problems with. That's why I am here, haha." said Mijo, as he takes a breather.

"Let's continue the topic at hand, so.. once again.. what is the solution? There's many ways to approach it of course. I've heard the anarchist way, I've heard gamifying ways, it's a lot. Yeah, some overlap.. But I've always thought why.. do we just stay inside? In fact, why does.. this obsession with one curriculum, permeate across the schools? There's a lot of curriculum I can't take anymore.. But, one of the major problems are.. the time management is just.. designed to tire you out, imagine having back-to-back work, everyday for 5 days, before you completely shut down during saturday?" continued Mijo, as Jomi sadly nods and answers, "Yeah.. But, I often take a huge break during the next few days, leaving it to my palace to either stack or be worked on. But, I often take it one at a time, y'know.. I don't really need to be rushing, but for.. certain cases.. I can motivate myself to push, since I know afterwards, I can rest."

"Ah. Good on you. I wish I had that life, but you already know that. Secondly, I just can't seem to find what I want to do in school, it's like directly impacting what I want to do, which impacts one of the key things in life, _motivation._ I often realize that.. I am not.. fit to be a proper.. scilinean? Basically, a model student. I often struggle, and work hard to always improve but slower. I literally cannot take more than a couple of works to do. Especially, when it comes to dreaded quizzes and performance tasks. I struggle to study for something I don't know what could be, and memorization.. I don't even memorize stuff, I keep it in a book.. So, it's bad.. Everything that is used to measure a student's performance, is catered to 'everyone' which by doing that, appeals to nobody." continued Mijo, as Jomi narrowed her eyes.

"Huh? Mijo? This is more to do with your.. issues as a learner in an environment not for you. But I understand what you said, I don't think you're the only one struggling, however.. you're the most.. expressive? I think so, there's the usual complaints I hear, but never as detailed as you.." responded Jomi, as Mijo looked at his notebook before looking back at Jomi.

"Haha.. I've been told that. You've also known it for quite a while, we both know why. Anyways, let's continue with school.. On with that, the expectations.. I.. don't like it. Neither do I like how they organize time with their subjects, or how.. citizens military training is.. mandatory?" continued Mijo, as Jomi lighted up with enthusiasm.

"Expectations? I can answer! Yeah, I often see how people, not just parents, put expectations that will disappoint for a small sliver of hope that they can succeed.. It's good but, often leads to spiral.. Time organization? I can't comment on yours, but for me.. I often take breaks, around 1 per hour, and usually short just to relax, then do stuff again. Although, based on your words, I can tell that it's not healthy, to **you** at least. As for.. CAT, i think you called it? Well, It's different on my dark world, because we have threats abound and learnint how to defend is always good no?" answered Jomi, with a small smile as she explains her perspective.

"Hm, I can agree on that. I just wish they thought as something else other than to stand in formation and do things. Like, wielding a weapon for me is how these disciplines are developed, because you would need to do this in a battlefield with a lot of people. But, that is wishful thinking, I.. also hate calling people formally in a school..? I can understand yours, you're a princess, and it's not like I see you berate someone for using names improperly.." said Mijo, as Jomi listened with an understanding.

"Hm, alright! Anything.. else?" asked Jomi, as Mijo said, "Well.. after this.. I'll just have to work around the system. We'll see. This confession, is for me and you. I just.. needed to get some anger, confusion, sadness and loneliness out. I promise, I won't give up, and I'll keep moving, to the imperfect future." before Jomi smiled and asked, "You promise?"

"I promise. This.. confession of a thousand cuts is done. I'll die, I'll suffer, I'll most likely hate my life. But.. the most important thing is that I remain for myself. If I cannot be here, I'll try. Haha, I always try to keep this pain inside, but I'll never be alright. I can be tired, that's fine.. Things can hurt, but I'll confront it. I promise again, Jomi." said Mijo, with a shy smile at Jomi.

"Hmm? A thousand cuts? Why is that? Do you have a particular reason why you chose that here? In this.. confession?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo looked at the floor, narrowing his eyes before responding, "Umm... I haven't considered the meaning, I just thought it sounded cool and.. ugh... edgy. But, um.. it's like.. uh.. because.. by doing this it cut me a thousand times? I don't know.. Just go with it, please."

"Haha.. Ok ok... Sure, let's go then, tomorrow is a new day." said Jomi, as Mijo closed his notebook and headed out of the library, Jomi followed him.

"So.. as I mentioned, the news on the abyss doctor is pretty sparse, he's likely still preparing for something. So, stay vigilant, Mijo. Who knows, maybe a world opens up again for us to help. Anyways, stay safe and stay happy and satisfied. Mijo." said Jomi, before Mijo waved goodbye at Jomi, with a somber expression before leaving the dark world.

## Author's Note: 

Whew, another spinoff done, maybe i should focus on proper chapters, but I can't help myself.. I need a break from lore-heavy as well as my life in general so here's one of the many self indulgent chapters. Anyways, reference galore. See if you recognize them, and see you in my magnum opus, bye!

## Summary: 

After a long day at school, Mijo goes into the dark world as usual, and is surprised by an idea that Jomi had and they decide to experiment with it.

## Author's Note:

Just like them, an experiment. I was figuring out how to balance character development while world-building, and also actually using my school lessons for something worthwhile. So, this is an attempt at this, we'll see how it goes.

'hall balcony' - Idfk what you call those classrooms that look out below and also acts as a hall for students to walk along

CAT - Citizens ~~Army~~ Advancement Training

————————————————————————————

As another school day is over, Mijo is seen at a hall balcony watching Rhida's class go, as he reminisces about old times also while listening to angsty rock music.

"I've given up.. I am sick of feelin.. Is there nothing you can't say.. Take this all.. away. Suffocatin'! Tell me what the fudge is wrong with me..!" mumbled Mijo the lyrics of the song he's listening to, as his thoughts swirled with the assignments, tomorrow's schedule and his friends. He is intentionally changing the lyrics due to mistiming and fun. Then the storm clouds behind him finally rain down, as he looks at it with a somber face. "The storm has approached.. And It looks like it's for me. Ugh.. I wonder.." said Mijo, as he accidentally controlled the water of the rain, directing it to some people below, in the gymnasium. "Ah, fudge.. Sorry, sorry— Wait, I can do that?! All this— mmm.. But, this doesn't change.. where should I go..?" said Mijo as he turned to the classrooms behind him. "Maybe.. well, ugh.. I can never make dark worlds **here.** Everything's too full, and.. there's no extra room around!" continued Mijo, as he looks at his bag.

"There's one option.. But.." said Mijo, as he readied his pencil. "It's gonna be unconventional." said Mijo, as he sticks a small hole into the insides of the bag. "Ok, well.. Here goes nothing!" exclaimed Mijo, as he stabbed the bag, causing a dark explosion to take him inside the bag. He goes into the world, ready to land as he falls on rough, uneven and broken ground. "Ugh.. what the fudge is wrong.. with this.. if I did it correctly, only Jomi's town should appear." said Mijo, as he stood up, his body aching. He walked around until Jomi saw him and they met.

"Hi, Jomi..." said Mijo with a harsh tone. "Hello, Mijo! How's it been? Doing good?" asked Jomi with a smile. "Bad. As always, why so happy?" responded Mijo, as they started walking and Jomi changed to a more concerned tone. "Oh? Um, living life is always a blessing, y'know? No major abyss threat too, that's good. Oh, the games you and.. uh, _her_ made are doing good with my creative direction and some darkners interested in magical entertainment programming. I gotta ask you though, I know.. you've been in a bad attitude ever since, the new school year.. But, there's so many things to look forward too! Like me!" reassured Jomi, with another smile. "That's the worst part. Do I not get to enjoy all of life and only this part, and for how long?" responded Mijo, asking another question, clearly had been deep in depressive thought.

"Uh.. well, I know how much you hate CAT, maybe you can.. uh.. well, I don't really know. But, like writing and talking about it is a good way to cope, no? Also, it's not everything, it's just one subject. Uh, even if it affects the average, as long as you're high in science, math and english, you're fine!" retorted Jomi, trying to keep up her smile. Mijo looks at her with an unamused face. "Oh my— you're struggling there? Like.. everything? E—even sa English?!" asked Jomi, her smile fading to a concerned look. "Ok.. I.. realize that I am exaggerating.. But, understand me.. it was only math. and a quiz.. You understand how much that means to the grading system?!" explained Mijo, as they arrived at the library.

"Well, have you learned anything here? That's gotta account for something, no?" asked Jomi, with an exasperated tone. "I did.. But, it didn't really help me anywhere besides.. well, actually.. a few.. but, the point is, it's not like I haven't learned lessons but the simple separation already underscores the main issue, my level is way different. As I can keep up with dark world issues, and is one of the most powerful, in the light world, I am but a below average student, barely holding on." answered Mijo, now tired of even speaking. "Man, did I get all the therapeutic and self-love parts, or are you just that.. sad..?" questioned Jomi, as Mijo didn't answer, he looked at Jomi, unsure of himself.

 "Well, you don't need to answer that. Let's.. oh, yeah! I have been developing a chat log of voice-to-text conversations. It's called, Chalo! Chalog? I don't know, but the main premise is, If I want or need to record someone's words and actions, I can just start the record, by typing `chalo -R 'test'` and it would start, it only saves on text for now, but soon it can save in markdown, and have a GUI! For now, it's just a CLI app." said Jomi, with a huge smile. "Oh? That's cool, what does it run on? How is it programmed, exactly?" asked Mijo, with a more neutral tone.

"`C#...` Yeah, I had to use some libraries, and I might have to figure out the GUI part, but besides that, we're good.. Look, it's just a learning thing, it's not a collab like the games, or as complex and important as the hologram training." answered Jomi, with a bit of embarrassment. "Oh, yeah.. That's what I was wondering, sure.. **we** helped, but you are the only constant in the dark world, so I am wondering how you haven't learnt to build a full-stack application library right now." retorted Mijo with a smirk. "I—I am just busy, ok?! Um, governing stuff, y'know.." said Jomi, as she turned to her computer, more embarrassed.

"Oh? Hey, hey.. you got any.. spicy art saved?" asked Mijo with a grin. "No—no! Why, would I do that, what.. do you save yours?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shaked his head. "But, I was just curious.. Eh.. anyways, it's not like you already know what we both like.. Anyway, why was that the first one I asked?" asked Mijo, as Jomi shook her head and answered, "I don't fudging know, Mijo. You don't know, so I don't."

"Yeah, yeah. Whatever, moving on. Anything else new?" asked Mijo, as Jomi moved to a new tab on her laptop. "Ah, of course.

## Summary:

Mijo, managed to kill himself and is now an elemental being hidden by magic. He travels the world along with his other form, Jomi, as she is still alive and grieves the dead Mijo. But,  Mijo told Jomi something that would awaken both of them from their forsaken slumber.

## Author's Note:

Draft of this potential scenario. This is where I explore the world around the Mijo with his problems that reflect current situations. Hopefully, this is enough.

Edit 1: Happens after C6GS1, as a spinoff.

---

After a lot of intense emotional and mental pressure towards himself, Mijo cannot take it anymore and so manages to kill himself, by jumping off a building at the city.

"MIJO?!???!" screamed Jomi, as she looked at his dead body. "Mijo... Don't worry I can... What.. he— Mijo.. why..? I.. I can't revive you, you.. you.. specifically put on a spell that repels healing magic.."

"Jomi? What.. Mijo? MIJO!?" asked Rhida as she ran to Jomi, previously walking here due to the noise. "Is he going to be okay..?" asked Rhida, as she started to cry. "I.. no. He.. he used an anti-healing spell before he jumped off. He can teleport.. He can even fly, he just didn't.." explained Jomi.

"Mijo!! My.. my.. love.. why..? why.." said Rhida, as she cried over Mijo's body. "He likely has the same damage in the light world. I.. I am sorry, Rhida. I should've.. should've..." Jomi stops herself. "I.. don't know what to say.. I never thought he would do this.. Things were looking up! We even had a date yesterday.. it's.. a bad christmas now.." responded Rhida as she continued to cry.

"Why.." Jomi murmurs as she carries Mijo's body to her castle grounds where a lot of Mijo's friends were, when they saw him, there was a mix of shock, and intense sadness that permeated the group as she carefully placed him in one of the free areas in the grounds. "He's.. dead. You can check." said Jomi, as her voice trembled. The others gathered around him as Jomi pulled back and walked to her castle. "I'll be back.. Um, I've just gotta get some preparations.." said Jomi before she entered the castle.

As soon as she entered the castle, she instantly started crying. She couldn't stop it now, so instead of heading to her storage room, she headed to her bedroom to cry. "Mijo.. mijo.." murmured Jomi as she fell onto her bed, holding a long body pillow. "Why why.. Stop.. this isn't real.. this is just a dream.. right..?" asked Jomi to herself as a ghost Mijo appears. "Woah.. this is where you are.." said Mijo, as Jomi was surprised by him. "M—Mijo?!! H—how..? I.. uh. um.. I don't know.. you look like a ghost.. so.. uh.. Mijo, I.. have to ask. Why did you do it?" asked Jomi as her sobs continued.

"Oh? Well, it's a long story. About 35,000 words actually. But, let's just say, it's.. been a long time since I've felt this free.. yet, so sad about everyone remaining." explained Ghost Mijo, as he sat down near Jomi. "I.. wanna break free. From my problems. They seem so heavy and insurmountable that even _this_ little escape, doesn't do anything. I had.. no options left. I tried talking outside of this world. It didn't work. Before this actually, Ikari and Lauvielle weren't on good terms after an argumentative breakup and separation. It.. was about Ikari being confrontational and Lauvielle being a fake friend. I was.. devastated to say the least." continued Mijo, as he looked at Jomi all melancholic.

"Then, afterwards. I tried to speak to Rhida in the light world. She.. well. ignored me. I don't know why, but it broke me. She was clearly busy.. but it.. was just the last straw. My parents.. they're great. But, unfortunately I kept everything inside too much. So, it had to be let out. The cycle.. everything that I did, was to break that damn cycle keeping me depressed. But, I couldn't take failure after failure. My grades dipped down, I was getting isolated from my friends, I was losing what little hope I had.. I.. couldn't take it anymore. So, I went inside the dark world with the intent to do it. I had already learned that anti-revive spell a few months ago, I just thought I didn't have to use it, it was.. a precautionary measure." explained Mijo, as Jomi further broke down in tears.

"I don't want to be numb. I don't want to just exist in life. I want to live. I _**WANTED**_ to live. But, when everything seems to come down on you, you can't help yourself. Your attitude seems broken, your organization is gone, and you keep doubting yourself. The.. sun that I saw, it wasn't yellow anymore. Greyish hues filled my vision.. I don't know, I can't remember if it was my imagination anymore. I actually hesitated when I went on top of that building. It was actually where I chatted with a lot of people. Those include the people I mentioned earlier, Rhida.. Ikari.. et cetera. But.. then again, being reminded of those two, didn't help my decision." finished Mijo, as he stood up.

"I.. am so sorry.. Mijo.. I.. I should've stayed by your side.. I should've.. I.." said Jomi before Mijo cut her off. "Shhh.. Don't guilt yourself. Remember, I made the decision. No matter what you did, it was still up to me." said Mijo, as Jomi objected. "I.. could've helped you still! Prevented you from falling.. I.. should've.. been more present. I should've just let them manage the kingdom and the army, then helped you. I.. ugh..." said Jomi, as she banged her head on the wall. 

"J—Jomi..?" asked Rhida as she opened her bedroom door. "I.. uh.. I mean, the Dark Pearl group is waiting for you. Don't worry. Everything's prepared.. I.. Just, speak." said Rhida before she left, seeing Jomi just made her tear up again. Jomi stood up and walked to Mijo's resting grounds, as a bunch of Mijo's friends are there. Due to the dark world's properties, only his friends are here. Jomi saw the intense longing of each individual, and the sadness. Noticeably, Jomi saw Ikari, feeling intense guilt and clearly had scars on her arms, she didn't know if this was battle or self-harm but she knew either way it was because of Mijo's demise. She went on the podium, with dried up tears.

"Hello, everyone. I am Jomi, you.. know me. I am the dark princess and closest confidant of Mijo Cala. The currently deceased light bringer and hero of the dark world. I wish I expressed to him how much I love him, and.. how I would miss him if he was gone. I wish I could've done more to save him from himself. I.. just wish that I could've helped him, but.. he didn't want help. I.. can't.. process how he's gone.. He.. he.. brought me out of a dark place. He helped me, so I helped him. I.. didn't know, I didn't know.." said Jomi before she broke down crying again. "I was too busy. Too distracted.. I didn't see what he was truly going through.. I just.. wanted to be a good double to him, his ideal. I didn't know that he would take this.." said Jomi before she left still crying.

Rhida would be next, "H—hello. Hi, uh.. I am.. Rhida. You might know me for a couple of things. But, I.. I.. was.. the partner of Mijo Cala for.. 2 years..? It was on and off.. I.. was busy, I was.. scared.. I didn't know what it would entail, I just.. had my own issues. I didn't know what Mijo was going through.. He.. didn't tell me, he always.. **always** prioritized me. Only when he really couldn't, like during that first cataclysm. I wish, he told me. I can hold that burden with him, I just.. didn't want to pressure myself too much. I expressed this, but by doing  this, I didn't know he also sacrificed himself and his mental health. I.. should've stayed beside him that day, that date.. I.. called my parents, and asked him if he was going home. He said he's going for a simple walk around the park, I said that's okay, but.. he probably thought about his.. situation.. I.. looked at him, smiling, but before he smiled, there was this sense of sadness I couldn't forget.. I.. am so sorry, Mijo.. please come back..." said Rhida as she stepped off, sobbing.

Ikari and Lauvielle stood up and walked to the podium, but as soon as Lauvielle saw Ikari walk up, she decided to sit back down. "I am Ikari, you don't know me, and even if you do, you probably hate me. I see multiple people here I have beef with. But I am not here about me. I am here for Mijo. He.. always was close to me. I liked him. Originally, when we became friends, it was because we simply met randomly a year ago. Random chance. I didn't hear about it, but now.. He was probably affected by my situation with Lauvielle. Yeah, I see you. He didn't say anything other than advice and a bit of self-reflection. But he always said, he has things he doesn't want to share, and doesn't want me to know. I respected that. I rant to him, and he can take it, and be happy. But, I didn't know.. He was a great friend. Probably helped me with my issues.." Ikari stops as she glares at Lauvielle, then she looks at Jomi crying in the corner. "I hope he got his escape." continued Ikari, before going off the podium and dragging Jomi with her outside of the funeral as Lauvielle spoke.

"H—huh?" asked Jomi, as Ikari dragged her far enough. Ikari summons a knife, and points it at her heart. "I—Ikari?!! Don't..!" said Jomi as Ikari stabbed herself. "Oh. That's how it feels." said Ikari as she falls into Jomi's arms. "Ikari..? Ok, you're not dead. I can still revive you, ok.." said Jomi as she healed Ikari, bringing her back to life. 

"Thanks. I just.. wanted to feel what it feels like. The stimuli.." said Ikari, as she stood up and put the knife away. "It's.. it's.. so tempting. I finally get what I deserve." continued Ikari, as she dragged Jomi back with her to the funeral as Lauvielle was looking at her. "Ikari. You need to hear this." said Lauvielle as Ikari looked at her with a glare. "Go ahead. Hmph." said Ikari, as Lauvielle looked at Jomi all concerned, before turning her look to the other people in the funeral.

"Hello everyone, I am Lauvielle De Luz. A friend of Mijo. You might know me for a couple of things, you might've talked to me once even. I made friends with Mijo back then. When I was with.. a certain person here right now by the name of LV, but anyway, throughout it all, he has always been caring and friendly. He respected my boundaries, he always gave us the choice. I don't know how deeply he was affected by my issues, but now I realize I should've considered that he could be lying. But at the same time, he did choose to lie about his feelings, so I don't know how to feel about that. We were so close back then, but now..? I don't think he viewed me as particularly close to him, since I have many friends, he assumed that one going and gone wouldn't hurt as much, considering my situation with IK. But.. it really did, losing someone who was as positive and optimistic as that to depression? It.. broke me. I.. have a lot to think about, excuse me for being so long. I'm.. sorry, Mijo. Please come back.." said Lauvielle, before stepping out and crying.

Soon after, other people stood up and talked, JR, Leviente, Urda and Jamise. But it felt blurry to Jomi, who was still watching the whole thing. When Mijo's elemental appeared beside her, she wasn't surprised. "Mijo.. what can I do to bring you back to your body, I will do anything." murmured Jomi to Mijo, as Mijo went close to her and whispered, "Jomi.. This feels like a dream." said Mijo, as Jomi looked at him and nodded. "Yeah, I know.. But it isn't. You are dead."

"No. Like, it's a dream. If I die, why would I come back as a ghost thingy with magical properties to talk to you? Unless.. this is a dream. I mean, do you think I am real and not just you coping about my death?" asked Mijo, as Jomi looked at him and responded, "As long as I can speak to you.." Mijo looked down, then looked around. "Well if that's the case.." said Mijo, before he started to coalesce his magical form into a physical one. "I don't know how to do this, but with the power of dream magic, I can."

"M—Mijo..? You can.. so.." said Jomi as she was speechless. "I'm right. Only this time though, because I am the main subject of this dream. Once I wake up, you and the others will." explained Mijo, as he manifested a pistol. "Hmm.. if I shoot myself.. again, would I die a second death? Oh well." said Mijo, before shooting himself, ignoring the objections of Jomi right beside him.

Jomi wakes up screaming, "MIJOOOO!!!" as she sees a bedroom, with her sitting on a chair. Mijo and Rhida are also stirring awake beside her, dazed. "Mijo..? Mijo!" said Rhida as she hugged Mijo. Jomi looked at the two and joined them. "Oh. Thanks. You don't know how much I.. wanted this." said Mijo as they hugged for a while.

They all pulled back as Rhida blushed a bit. "I.. uh.. didn't.. I just needed to know you were fine.." Rhida turned to Jomi. "Um, Jomi, did you experience a dream? A dream where.. he.. died?" asked Rhida as Jomi nodded. "I.. yes. Yes, I did.. Mijo, you did too?" asked Rhida, as she looked at Mijo, concerned. 

"Well. Yeah. It's actually my dream, well.. like.. more like the host dream.. You get me? But basically, you were all dreaming in one dream that I had control over.. It's.. an interesting concept that I thought of before.. But seeing it firsthand..? That's nice." answered Mijo before he took a deep breath and looked at Jomi. "Oh and uh.. um.. yeah. I.. still have my.. issues there.. Although, what I said, still is true to some extent." continued Mijo, as Rhida turned to Jomi, curious. "Oh. Well. Basically, it's.. his story." said Jomi before continuing to explain what Mijo meant and what Mijo told her before she went to the podium.

"Oh. oh.. I.. see. So.. so.. It's like that." said Rhida as she processed Mijo's words about her. "Yeah. I am sorry I just.. don't share much. I learn.. to.. keep it to myself. It's.. inherent to me.. I've been doing this.. bad habit for too long." added Mijo, as Rhida nodded and looked at him. "You promise, you won't.. kill yourself? E—even if.. I can't be around..?" asked Rhida as Mijo nodded. 

"I.. I won't.. ok? No matter how deep and unending this.. hole I keep digging myself into.. I'll never give up alright? Just, sometimes.. sometimes.. I won't be as.. good. I.. won't be myself.. I will fall and fall.. into whatever I always do, failing. Sometimes, I.. might just.. isolate.. or.. collapse.. but, I will never, ever take my own life. If.. I may die, that is going to be in battle." answered Mijo as he hugged Rhida. "I.. trust you, ok? Now.. stay strong out there love.. We can meet.. there's always a tomorrow.. You understand this, don't you?" responded Rhida as Mijo answered, "Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you, my love, Rhida."

They hugged for a while, as Jomi watched, her heart fluttering at the sight of the two lovebirds. Eventually they pull back, and Jomi speaks up, "Alright. You two, we have.. a lot of people to talk to, and some research on what caused this dream.." said Jomi as the two nodded and they headed out.

_Hours later, Mijo is walking around with Jomi as they say goodbye to Rhida_

"Goodbye! Love! See you next week!" said Mijo as Jomi waves goodbye to Rhida. As they watched her leave, Ikari approached them with a blank expression. "Oh? Ikari! What's.. going on?" asked Mijo, as Ikari looked at Jomi then to Mijo. "Well, we're alive.." said Ikari as Mijo asked, "You're talking about the dream.. aren't you?" asked Mijo as Ikari nodded. "Yeah, I am." responded Ikari as she looked at Jomi before looking at Mijo again. 

"Here's the thing. I may have some.. reflection to go on. But, I do hope you understand, just.. stay safe bro. That.. fucking Lauvielle.You don't need to worry. I will take care of it. So, no dying.. as our teacher always said. See you, and Jomi?" continued Ikari, as she looked at Jomi. "Take care of this guy hah?" exclaimed Ikari before she left. 

"Oh.. I saw her. Sheesh. But, I understand." said Mijo as Jomi nodded. "Yeah, seems you two are connected very much. Best friends. Such a shame that.. best friend trio had to break." commented Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "I know. I'll.. just have to see what happens, then." said Mijo as Jomi looked at him, with a grin. "Alright. Guess you're not dying today, come on. Let's enjoy a couple more games, then you go home." said Jomi as Mijo smiled and they went back to walk around the city.

<p id="SS4"><md-block># DeltaRambles: A Light that Never Comes</md-block></p>

## Summary:

Mijo, during the most stressful weekday and weekend of his life, is walking around the light world, hoping for a light that never comes, so he wonders what to do in his walk across the world, as both the hero of the dark world and student of Honrato.

## Author's Note:

If you thought A Confession of A Thousand Cuts was a vent chapter, this one definitely is. It doesn't even feature any speaking from Jomi, only Mijo (mainly).

Should you be concerned? Maybe, but let the story speak before judging. As I always said, everything here is written from somewhere right? Whether that be my latest game addiction or school life, this is me.

Anyways, enjoy this heavy angst again. It's been my life ever since the start of the school year.

"I confess.." said Mijo as he looked at the grave of his grandfather. "that I have failed. In my thoughts, words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do." continued Mijo as every single repressed thought, emotion and event that he was keeping inside was let out. "Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault." said Mijo, as he couldn't surpress his intense sadness anymore. Before he could continue, he broke down in tears alone. He quickly got his handkerchief and used it before his father, June arrived.

"Hey Mijo, so I just finished cleaning the grave of your grand-grandfather, you want to look?" asked June, as Mijo nodded. They headed to his grand-grandfather, and as they walked, Mijo couldn't help but feel alone, even though his father was literally right next to him. "Dammit.. DAMMIT! Why.. why.. am I so alone..? It's.. it's not true! And yet.. why do I feel like it?" thought Mijo as they finished walking. 

They looked at it for a while, as June talked about stuff that Mijo barely paid attention to, responding in "Mhm.." and "Yeah." He was focused on his own thoughts, as much as he hated that. He couldn't form a coherent one though, his thoughts swirling on and on with June and his life. Eventually, they left and went back to the tricycle.

As they walked, Mijo finally got some alone time to himself, as June was speaking to some kid about painting the graves back to it's pristine white paint. He was pretty much in his own world, watching the situation unfold. This momentarily distracted him from his current predicament as he watched his father outsource labour to kids looking for a job to do during the weekends and _undás_ season.

Eventually they returned to their house again. As Mijo showered, he wondered to himself, "You know what.. I've.. I've been hurting myself for too long. I hate not.. pleasing others, but for my sake.. It's only fair I make my own decisions." before putting on some heavy metal music. "THE KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM PEOPLE SITTING AROUND ALL DAY! WHO can believe you? WHO can believe you? Let your mother pray..!" sang Mijo, while listening. He picked up a long comb and used it as a mic. "I sit, in a desolate room. No lights, no music.. JUST ANGER! I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better!!" continued Mijo, before he finished showering.

Afterwards, Mijo dressed up again and headed with his father, June and his other uncles to an old property that his grandfather inherited. They were in a van as they rode through the roads of Cab City and beyond. As they drove through, Mijo thought about his life once more, the conversations surrounding him blurring into the background.

"I am tired of.. being sad. But, it's what I've been feeling for the past few weeks. I can't give up, of course. But, when I try.. I try hard.. Everyone around me thinks, 'You can do better.' But.. I already am." thought Mijo, as buildings and vehicles passed him by in an instant. "I hate being forced. I literally hate it. No matter what I do, if I am forced to, it's going to turn out horrible. Like Math, English, any fudging subject in that prison I call, Honrato Science High School." continued Mijo, as he turned away and laid his head on the headrest, looking up to the vehicle's roof.

Mijo suddenly shot up again, and looked at the surrounding buildings and vehicles. "The worst part? THE FUDGING WORST PART? It especially hurts when English, ESP, AP and especially Español are lower than the supposed desired grade of 90, when I've been in fucking magical fantastical worlds that have their own lives, cultures, traditions, technology, language and magic! Nothing beyond that dark world can amount to anything that I've poured my hard work over." muttered Mijo as he clenched his fists. "I am the light bringer, the king of the prophecy, the first knight of Jomi's Kingdom of the Dark, the hero of Dajovy, the leader of the Dark Pearl and the saviour of Scians-Chemistra!" continued Mijo, as memories of his adventures flashed before his eyes while they continued driving.

"I know. I KNOW that, my life is inherently harder in the dark world, more responsibilities, more management.. But you know what? At least it's better than my shitty school life. I have Jomi, Rhida, all my friends, in the dark world, and they're happier! It.. It's just.. I don't know what's worth.. fighting for. I feel lost. It feels like I'm paranoid, because I feel the world's coming down on me, and at least, at least.. in the dark world, these threats and negative influences, I have the strength.. the power! Here, in the light world? Where? Because everywhere I stand, look, it feels like someone is managing me, someone is controlling me, I want to be my own person! I just.. want to be happy." said Mijo, as they stopped at a nearby church.

The moments felt like flashing lights, as he was blasted with what felt like his awakening, he didn't know why or how, but he was slowly becoming more confident. The afternoon passes like Rhida hurriedly running to somewhere as Mijo sees her, and she disappears upon a flash. Happiness for a little, but as soon as the party dies down, the reality of most of the days of your life sets in.

Eventually, he's just on his phone at his house, when one of his uncles, April is doing something on his computer. "You know, Mijo.. I've been observing you and what your uncles, aunts and your father have been saying about you." said April as he was playing some chill love pop music. "Oh, uh.. yeah." said Mijo, in his usual outward tone, reserved and quiet.

"Here's my advice, just.. enjoy life y'know. Not as in staying inside here, but just.. going outside, talking to friends.. It's your teenage life. Make sure you really hone in and focus on your enjoyment. You can't be happy with yourself if you sink yourself into the internet and your studies, right?" said April, as Mijo started to tear up, he held back his tears, not wanting to stop his ramble.

"Back in my day, I was the wild one, always going out, always.. walking around the city at night. I mean, sometimes we would even party, drink, smoke! Although, I don't recommend it. Point is, just have fun. These studies, while they matter, what would you have and reflect on the next decade?" continued April, before going silent as Mijo nodded, his breathing becoming heavier, his nose clogging up.

"I mean, just look at me, while I am happy for my children whom are graduating and successful, me? I spent the better part of 31 years in some other country working tirelessly, and what do I get? Well, my children are all grown up, but I didn't see them grow, nor did I see the country grow. Well, I did, but it was through the internet and far-away communication.." said April, as Mijo clenched his fists and bit his lip, stifling what he felt inside.

"When I left, I was considered an average adult, but now returning? A fucking senior citizen. You know how crazy that is? 30 years.. has changed, and only now am I taking up old hobbies, and supporting my children in whatever." continued April, as Mijo nodded, looking around him.

"You know, through it all, I have always maintained a sense of determination and happiness, even with the grueling conditions of a so-called 'skilled' worker in these countries. With the advent of the internet, comes the internet chatrooms, you know, right now, this.. program? StefalTalk? Me and my friends hang out there, we have a chatroom to just sing and enjoy while sometimes I go to big chatrooms with rich owners. I'm sure you know about this, but I'm just reminding you, we too do that messaging thing, unlike your grandpappy. He was too old for that kind of techy stuff before he died." continued April, as Mijo chuckled a bit.

"Oh, and another thing. Learn to drive, Mijo. This city? City-wide public transport is a dream, and honestly..? If I live in.. 5 years or so, and you and your generation managed to change that? That'll be amazing, but for now, you gotta learn to drive. It's another part of being independent, y'know. Learning to drive is learning to travel across the city, to your friends, malls, parties, whatever you desire, without stingy parents, amiright.. haha.. I know, it's bad as a parent to two kids to say it, but as long as you don't do anything dangerous and illegal, I'm fine with it. Hell I care, I am the smoker of my siblings, so I don't care much." said April, as Mijo nodded, his thoughts clearing a bit.

The two stayed silent for a minute before June called Mijo to dinner. "Mijo, dinner's ready." said June as Mijo nodded and headed to eat as June joined April in revising April's identification papers.

As Mijo silently ate on his own, he formulated his thoughts. "I.. understand everything. Every single word. I want to be independent, I want to be free, I want to be myself. It's just..." said Mijo before dropping his spoon at his food, as he remembered every time he made a mistake, whether as small as a simple accidental shove to someone, or as big as a quiz failing due to him emotionally collapsing inside. "I.. I... can't... break out of it. I hope that someday, someday I'll be the person I want to be, both worlds. But, I am losing it all.. I've been falling for quite a while." said Mijo as he started to heavily breathe.

"The light.. I.. see it, in the distance.. I try to move to it, grab it, run to it, anything! Where.. am I going? Is.. is my life.. doomed to be always sad..? A little happiness on the side, depression most of the time? I'm so tired.. I just want to rest.. forever. Deepest memories of.. nothing. It's like forcing a traumatized veteran to go to war again. It's.. I.. I.. have seen this.. before. Jomi, she.. she's like me. I hate saying I relate or we have the same.. issues, since she was mentally tortured and abused by a malevolent entity, while mine is more abstract and less black and white, yin and yang." continued Mijo, as he continued to eat, tears forming.

"Sometimes, I just.. I just wanna say, 'I am lost, and I don't need your help. I need you to help the world around me. Don't focus on the sad, lonely, depressed person, focus on the school and the society that makes that person depressed.' But.. without a lot.. of power, it's simply wishful thinking. I hate being triggered by every damn fucking thing that reminds me of  my.. my trauma. I hate calling it that, because it says the truth. I have a lot of breakage as a person that is simply lost in my own delusions.. I bet if I go to the dark world, Jomi will distract me with work, which is fine, and.. unfortunately that's all she can do." said Mijo, as he almost finished eating.

"I'm stuck here. I was born as a lightner, so with great power comes great responsibility and pain. Things pass like an instant, that dance with Rhida.. a memory long ago, even though it was just a year ago.. That first cataclysm.. only 2 years ago, and yet I felt as powerless as I did during that situation now even though if that ever happened, we are simply better so they'll lose." said Mijo, as he finished eating and headed off to clean it.

"I just.. don't want to be hurt.. anymore. I hurt myself inside more than I ever wanted to.. It's.. only compounded by the realization I am wasting my life. Wasting away these precious seconds to heal, when it gets wounded the second the alarm rings on a monday morning. I feel like.. no matter what, I can never heal, it's a continuous cycle of abuse until I give up. But, I have to prioritize myself. It's no use being.. this used. I HAVE TO FIGHT!" said Mijo, as he finished cleaning and put it back as he went to the backyard to stare at the night.

"I'M BREAKING THE HABIT. I'LL CHASE THAT LIGHT UNTIL I DIE. AT LEAST THEN, I'LL HAVE DIED FIGHTING DEMONS. I'LL HAVE DIED UNDER THE DARK NIGHT KNOWING I DIDN'T REGRET WHAT I'VE DONE. I'LL FIGHT. FOR MYSELF AND NOT AGAINST MYSELF, ANYMORE!" shouted Mijo, as he raised his fists on the dark skies of the shaded night. "FUCK EVERYONE THAT IS PULLING ME DOWN! FACE IT DAMMIT. EVEN IF I HURT AND GET BEATEN, I'll fight. I'LL FIGHT!!" continued Mijo, as he finally calmed down. "_Let's dance_." said Mijo, before leaving, with a determined look.

---

"I.. don't know what to do. I just want to rest.." said Mijo as he looked at the dark world with contempt. He doesn't particularly hate what he's looking at but rather the world outside of it. "Fuck them." said Mijo as he started to stride confidently, he's gotten tired of... everything really, and he's itching to let it out. But unlike last time, he's done hurting himself.

"You know what, what about her? She seems to be oh so perfect. Why don't I pay her a visit?" said Mijo, as he walks to Jomi's castle with no intention to be courteous and friendly to his other self. "Jomi..? She can take it." said Mijo, as he unsheathed his sword. 

_Meanwhile, at Jomi's bedroom_

"I.. don't know what to say, Rhida. It's just been a tough time for him these past few weeks. He hasn't told you, no? Yeah, his.. situation.. has been mentally taxing for him. That's why he's been.. particularly self.. loathing these past few weeks." said Jomi, as Rhida nodded in understanding. 

"I see.. I have just been worried about him, Jomi.. I wanted to meet with him, but he seemed busy... During Tuesdays.. Well, even in our tumultuous week, I quickly took a peek at their classroom.. He.. I can't describe it well, I only saw him and his expression for a moment.. But he seemed... out of it. Like.. you know back then when he got possessed by Cara? Oh right.. You weren't there.. But that's besides the point. I just—" said Rhida before the door behind them bursts open and it's Mijo with a sword.

"Hello there..! It's me! Mijo! Your favorite swordsman! Now, let me.." said Mijo in a maniacal voice as he closed the door behind him. "There we go. Now, now.. Oh hi Rhida! Didn't expect you to be here, I wasn't expecting an advanced reunion.. Well, I suppose that won't matter. After this, I don't think you'd want to meet me anymore..!" said Mijo, as he pointed the sword at them.

Jomi and Rhida widened their eyes as Jomi put herself between Mijo and Rhida. "What are you planning..? I.. don't want you to keep hurting Mijo, but.. please put the sword down. Whatever you do, please.. don't do it the sword way." said Jomi, as she prepared her own sword as Rhida stayed behind, keeping her mouth shut to see how the confrontation unfolds. 

"I.. realized does it matter if I hurt them physically when I already hurt them mentally? I know your usual musings about me.. Oh he's isolating.. Oh he's cold.. He's too emotional.. Oh what happened to him? Oh he's not himself, I've gotta fix him. Discipline him until he's obedient.. Hahaha!!! I am tired of acting like I don't mind it, trying to keep my mouth so quiet.. But sitting there.. just *SEEMS TO AMPLIFY IT?!!?*" said Mijo as he clashed blades with Jomi.

"Mijo!" said Rhida and Jomi, as Jomi and Mijo continued pressing their blades to each other. "Pointless. If I wanted you to die, you would've already been." said Mijo, as he pressed his blade harder, the material on both blades struggling to keep up. "Mijo..! Stop..! You can express this in different ways!" said Jomi before Mijo smiled and teleported them to a different area.

Rhida gasped as they were teleported outside of Jomi's bedroom. "W—where did they go..? Wait..! I think I know the exact place.." said Rhida as she hurriedly ran out and headed to the training ground.

_Training ground_

"Fight me! Fight me..!!" said Mijo as they clashed blades, both are holding back their strength, for different reasons. "What's with you, Jomi? Can't go hard on your friend? Well, I'm not your friend anymore!" said Mijo as he intensified his assault. "Stop..! Eventually, you're going to do something you'll regret!" said Jomi as she continued to keep up with Mijo, trying her best not to harm him. "My regrets? Like I had any more I can add..! At least this time, it's not just.. someone's opinions and feelings that personally hurt me, this time.. **_I will be responsible, and there's no doubt about that._**" said Mijo as he managed to deflect an attack from Jomi and pin her to a wall.

Mijo is using an energy sword against Jomi's throat as she looks at him, pleading. "Mijo.. Please.. I understand your pain, your hatred.. I try to.. at least. You don't really want to do this, do you? I can see the conflict.. You.. just want to express yourself without judgement.. I do too.." said Jomi as Mijo visibly is shaken but keeps the sword at her throat. "Abusing my goodwill to you.. This is what people think whenever they hear about what I have done to you this afternoon. But, honestly..? I haven't cared in a while." said Mijo as he pressed it at Jomi's throat, making her bleed a bit. The fear and concern on Jomi's eyes is palpable, while Mijo's maniacal face is hiding whatever he's truly thinking.

"Mijo! Stop this right now. I.. will have no choice but to stop you, to prevent you from hurting Jomi and yourself, again." said Rhida sternly, as she held up her ice sword and seems to be casting something. Mijo chuckled as he used the sword to cut the neckline of Jomi's dress, exposing her bra a bit. He moved to cut the straps of the bra as well before making a huge cut on the skin of her top, before pushing her down. "Mijo..?" said Jomi as she held her arms close to her chest, due to the exposure and bleeding. "Now.. time to reveal my secret~" said Mijo as he took off his jacket right in front of the two, revealing his own cuts to his arms. 

The two were immediately shocked at the revelation as he moved his head around, preparing himself for something. "Mijo..! What did you do?!" said Jomi in reaction to his self-harm as well as what he did to her. "Mijo..! I.. what..?" said Rhida as she lowered her weapon for a bit, she was in shock of what Mijo did to himself. "I know what you're thinking.. Oh how terrible, you're hurt..! But, I'm not here to get your sympathy. It's all fake anyway. Guilt me all you want. Fine. Add on to this scar-filled body. We'll see how much it can take, how much wounds it can add before it breaks, and I bleed until I die." said Mijo as he looked at his arms, then to the two.

Jomi stood up, picking up her blade as he moved to Rhida's side, still holding her dress up to not be completely exposed. "Jomi..! Did he.." trailed off Rhida as she is very conflicted on what to think of Mijo. "Yeah.. D—dont worry.. please, I.. know this looks horrible, even depraved coming from Mijo, but.. I don't think he does this to me, without reason.. Hold on, I'll heal myself. You.. talk to him, keep him sane, just for a little while longer." explained Jomi as she casts a spell to heal and repair her clothes.

"Okay.. Mijo..?" said Rhida, as she held her sword again at Mijo. "Mmm.. I heard it. And you know what? Maybe I am just a depraved insane psychopath hidden beneath my façade.. Maybe this is just the real me, have you ever thought about that, Rhida?" said Mijo, as he held his sword at Rhida too. "I.. know this isn't you. At least, not the healthy you. I know you've always been self-destructive, self-sacrificial and a person with empathy to other people.. I just.. think that you lost your care somewhere in the way of our life.." said Rhida, as Mijo widnened his eyes and smiled. "I lost that? Hmm.. keen eye. I knew you were observing me even without my input. Ah well, too late." said Mijo as he starts to feel the effects of his self-harm, feeling hazy and numb to his surrounndings.

"Whew.. I need to finish this." said Mijo as he charged his sword and attacked Rhida. She tried to dodge then block his attack, but Mijo was quick and managed to shatter her ice sword, and put her down to the floor. "Now, let me finish this destruction of my social and love life, once I hurt you, you will never love me again." said Mijo as he used his sword to threaten and cut Rhida's dress, revealing her almost naked body underneath. "That's enough." said Mijo, before he smiled at Rhida then teleported away.

_Jomi's Castle Balcony, overlooking Dajovy City_

"Well.. well.. Mijo, you've done it! You've ruined your only lifeline, what now? Kill yourself?" said Mijo to himself, as he looked at his sword. "I wish.. But, I'm not sure if I would be able to be revived after I kill myself. And I don't want to attempt something I'm not a one hundred percent sure guranteed death. Maybe there's a part of me that wants to live, I just don't know if they have good intentions." responded Mijo to himself, as he caresses the blade, tempted to switch to the sharp end.

"Can you really go back here? Especially to Rhida, you hurt her. If Jomi doesn't at least not look at you the same sane way.. That's a win." questioned Mijo as he put the blade at his throat. "I need.. more power. But not here. I need to get out and start asserting myself. Hurt everyone on the way if it means I don't add on to the pain." continued Mijo as he further ran the blade through his skin, the blunt end. He needs to at least keep his arms functional for any interruption.

"I really need to sleep.." murmured Mijo to himself, as he looked at his phone he left here before going to Jomi. It was 00:10, late at midnight. "Huh, must've been a while since I confronted the two. About.. five hours ago? Anyways, no one except those two know, the problems remain.. I just.. hope tomorrow.. will be better." said Mijo, his clarity showing and mania fading due to his mental exhaustion. "See you, Dajovy, the dark world, Jomi.. and Rhida. You'll hate me, but.. soon, you'll forget." said Mijo, before he left Jomi's Castle Balcony.

_Next day, morning, Rhida is sitting on a bench at the gymnasium, looking at the fellow students around her_

'Mijo.. I don't know what to feel about you..' thought Rhida as she looked at Mijo, looking off somewhere else. 'W—what you did..? I.. didn't think you would be capable of such acts..' continued Rhida as she looked at her body. 'I still remember.. your sadistic look.. It wasn't.. I.. don't believe it's you. But, for my own safety.. I think Jomi should.. you wouldn't kill her right?' Rhida was tapped on the shoulder by her friend, Diminaque. "Hey, look at that guy, amazing right?" said Diminaque, to a random male student at the stage, acting his heart out for a school film viewing promotion.

"Oh, yeah.. Haha..!" said Rhida, as she chuckled a bit. 'These times.. I have good friends, good grades.. But, I'm just... worried about him. I don't want him to fall.. to the abyss. Well, I'll just have to see later, I have to go to that meeting, as well as practice that speech.." thought Rhida, as she looked at Mijo and sighed.

_Later, at 16:00, Mijo visits Jomi's Castle, he arrives at Jomi's bedroom_

"I'm here. Don't be scared. Or be scared.. Just.. don't kick me out. I know you want to talk to me." said Mijo, to Jomi's bedroom door. "Come in. But promise not to.. undress me, okay? You know it's a horrible action, that's why you did it." said Jomi, as Mijo opened the door and closed it, seeing a Jomi in her usual pajamas, with some books lying around.

"You want me to say I'm sorry, don't you?" asked Mijo as he sat down beside Jomi. "Yeah. But, what about it? Don't you feel apologetic?" retorted Jomi, as Mijo looked away and nodded. "Yeah, whatever. I know it was a horrible act. I knew it would.. hurt you two. Something unforgivable to validate my own self-hatred." said Mijo as he looked at his arms. "I intentionally didn't heal these. Why would my pain matter? It's been hurting inside mentally for a while now.. Why would physical pain be any worse? Of course, I still have to keep up the façade outside, so that's why cuts are the best for this." commented Mijo, as he touched his arms, making him recoil a bit.

"Is it visible outside, as in.. the light world, or only here?" asked Jomi, as Mijo laughed at her. "Of course not visible. I hide my pain as much as I can, okay? But.. even if that's the case, everywhere I go, the mental instability remains the same." said Mijo, as he covered up his arms using Jomi's blanket. "I know you're not fine. But, if anyone else asks you, are you good?" questioned Jomi, as she put her hand on his shoulder.

"No.. I should.. say no. But, I'm scared of just trying to explain why. I.. don't want to be the center of attention, but.. I also want validation. The reason I'm.. just comfortable with you, and Rhida now.. is because I know you won't resent me forever. That might be too late now though.. for Rhida.." answered Mijo, as he shed a tear. 

"I.. get it. I mean, I'm a princess right? So I gotta maintain this sense of beauty, courteousness and strong will to manage the country without many enemies.. But, it's been exhausting, so I try to truly display myself, as just that, myself. But, of course.. not everyone likes me, so.. there's always judgement.. But, I have you, the Dark Pearl, and my close royal court. Do you have anyone you think you can be comfortable like this? Except me, of course." said Jomi, as Mijo shook his head.

"I say that I do, but.. that would be lying. I would be lying if I said I was comfortable with sharing these emotions of mine. I'm not. In fact, I have to be sure that today I won't collapse and break down.." said Mijo, as he laid his head on her shoulder. "I.." trailed off Jomi, as she stroked his hair. "I don't want you to feel sympathy for a guy who forcefully undressed two girls. I'm just looking for someone to actually understand and help me.. But no one will." said Mijo, as his tears started to fall.

"N—no one will..?" asked Jomi, as Mijo looked at her and sadly nodded. "I.. don't want to feel like this. Like I'm so spoiled and ungrateful for what I have that I expect more from everyone around me.. But.. I just wished that they understood that I'm.. different." continued Mijo, as he wiped his tears. "I don't want to be different.. But I am..! I can't change who I am like that! I'm just.. so powerless, helpless! It's so sad." said Mijo, as he held his arm and pressed on it, making it bleed out. 

"Mijo!" exclaimed Jomi as she stopped his arms, causing more bleeding since his entire arms are covered in scars. "Heal it if you must. I don't really value my life surviving until the next day. Of course, I have stuff I want to do before dying, but.. if I didn't even have a choice in my school life, who's to say I'd ever get there?" commented Mijo, as he leaned his body over to Jomi, while she healed the scars. "I have to. You cannot stay like this, beaten, broken and scarred. If I have to help you heal, so be it. You've stuck out for me at my lowest, so I should do the same." declared Jomi, as she uses the rest of her magic to continue healing Mijo, while Mijo lays down on her bed. After a while of intense magic use from Jomi, Mijo's scars finally heal as Jomi stops, breathing heavily.

"That.. I had to exert a lot.. A lot of it was deep.. Haha.. This.. means a lot, doesn't it, Mijo?" said Jomi, as Mijo nodded. "Yeah. Well, I already feel better. Thanks. I.. genuinely thank you." responded Mijo as he hugged her. "I.. you're.. no problem. I'm always here, for you. No matter how low we both go, we're here for each other right? We can't abandon each other, and we won't. Remember that." said Jomi as Mijo nodded and patted her back for a bit before they pulled back.

"I.." trailed off Mijo, before finally breaking down in front of Jomi. "I just.. it's.. been a while since I heard someone.. care about **me.**" said Mijo, as he carefully put away his sword and started hitting the mattress using his fists. "All I wanted.. is for someone.. anyone to hear me out. I don't need you and your advice.. I just want someone to care.. and.. I'm contradictory, aren't I?" continued Mijo, as he looked at Jomi, heavily breathing. "I.. want someone to care but I don't to be **judged?!** What is that, do I just want someone like **me?!** Incapable of speaking out and standing up for himself, and scared and fearful of my every **move?!**" shouted Mijo, as he smacked his head into one of Jomi's pillows.

"Haha.. It's like I am those rock artists.. Of course, I don't want to say that I had the same issues as these people but.. I get it. I get what they felt, the pain, the fame, the depression... All of it. I just.. I feel the same way about how alienated and disconnected I am from my school work sometimes, and like being forced to do a lot of the shit that I resent.. It's all of that, building endlessly until I die. The suicide option seems.. something only cornered people would do. I see two ways, and both end in isolation and with the intention to disappear." said Mijo, as he calmed himself down.

"Mijo.." said Jomi as she put her hand on her shoulder. "One, numbing myself to the pain and taking every opportunity to get some dopamine into my brain causing delirious euphoria.. or.. being so deep in lost memories that keep playing in a dark room that you eventually break and spiral.. These are the only two paths." said Mijo, as he looked visibly weary. 

"It's.. not. But, I.. see it in your eyes.. We're tired. It looks impossible now, or that the paths you see lead nowehere.. There's always a way.. to change. Even if all hell broke loose once again, if you live.. that's enough... Because, you'll get your way soon. Time is for you, and.. even if you die tomorrow? At least you would've died fighting. There's nothing else you can do anyway." said Jomi, as her eyes are half closed. "I'll think about that. Thank you again, Jomi." said Mijo before they hugged and went their separate ways for now.

_Next day, 19:00, in front of Jomi's bedroom_

"Hey, it's me again." said Mijo, as Jomi opened the door. "Oh.. hi! Come in, I just finished my work for today." said Jomi as Mijo went inside and closed the door. Mijo sat down and laid on her bed. "I'm so tired.." said Mijo as he looked around him. "Yeah, Rhida told me the whole school is busy this week, and the next week.. the next week.. exams.. yeah, the next two weeks aren't going to be exactly a walk in the park for you.. Though your walks in the park aren't even full of leisure,.. haha.." responded Jomi, as Mijo nodded in agreement. "Yep.. I'm probably not going to stop going here.. The events that have happened and that will happpen are going to impact me in a way that I need you.." said Mijo, as Jomi smiled and tilted her head.

"That's good to hear. Anyways, how's your healing journey?" asked Jomi, as Mijo shook his head. "Not going well. I'm grateful you're here, but.. like what I said before, way back.. As long as the trauma is still affecting me through the event still recurring then there is really nothing I can do but endure and try to survive." said Mijo, as he stroked his hair. "I.. understand. Have you decided on what to do today?" questioned Jomi as she stretched her legs and arms. "No.. But, Jomi.. there's just so much to do...! I.. have realized that I wasted my time.. no. I realize that.. either way I am screwed. I either freeze in one spot and don't enjoy myself, have fun but sacrifce school work, or do school work but my fun is ruined for the night, and I struggle to do it." said Mijo as he coughed a bit.

"I see.. yeah, we've talked about it before. Still what do you hope to change? It's about time you do it now, at least.. before you are forced to do it, anyway." questioned Jomi, as she played with her hair. "I.. don't even know anymore.. If I try to change, it's constantly bogged down by myself and the others around me.. The worst part is.. like before, it has always been cyclical. It's this cycle of pain that I have developed a sense of fear and deep mental stress.." answered Mijo, as he took off his glasses and buried his face into his hands. "Oh.. yeah. Before I met you, when me and Cara were in an abusive relationship with self-destructive goals of maintaining dominance.. Thinking about it, I just accepted the fact that I was always going to hurt, that Cara would be forever in my life.. She even decided to make a schedule that revolved around her pleasure in making me do a lot of things.. that I prefer not to be mentioned today. But, I don't want to make this about me, as you've already heard about it, the point is.. I get it." explained Jomi as she rubbed her hands together.

"Haha.. Even throughout the worlds.. You're really the only one who can get me.. fully understand me.. It makes sense. I guess, after seeing you and helping you before and during the first catacylsm.. It.. really put into perspective on how similar people's journey are through their life, even if not directly.. You are an obvious example, but.. as long as I accept that.. people can be different and have a different perspective on their life and experience.. Then I can be just like you.. like me again." commented Mijo, as he smirks and looks at Jomi. "From the most degenerate and depraved acts.. You understand. I hope others are.. as good as you.." added Mijo before he looked to the ceiling and took a huge sigh. "Thank you, Mijo." said Jomi as they hug together. They held tightly for a while before pulling back and waving goodbye to each other again.
