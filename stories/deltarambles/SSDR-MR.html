## Gacha Procrastinación

### Author's Note:

Can you tell where I found the will to write this? Well, it's pretty simple. If Honkai: Star Rail can ruin my late evening, so will I too. Everything here is fictionalized of course, but is based on some true feelings and topics I felt willed enough to write.

Oh, and the reasons for like the specification of Mizo and Rika, the names was because I was writing this as I sent it over to help get opinions on it, you know, stuff.

Edit 1: Fully change to Third person limited pov, focusing on Mizo. | Apr 30, 2025 | 19:30

"Ugh.. I am so.. tired right now.. So much work I did earlier duuude.. And I had to face the teachers like I didn't know that I was already late in passing my tasks.. Like, seriously..! Three performance tasks..! I.. just can't.. justify how.. I just.. misplaced the time that was required, like seriously.. I am so disappointed at myself for being so indulgent, not realizing the impending occurrence of my life.. I know, I know.. You're suffering too, but I swear, even you can just.. just.. pass some of them on time, while I have barely passed the 3 I needed to do.. since last week..!" Riza said, frustrated and also clearly agitated.

"Haha.. yeah.. Um.. I get it. But, if I may ask, what's the progress..?" Mizo asked her, but Rika was clearly a bit agitated but restrained herself from saying anything before responding;

"Oh you know, nothing. Barely a draft for that essay, barely a scrap of drawing for that comic task, and especially only a concept for that brochure.. Don't even ask, you know." she said, rolling her eyes.

"I.. yeah. But, you know.. I just, want to check up sometimes..?" Mizo says, as Rika sighs and brushes her hair before turning to face him, with an annoyed yet regretful face.

"Did you know, what I spent my time doing instead..? Play this stupid video game where I sit around and do puzzles for 50% of the time, auto combat 20% and you know what.. almost all of them have this.. this long ass fucking dialogues with more yapping than one girl can handle in one night..! You wanna know the worst part? I DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING.. COMPLETE IT! I WAS STUCK ON THIS.. this boss, spoilers.. but this guy's pretty strong, and when I tried to fight it, I realized one thing. You need the new characters, with their builds ready, even just the DPS to beat that boss. Unless you want to suffer finding out why that's the case, take my advice." she continued, before slumping on the chair, adjusting her glasses as she took deep breaths, while he processed what she said.

"I haven't.. played through that yet.. I just pulled because I wasn't that interested in for the reruns.. and well, I got the banner character. Only barely made it through, like around the.. Okhema arc..?" Mijo said, as she looked up at me and smiled menacingly.

"Okhema huh.. When you just arrived.. hmm?" She said, before standing up and looking at me intensely. "Don't be an idiot like me. Realize that the 10 hour gameplay isn't lying. There is more yapping that's going to happen. You're lucky you have the previous pulls. I had to go around for.. 7 HOURS! Combined. In a span of two nights, to get the character. Be gracious in your luck, Mizo." She said, as she crossed her arms and looked away.

"Alright alright.. Yeah, I.. don't spend much time in these games anyway, gotta write and all. So if you're procrastinating with gacha games, I'm procrastinating on my novel which will never be seen by anyone..!" Mizo says, with a smile, feeling a bit ashamed by advertising his novel.

"Yeah yeah, your novel. Cool writer, learnt to use it on research?" She said as Mizo looked at her with an amused expression. "Hitting hard I see, want me to remind you what you just said to me..?" Mizo says, forming a sly smile.

"Psssh. Shush it then. Now, before I forget, help me figure this fucking essay." She said, dragging him to the chair next to her and making me look at her newly opened up laptop screen, with barely any words on a document, then she scrolled down, revealing rants about the gacha game, then the story they were supposed to review, then her parents before it stopped to show a singular huge image of the word 'The' with elegant writing.

"Here's where we start." She says.


## Thy Night

### Author's Note:

I don't know if this is related but, it gotta be here because it's something I'm explorin'

By the way, the perspective, it's from a character's viewpoint. Not me.

Edit 1: Yes, I'm redoing some parts, I want to get summary and lore, for more.. detailed writing. You'll see why. | Apr 30, 2025 | 19:59

"You know, I never understand the appeal of tight clothes.. I mean, they're just so uncomfortable to wear y'know.. And and besides, if you're going outside, best bet you'll be freezing or melting depending on time of year..! Worst part is, they often show everything your body's gotta offer, and you know, I'm not as.. uh.. pretty as other girls, you get me.. Those girls that somehow stay thin during high school even with all the stress..! When I'm in my baggy and large shirts and pants because of my height.. and ugh.. weight, I think somehow it just.. well I don't think about it but you know, especially during that school party we had, I had an all dark blue pants, polo, fedora hat and blue sling bag! But when I saw the other girls, dresses, purses.. Yeah, that's why I was so focused at drinking the soft drinks they sold.. Gets?"

Mizo said, "Yeah, but I don't see how that'll affect your enjoyment. I.. uh.. was busy with others, so I only saw you occasionally buying and drinking cold soft drinks, looking off to wherever happened to be interesting.. You even messaged to me about reading that book you got in your exchange gift while the stage was speaking about something, you said you got bored after a while but didn't want to waste anything so uh.. you drank.. like last time."

"Mhm. I.. ugh. Just, look.. Even if you know, what I know.. Sitting together on that night seemed icky to me. You, boy, and me, girl.. Even if we're supposedly only best friends and are sibling-like.. I'm.. just saying..! Hey, you didn't tell me what you did by the way... This is the first convo we're having since you blacked out on my messages.."

Mizo responded with; "What..? I.. just said.. that I was pretty tired.."

Rika responded, "Uhuh.. But I did see you standing there talking to your make friends, so obviously.. you still weren't tired that time, even if it was close to closing.."

Mizo said, "What..? I thought you already left.. um.."

She said, "Yeah, I messaged you saying I was leaving, not that I left. Look, I don't care about that, but it's obvious that you ignored me during that time."

Mizo said, "It slipped out of my mind.. Shucks.. Sorry, then."

She responded, "Nevermind about that. It was dumb of me to assume you weren't busy all night.."

"I.." Mizo looked away after this, processing her words. She was about to continue, but then stopped too, stuttering before going on her phone and going farther to a nearby seat.

"Why.. did.. she.. why is she so.. clingy? I don't.. Should I.. I.. this is so much.. Damn.. I gotta face her at least, but what response..?" Mizo thought to himself, eventually turning to face her, using her phone.

"Hey Rika." (Rika was her name) Mizo called out, before she looked up at me and was clearly annoyed and almost glaring at me. "What..? Mizo?" She said, clearly with a hint of annoyance in her voice (Mizo's my name)

"I.. want to just.." Mizo mustered the courage to say it. "Apologize.. It's all I can do."

"Apologize.. huh?" She said, as silence appears between us.

"Don't..  be like this, Rika. I just.. didn't.. I was.. just.. making some other connections, you understand.. right..? We talked about how.. it'd be better if we tried to talk with other people." Mizo said, as Rika stayed silent, opening her mouth to speak, but mumbling something then stopping as she pressed her phone closer to her chest.

"Mizo." She says as she puts away her phone. "Let's go." 

She stands up and drags me, then we walked to an arcade, she then spoke up, "Let's just have fun." she said, with a seemingly hurt tone, but trying to hide it.

And well, we tried to at least, we went to a bunch of machines, we started with;

"Ooh! The mini ice hockey thing, let's do that." Mizo says, as we then go and grab some play coins that totalled to around 50 then we started playing.

It went pretty well, after the mini ice hockey thing, they went to the basketball one, the driving one, the shoot-em-up one, then final, the vr shooting one, after that they ran out then raced each other to a milkshake tapo drink store. Mizo ordered iced coffee with pearls. Then Rika looked at Mizo, as she listed out the options and was shaking him. She eventually chose the matcha one with pearls and a lot of sugar and iced tea. They sat down and this is the convo that followed;

Mizo was panting as they sat down on some fake grass in an indoor park in a mall, and she said, "Well.." 

"Well.. what?" Mizo asked, as he patted her shoulder. 

"Well, wasn't that fun..?" She asked, with a smile that seemed genuine.

"Yeah.." Mizo said, drinking some coffee.

"Yeah. It is. Now.." She said, drinking her coffee then turned to him, staring directly into my eyes.

"Mizo. I.. don't.. wish to.. strain anything. I.. don't.. want to lose you, like.. earlier. I know.. I might be a little.. well.. clingy.. But, I just.. want you to know, I.. won't just.. leave like that, okay..? I know you have your own.. stuff to do, and I have mine.. Just, remember me sometimes.. okay?" She said, as she gently touched my hand and looked at me intensely.

"Oh, um.. I will.. then. Haha.. Promise." I say, as we do a pinky promise, then we awkwardly hugged and pulled back quickly, I couldn't see.. but I think she was embarrassed too.

We just chatted and drinked after that.. That's the end.

## Dreadful Memories 

### Author's Note:

You can tell who I based this off. Anyway, another story. I'm starting to from this on out, this is now a spinoff of deltarambles. This is not an alternate timeline though, more of a story that happens in a larger one. Who knows? They might get some cameos, but.. for now, they're just the vaguely high school pair going through life, without the big magic and world ending events in their head.

Maybe just indulgent, but I'm willing to write until I don't want to, and that's the freedom I've been missing with the main deltarambles story. Longer plot points are good, but they do take a considerable amount of time now, even with a more fast writing.

Mizo was walking, when he saw her, Rika. Mizo walked up to her to greet her but he stopped himself when he saw she wasn't in her usual cheesy tomboy-ish happiness, she was more of the depressed one. "You're here." She says.

"I'm.. here. Yes." Mizo says, Mizo tries to gauge her reaction but she seemed to stay in that exact neutral face, with a hint of sadness. "Sometimes, all someone needs is a little push. But, what if you've been pushed too far..?" She asks as Mizo looks at her and answers, "I... don't know, do you?" She nodded and sighed as she brushed her hair then got some water and drank it.

"Then.." She grabbed me then moved me to a more secluded area and now looked more agitated, frustrated and sleep-deprived.

"Then let me show you how much I hate myself. I haven't tried harming myself.. more, but it does feel.. intense but.. exhilarating yes? Hate. It's a strong word yes? Shows me how much self-loathing I've built. The only thing I could think of is **HOW STUPID OF ME TO BELIEVE IN OTHER PEOPLE.** How.. naive. When, I should believe in myself. Look where that got me. **LOOK AT IT.**" She slightly shows signs of bruising just below her neck, then shows off slight cuts at her lower abdomen.

"Tell me how much hope you can *lose* before you break? Tell me how much fake *masking* you can do until you decide to do what's the only thing keeping you from not existing.. Your self-hatred of one's *cowardice.*" She said, their faces intensely close, she is almost pressing him to a wall, while she still looks angry and desperate.

"Rika..! You're getting too close for comfort.. I'll.. help, just not like this.." Mizo says, before she chuckled before pulling back. "Why would I expect help when **this** is how I treat people? Even my *best friend..?*" She said to herself, with a bitter smile.

"Huh..? A—at least you reach out.. By reaching out to me.. at least, you can—" Mizo is cut off by a sudden lurch of her towards him, her hands about to touch me before she turned away and looked away, heavily breathing, her hair now more tangled.

"Haha.. haha...." She laughs while she grabs her phone. "Hard work will pay off..? Huh, what a shame your *stupid* quote doesn't work out in **reality**." She closes it then turns to him. "Yeah, I want to be successful, sure. But, not like this. I'm.. not just some random girl to be a **cog in the machine.** But, I am sure **you** don't care either way. **Die** in the system, or be **cursed** out into the unknown of life, maybe you'll find your success in the annals of **history**, or not and **just** die. Your **choice**." She responds to an unknown person.

"Isn't that the messages from the stage during the usual Monday school ceremony earlier..? What.. made you save them?" Mizo asked, as she smiled. "Cycle.. Cycle..! Yeah. I remember that. **Wasting time?!** Wasting time..! I would rather **die** than continue to **live** like this. But, I can't. A coward's way out. Suck it up and live in a **jar**." She said, somewhat to him and to the unknown person.

Rika goes silent and starts playing, 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' by Nirvana. "What is.. wrong with me.. Why do I think, I think.." While she grabs some water to drink, completely ignoring him. Mizo understood what she wanted by this and so stepped away and sat close enough to where he can see her, but not too close.

After a while, she stopped at the last 'What is wrong with me?' from the song then stood up and walked to her guitar she brought to the park they were staying at, and looked at him like she wanted to make him follow, so he did. They went to her house, and entered, her parents were out until the night, and this was right around 16:00, so they just sat at her living room and she brought out the guitar then after a few adjustments and tuning, she started to play the guitar cover of 'You Know You're Right' by Nirvana, while singing the lyrics with her phone slowly scrolling it nearby, while he listened.

As she sang the song, Mizo felt quite relieved but worried at the same time, she even hit the notes perfectly, at least in her voice, he can see her tears start to form. But what stood out for him is she changed all the references to a 'she' to a 'he' in her cover of it, afterwards she turned off the guitar and just started crying right there, in front of him, while grabbing a handkerchief and covering her face from him. Mizo silently patted her back as she did it, before she hugged him and he hugged her.

## You Know You're Right

## Author's Note:

The title means exactly what it means.

Oh boy, this one was interesting to write. Let's just say very deep and heavy topic of self harm will come up.

"Hey..." She said, as she was looking off to the distance of their school balcony. "Yeah? Got anything to share today?" Mizo asked, as she chuckled and turned to me, with an eerie smile. "I got just the *thing.*" She said before suddenly taking a razor blade and using it on her lower neck area. He tried to stop her but she pushes him away and gets a small cut, she then wipes the blood using a yellow handkerchief then she pressed on her wound using her hand as he went to pull her away.

"**Stop.** ***Stop.*** I need to do this." She says as they fight over her wound, she gets increasingly rough to match his adrenaline pumping moves to prevent her from hurting herself. "No! I won't." Mizo continued to try and stop her, as she is visibly tearing up due to how much she's pressing on the wound while also trying to push him away. "**Please..!!**" She manages to shove me back as she spreads her blood nearby the wound accidentally, while she gets her handkerchief to dry off her tears.

"Rika..?" Mizo asks, as she quivers while crying into her blood stained handkerchief, while the wound is now somewhat good now, it's still scarred, but now it's starting to heal. "Get away from **me**, *now!*" She said, turning back in shame.

"I can't.. *go.* I need you to be safe, **Rika**." Mizo says, as they notice a teacher walking by and he quickly hid her and acted like they were about to kiss, to hide her pretty obvious wound. She tensed up, but she didn't make a move as she knew doing anything would be more.. *concerning.*

The teacher noticed us and he nodded to Mizo as he passed through. They both pushed each other back as he looked at her and had a faint blush while hovering around her wound a bit.

"W—what..! I.. stop.. why.." Rika turned away as Mizo slowly approached her. "What did you do..?" She says, trembling.

"It was to shield you. I know you don't want anyone else to know." Mizo says, as she looks at him with tired eyes, before stepping back from him again, shaking her head a ton as she hid the razor blade and handkerchief back.

"I—I'm leaving." She says turning to run but he grabs her shoulder. "No. Not until your promise me not to hurt yourself anymore." Mizo says, with a serious face.

"*Please..*" She tries to wrestle him away but he remain steadfast. "Promise me. I don't want to see you hurt. Even by yourself." Mizo says, as she shakes her head. "Yes.. yes..! Okay! Fine..! You're right. I should.. I shouldn't do.. this. *You know you're right..*" Rika says as she starts shaking more while keeping her head down.

Silence fills the hallway as a fellow student, a friend of theirs was walking when she saw us and quickly rushed to us, noticing Rika's crying. "Kari..?" Rika says while Mizo looks at her, a bit worried.

"Rika..? Mizo..? What happened here..?" She asks, while I contemplate.

"Kari... I.. uh.." Rika shoves him in hopes to make Mizo answer instead. "Huh..? Hey..! It's.. this is your issue. I'm not—" She looked up at him and did her best puppy eyes face as Kari looks on in confusion. "Fine. But, don't expect anything.. okay..?" He says more gently.

"What..? One moment Rika was crying her heart out, now she's just.. I don't know.. begging? clinging?" Kari says as Rika turns away, likely in shame. "I don't know. Okay..?" Mizo composed himself, before he tried explaining what happened.

"Okay.. so.. Rika here... decided to.." Mizo looks at Rika, now shaking a bit as she is clearly listening but is still looking away. "...harm herself. Luckily, I stopped her before the bleeding got worse. Then we.. umm.. well, faced together when a teacher was going around and the best thing I thought would be to position her to a kiss. Obviously, we wouldn't, and didn't. Trust me on this one." He explains, as Kari gets progressively more concerned, while Rika held her arms around herself and was clearly trembling.

"So.. she.. wow." Kari says, while she looks like she's thinking while Rika turns around and hugs Mizo tightly. "Hey..!! Hey..?" He says, as I see her eyes about to burst with tears while her mouth was being forced closed while she held on to me tightly.

"Mizo..? Are you sure you two are just.. best friends..?" Kari asks, as Mizo shakes his head. "I don't know. But, what matters more is her safety. She.. she needs help. I just don't know if she can get one." Mizo says, as Rika tightened further and started digging her nails into my polo. "I understand.. I just.. Okay, I knew she was going through a lot, didn't speak to me, and.. well.." Kari looks at Rika's disentangled and messy hair covering her back uniform. "She never does this. The self harm part I mean. We all have our own problems.." Mizo responds as Kari nods and pats Rika's back as she stiffens and Kari instantly pulls back.

"Um.. Okay, this.. I.. was not prepared for this. Um, I have to go now though. See you, you two." Kari says and waves at them before leaving. As soon as Kari leaves, Rika instantly pulls back from the hug and with intense shaking. "T—thank you." She says as she grabs her things. "I.. promise. I just need some time alone. Do.. do you trust me.. no. Will you trust me again..?" She asked, as she looked at him with unintentionally desperate and needy eyes. A long silence followed, Mizo needed to make sure what he say won't make her situation worse.

"Forget about it. I know you'll just say 'No'. I'm still going. It's going to be night." She says, before getting her things and leaving alone. "I.. wait..!" Mizo called out, but she ignored me and continued to walk, he considered catching up but he stopped myself as she disappeared around a corner, leaving me alone.

## Chained Soul

## Author's Note:

"Let you live alone, in the world you have in place."

"You live your life like it's so easy and there's no meaning, but you don't know it's the calm before the storm. So, I play along."

"Do you want to know what.. my life has been.. Mizo..? Let me show you." She said, before she dragged me to her bedroom. It has a distinct pink and black contrast, her books and computer being mostly silver and charcoal black while her room and bed was with pastel pink and purple. "I don't.. want to wait for tomorrow." She says as she enables the laptop to start booting up, while she sits down at a barely functional swivel chair. Mizo also noticed that her red floor was collapsing and had concrete showing. "I don't want to take it to the limit.. 'cause I'm already in it.. I can't make it better.. I.." She shuddered before she jumped to her bed. "..**surrender**."

Mizo is trying to process what she's saying when her laptop finished booting and she immediately sprung up and went to it. Mizo saw that she went to her documents, then recordings. "I don't record. This is.. more of a diary." She says as she clicks on one titled 'AKAHSHHSJHWWJWBWKSJEBDB'. "That's quite a long.. name." Mizo commented before the markdown text file loaded. Here is the contents;

<details><summary>'AKAHSHHSJHWWJWBWKSJEBDB'.md</summary><md-block>

She looked at it absent mindedly, like she was processing what she was doing when she wrote the note down. "This is.. when..?" She looked at the file's details, it was just three days ago, on a monday. Middle of the night, 3:00. "Oh god." She says as she sits down in a chair swiveling it around as Mizo tries to come up with words to say.

"What.." She repeated to herself, while she further made her rotation quicker while holding her head. "I.." Rika looks at Mizo and jumps at him and faints, landing in his body very awkwardly.

"Rika..! Rika..?" Mizo called out, but she was completely out, her face was relaxed now and almost seemingly put her weight on mine. He gently patted her head and slowly carried her to her bed nearby. "I.. don't know if you need medical.. assistance.. I just hope you feel better, okay?" Mizo says to her unconscious self before leaving the room quietly, not before turning off her laptop and lights.

## Love Buzz

## Author's Note:

Taking a small break from the heavy emotions of these 'chapters' to pivot to more heavy emotions [this time can you guess..? ;) ] that are less.. into the depths of the abyss of people's worst emotions and turmoil. I can never complete the long ones so this short one is a lil' treat.. :D

"Come on..! You're taking your time, huh?!" She says as Mizo calmly mops the floor of their classroom. "Shut up, you're not even an assigned cleaner today, and you think you can do better, _woman?"_ Mizo retorted before she threatened to dirty the undried floor he just mopped. "Hey..! Stop.. no..!" Mizo warns as she held her tongue at me. "Behh..! Tu madre es una puta tonto! Como tu!" She says, before Mizo stared into her eyes. "Tu canto es.. tan bueno como.. las uñas en.. la pizarra..!" Mizo says, as she directly steps over the floor to get closer to him.

"Young lady, I cannot—" Mizo says in a formal tone before Rika pushes him to the wall behind him. "What? Where'd that voice go huh?! That bravado.. **show me."** She said, their bodies are very close, but not touching. "You know, if we stay like this, I might just get.. tempted." Mizo says before he winked, and as she processed what he just said, another random student that left her bags appeared on the door and opened it, seeing them very close.

"O—oh..! S—sorry..! Am I interrupting something..?" The student asks, as Mizo looks at Rika, the girl very close in front of him. "W—what?! No..! No!! You are not. I.." said Rika, that girl in front of him is clearly blushing as she moves away from the classroom and goes outside. "Don't.. um.. say anything about that.. okay..?" Mizo asks the student as she smiles and nods. "Oh don't worry, Mizo. My lips are sealed tight. Though, I am not surprised.. do you two have a bond beyond.. friendship?" July (that's her name) asks, as he awkwardly laughed and looked away. 

"Um.. it's not that.. far. Just, umm.. we haven't figured that out yet." Mizo answered, as July got her bags and moved closer. "Well, you better do.. Valentine's coming up after the exam and mid oral defense, if any deadline is to be thought of.. that's what I would say." July moves closer, with a friendly smile. "Why do you care..? Do **you** have a plan for February 14?" Mizo asks as she turns away from him, likely hiding her blush. "I.. have a plan. But, but.. honestly, I'm more interested in you two, see how you develop.." She admits as he turns to face her back. 

"Really..? Your love life is not working out..?" Mizo responded before she chuckled and turned back to me. "Well.. I'd say no. But.. it's been a struggle finding the perfect.. partner." She admits, turning to a more reflective tone. "Well.. yeah." Before Mizo could say anything Rika went back inside and looked at him with a playful annoyance. "Are you still not done?! Talking to girls before you even finish your mopping.." She condemns as July laughs. "I better go now. See you in class tomorrow..!" She says before waving them goodbye.

"What..? Getting jealous are we.." Mizo teases as she glares at me and crosses her arms. "Just finish the damn mopping, Mizo.." Rika then watched him complete my mopping while Mizo had one earbud on to listen to grunge music while he kept his ears ready for anything from her. Although, she kept opening her mouth to say something, then not following through. Until she sighed then asked, "W—what are you listening.. to..?" 

"Nirvana. Specifically, all of Bleach: Deluxe Edition on my phone. Currently, it's.. Floyd the Barber that's playing. The studio version. You're a Nirvana super fan, you should know." Mizo answers as her eyes lighten up. "No way..! Um.. you listen to.. haha.. right.. Um, what's your favorite song on Bleach, the studio recordings..? Mine is Downer." She asks as Mizo smiles and look at her intensely. "About A Girl." 

She immediately got what Mizo was getting at and blushed intensely. "Sh—shut.. really..? That's.. wow.. yeah.. I guess it's a popular one, not really my thing.. For me, even Paper Cuts and Sifting are more.. to my liking." He smiled and turned to mop more. "Meh, I haven't grown to like them. What, is Big Cheese in your top five?" Mizo asks, as he turns to face her, she surprisingly nodded. "Y—yeah. Downer, Scoff, Blew, Negative Creep and.. Big Cheese. My top five." she elaborated.

"Wow.. I guess you must hate Smells Like Teen Spirit?" Mizo asks, knowing of a few common tropes when being a Nirvana fan. "O—oh..! Well, it's not that it isn't a good song.. It's just not my favourite in it.. 'Drain You' is my favourite there, in the Nevermind album." She responded as Mizo smiled and finished mopping and then as he was about to throw out the dirty water used, he looked at her, and they were both near the classroom door very close. Mizo says, "Maybe I'd consider.. being that.. you in that song.." before quickly running away.

She was intensely blushing, but she ran after me, calling out; "H—hey..! Stop flirting, you.. **incessant worm..!**" She caught up with him when Mizo arrived at a utility area. "Hey..! Hey..!" She calls him, while Mizo was panting from exhaustion as I throw the dirty water away. "What.. what's gotten into you..! I.. you know how I feel about this.. Oh, how I long to punch you straight at your manhood.." She continued, while trying to calm herself down.

"Hey.. it's just a bit of teasing, hmm?" Mizo says, as she calms down and looks worried. "I—I get that. But, oh I don't know.. with the blatant ways you flirt with me.. Mizo." She stopped herself as he finished the utility cleaning and looked at her, more seriously. "Are you worried that this.. friendship is more than that..?" Mizo asks, as she hesitates to answer before nodding. "Yeah. Something like that. I.. just.. think I'm not.. fit for you, as a girlfriend.. There's no.. well, it's like siblings, you get me..? I'm grateful for you, and with our bond, it's just. the whole romance and sex thing isn't.. what I want for us." She explained, putting her hands to her chest, near her heart.

Mizo contemplates her words, as he nods. "I get it. I'm used to teasing you about it, but.. never considered if you were.. well, also confused about it like I am. I mean, if someone were to flirt with me like I did to you, I would blush too, y'know." Mizo says as they slowly walked back to their classroom. "So.. are those.." She trails off as he nods. "Yeah, I.. well, wanted to rouse you up more than you do to me. I figured it would be.. well, no I wasn't thinking." Mizo stumbled on his words before he silently continued.

They made it to the room, then they silently cleaned up then locked the room for the night. 

"So.. are we still.." Mizo asks, as she nods. "Yeah? Yeah! We're still going to eat dinner in that fast food restaurant I told you about. Come on, hurry up..!" She responds, before dragging him with her, to run to the super mall nearby.

"Hey. Mizo, what's.. what's on your mind..?" said Rika, as she looked at Mizo staring at my laptop screen with a somewhat unfinished draft of a manuscript of a school research project. "I.. can't.. describe it, it's.. like, you know, so overwhelming.,, just thinking about it." Mizo said, as he fell over to the nearby bed, looking stumped and conflicted. "Um.. Lemme look at this, while I'm not a writer, I should just get a general idea for what your group has been writing.." She continued, before reading the manuscript, silently doing so as she scrolls through it. "Hey.. Mizo..?" She asked again, looking at him holding up a pillow in front of his head.

"What.. I.. just.." Mizo mumbled some incoherent words before stopping. "Hey.. Mizo.." She said, standing up and trying to go near me. I quickly tighten my hold on the pillow while turning away. "Leave." Mizo managed to blurt out, before silently crying. "L—leave..? That's not what we do, Mizo. I.. don't think I need to say what you have told me as well." She responded, as he remained silent, taking off my glasses and wiping my tears away. "Mizo.." She said, getting closer to me, but still hesitant to touch me.

"Go away, Rika. From.. the bottom of my sensitive heart, **leave**." Mizo says, my strained tone makes it obvious now to what he was hiding from her. "I'll just.. close the laptop, gotta buy a new battery, hehe.." She said, awkwardly shuffling away and turning off the laptop, before audibly sighing and walking away from his room.

Mizo composes himself, then he removes the pillow from himself and look at the blank laptop screen with anguish that he can't describe. Mizo sighed too, then turned to where Rika likely went through, the door of my room. "I'm sorry, so much.. But, while I know that my.. reaction was justified, it isn't.. excusable." Mizo told himself, before she suddenly appeared with a neutral expression. "Hey, I got us some food." She said, while staring at him.

"Oh..? Yeah, okay.. What is it..?" Mizo asked, as he got up and approached her. "It's a surprise, pal~" She smiled then dragged him to his kitchen table while covering my eyes. "Surprise..! Not really, though.. haha~!" She says, as she shows him two plates with rice and fried chicken, both have gravy sauce beside them and two drinks of soda about a large size for both of them. "Wow.. where did you order this, huh?" Mizo asked as she looked away from me with a smile and answered, "Just.. delivery service. Thought it would be nice to grab some fast food for today."

"Fast food..? What, you can't co—" Mizo says before a slap on his arm stopped me from finishing. "I can..! Shut up. What, desperate for my cooking or something?" She retorted while he chuckled and said, "Maybe a little, but I suppose this order would do. It's a better chance of eating not burned food, haha.." Mizo says, as she slaps him again in response. "Shut up..! I swear, it's only fun when you're the one being teased.." She says, as she is slightly smiling. "Well, don't throw rocks when living in a glass house~" Mizo says, as she slaps him for the third time. 

"Oh yeah, how about a machine gun huh?" She retorted with spite before Mizo dragged her to her seat and responded, "Suppose I get it, you'd always want a weapon that can backfire." He said, as she wrestled his hands away and looked away, heavily blushing. "Just eat." She says, and he nods and sit down. Mizo starts eating the food and when she notices she starts eating too, looking like she forgot what they were doing just moments ago.

"Okay, okay. Aside from that.. I.. uh, got a few comments on your manu—" She cut herself off, as she shook her head. "Oh.. right. I'm sorry.. for bringing it up if it's so.. um.. traumatic..? For you.. I realize—" She said before Mizo cut her off. "Hold it. I shouldn't make you.. **apologize**." He says before she cut me off. "Hey..! I get it, Mizo.. You don't have to be hard on yourself, I did something I didn't realize—" She said before he cut her off. "No, no.. You wouldn't have realized. Why would you..?" He says, as her breath shuddered.

"I still didn't ask.. if you were still.. comfortable talking about it. For that, I'm **sorry**." She says as Mizo shook his head and held her hand. "**Please**. I.. none.. you.. you don't have.. to. Okay..?" Mizo says, as he held her hand tightly. She tried to say something, but she stuttered before she stopped and she nodded.

"I am.. not.. this.. emotional, really.. but like.. I.. it just brought up bad memories. It's.. so..  confusing.. yet, I can't help.. help but feel a sense of.. dread. I'm.. going to my room. You have the couch and kitchen to yourself. Go to me if you want to sleep, after.. fifteen minutes." Mizo says abruptly, finishing his food and putting it on the sink and leaving, leaving her to process what just happened.

## Get Me?

### Author's Note:

Once again, a new chapter of Rika and Mizo is upon us, while I haven't forgotten about Mijo and DeltaRambles Main, using this as a side-project is good for my mental health, as it allows me to explore more grounded topics, without the complexity of fitting into the magical lore, I'll probably still do the 'vent' spinoffs, I've just run out of ideas to do them differently and creatively.

"You two are going to have to dance together, you two are right around the same height, Mizo's taller, but you're also the tallest girl here, Rika.. So, you're with him. He can't just stand around and do nothing for the transition of the scene, so he'll have to pair with you, only for that moment though, he'll just join the others in the dance choreo for the last part." said July to them, as Riza is immediately shaking her head. "M—Mizo..! No way, no fucking way. Pair me with anyone else but him. Please..!" She asks, but July smiles and responds, "What..? It's just for a moment, and I'm sure your friendship will survive this, and I don't think anybody else can pair with him that isn't awkward either." 

Rika tries to respond, but July is taken away by their other group mates as she turns to him. "What..? Bro, I don't.. I don't.. Um, I'm sorry.. but, I **don't** want to dance with you, not that I take you as a disgusting incel, but rather I really don't want to dance with my male best friend. Especially if it's going to be seen by the entire class batch." She says to him as Mizo nodded and shrugged his shoulders, before he responded, "Welp, nothing we can do about it, really.. You're just going to have to accept it, and the **fallout** from it."

"The **fallout...**" She trails off, as July turns around and says to Rika, "Hey, so.. there's really not much I can do, Mizo is idle anyway after his scene, and since.. everyone will be dancing in the end scene, we'd need to transition nicely, and by having you and him be the second boy to girl pair, makes the acting more easier to do since the song's about a straight girl's hopeless romanticism anyway." July then turns to the main lead and speaks to her, while Riza turns to Mizo again, looking a bit agitated.

"Mother— **damn it.** You've seen the others. Let's just practice the damn thing. But, no touching." She says, as Mizo offers his hand. "Then, let's start." He says, as she hesitantly holds out her hand, then starts practicing the dance choreo. At first, they were both messing up in different places, but they got it down to a T. After they were observed and approved by July that our dance choreo was good, she announced, "Break time na..! Just come back here after 30 minutes..!" They instantly separated, as Rika goes to her water tumbler and drinks it.

"Hey, Mizo.. Can I borrow your alcohol? (isopropyl rubbing) Not that I.. um.. you get it..?" She asks, as Mizo acted all surprised then got his little rubbing alcohol and gave it to her. She quietly uses it, while looking down at her hands, then gives it to him with her head still down. "A—anyways.. What.. how's the progress in that 'poema español' we have to memorize..?" She asks, as she gains the courage to look at Mizo, and he answers, "I haven't started.. It's far off anyway, and there's the whole exam and research defense we gotta do, you know my situation.. Not ideal to add on that burden, **yet**.."

"Oh, I was just.. thinking about it. Profesora de español was talking about it earlier, on how every friday is our time to do it, but I falter on actually doing it and instead just play Techmino.. (tetris inspired game)" Rika says, as Mizo nodded and responded, "Yep. I've tried to, but I realize how pointless it is to do it, when I'd probably forget about it after that friday.. I just use it to write my novel." He said, as she chuckles. "I've checked your website, you don't even update **that** frequently. So I don't know where that time goes." She responds, as he smiled and looked at his phone, then he says, "I admit, I usually tire out during the night.. and long chapters and spinoffs don't just.. finish in one night."

She looks at me, then looks away as she asks, "Do you think I'd fit being a lesbian..?" Mizo is quite surprised by the tonal shift, but he chooses his words carefully; "Well.. are you?" She shrugs her shoulders and answers, "I **don't** know. I'm just.. asking you." Mizo responds with; "Well, you'd better ask an actual girl, and a lesbian at that than me, but—" She quickly looks at him and says, "But..! I only ask you this, I know what I'm doing, Mizo.." She tried to say something after that, but she shut herself up. "I.. uh.. well, ahem. I'll say.. yeah. But..! Don't take that personally.."

She shakes her head and responds; "It's fine, I asked the question. But.." She looks at him, and manages to form a small smile. "I'm grateful for your honesty." She looks away, then leaves.

## Hidden and Seen

### Author's Note:

So, looking for a crossover chapter? Here it is..! The canonical reason for the whole main series is it's like Mijo's novel he's writing based on his adventures, so he doesn't notice that Mizo and Rika beside him in this chapter are also kinda important (in my world), so he doesn't write about it. 

At least, that's my reason to not write about them during Mijo's journey, but from this point on, I'll probably reference them, but they're still unimportant, and most likely, not going to be involved with the dark world.

My only one rule for writing these series of chapters for Mizo and Rika is that they don't ever go into the dark world, and with that, shatter the whole point of a more slice-of-life grounded story.

"So.. like do you not get it?" She asks, as Mizo scratches his head and nodded. "No.. why would you be wasting your time learning español outside of class..?" He says, before putting his hands up, then continuing, "I'm not saying you should stop, I'd just think if you're not going to spain or latin america for another seven years.. You'd probably be better off starting with like.. a language you could practice in-person.. Maybe refine that tagalog speak we struggle with..?" He says, as she shakes her head. "W—what do you mean..?! A trilingual alpha chad woman like me would never struggle with Filipino..!" She says, as she has a faint smile.

They accidentally bumped into another guy, and he apologized before moving away, he seemed to be in a hurry though, he looked like he was from their batch, but Mizo couldn't get a good look before he left, only that he carried a black sling bag. "Rika, you know who that guy is?" Mizo asked, as Rika tried hard to recall him. "Mijo..? I think.. He's like just a rando from 10-Dalton I met I kept seeing when at Waltermart.. I learned his name through an old friend.." 

"Oh okay.. then.." Mizo said, as they continued our way, but then they met Rhida, a somewhat popular student among then due to her membership in the journalism club, that Mizo joined. "Umm.. Mizo, have you seen Mi-m— I mean, Mijo.. anywhere?" She asks, as Mizo nodded and points in the direction of Mijo's general direction. "Thanks.!" Rhida leaves hurriedly too.

"Ummm.." Mizo says, before seeing in the corner of his eye, a research partner of his, clearly doing an experiment without his knowledge. "Hey, Mizo, isn't that your research partner..?" Rika asks, as he does a double-take and sure enough, she's the one. "What..!! They didn't.. didn't.." Mizo tenses up, as he remembered the dreadful memories that are associated with that project. "Oh.. you..." She looks to her left and sees someone that made her make me turn away from my original group mate. "W—what..?" Mizo asks, as she starts pushing him to run and so he goes with her.

"Nothing..! Keep running!" She whispers to Mizo, as they run to a secluded area. "Huh?" He asked again, as she turned to him seriously with her hands on his shoulders. "Are you okay?" She asks, as Mizo nodded and responded, "Um.. yeah, I think so?" She slapped him playfully and asked him again, "You froze up, Mizo.. and.. I just.. don't want you to keep getting hurt... When I'm around, tell me the.. truth.. okay..?" She looks at him, before pulling away. Mizo didn't know what to say, she was right. "Good, now.. let's just.. enjoy this afternoon first." She grabs him and they go to other areas.

## Start the Fire

"I wonder if we'll be friends if we switched genders..?" She asks, as Mizo jumped from his phone and looked at her. "Um.. I don't know. Hey! I have an idea." Mizo went near her and showed her an AI chat bot. "Let's see what it thinks." Mizo put in their personalities and some general info. "Hey..! Why do you have me written as a tsundere?!" She narrowed her eyes as Mizo smiled and answered, "Because you are—" She slaps him and takes his phone and changes a few things that Mizo can't figure out. "Hey, what did you—" Mizo stopped himself as she sent the message.

They read the message, and Mizo feels a bit interested in what the AI had to say, but Rika answered first. "I.. um.. you know, I always wondered what it'll be like to.. have the.. you know.." Rika gestures to Mizo's crotch. "Well, it'd probably be better to have one..? Yeah, because you don't have to pee sitting down, yea?" Mizo says as she nods heavily. "Such a hassle.. having to clean too..? And periods.. fucking periods.. I HATE THEM!!" She has an understandable reaction as Mizo calms her down. 

"They require me to buy pads, tampons every two weeks, and apply them every or so week.. Damn it!! Why does the uterus want to produce a baby that will not exist?! Can't... like it just start to work if it detects.. male liquids inside..?" ranted Rika, as Mizo replied with, "Unfortunately, my dear **girl— friend..** You live in a society. We haven't developed human body modification yet." 

"Why did you say.. **girlfriend** like that!?" She exclaimed as she tugged on his shoulders. "What? You're a girl, and you're my friend.." Mizo responds, as she slaps me. "*MIZO!* YOU DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. I swear.." She interrupts, as Mizo smiles and looks away, knowing she's blushing intensely. "Fine fine.." Nuzi responded, as Rika made him turn back to her, her face clearly blushing intensely. "Just.. ugh. You see this face? This face is of a woman responding to your *incessant teases*." She says with a kinda annoyed tone, as Mizo smiled slyly. "Yeah, I can see that, dummy." He pulls away from her, as they both calm down from that close encounter.

"Let's move on.. before you kiss me and I retaliate with a neck snap." She said, with a hint of sarcasm. "Fine.. If it makes you feel better, at least you don't get boners..?" Mizo says, as she chuckled a bit, looking at me with a faint smile. "You think getting a hard on is worse than a period? Really feminist of you, Mizo~" She says, as he retorted with, "Fine..! What about circumcision?" She laughs more and pulls hun closer, "One time thing. Imagine, you grow your foreskin back every month, and you have to re-experience that whole thing again, without anaesthesia, over the course of twenty one days _slowly_." She made her point proven with a finger on his chest as Mizo raised his hands up in surrender. 

"Okay, fine. I've exhausted my talking points anyway, let's move on from the crotch part before one of us thinks differently of the other." Mizo says, as she looks at him in his eyes, unamused. "Oh please, Mizo.. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how more horny you are..?" Mizo relents again, his hands moving to her hair on her shoulders. "No need. But you sound like you wanna know for real?" Mizo responds, as Rika blushes and pushes him away. "Stop..! Okay, okay.. Why don't we actually talk about what we were talking about and not.. embarrass each other with intense romantic flirting tension for half an hour..?" She comments as he nodded and pulled back, starting to feel that heat again.

"Fuck... dude.." Rika says, as she trembles and shudders. "We might have taken this too far.." Mizo responded as she nodded, adding "Yeah.. I'm.. I'm going to just leave.. Every time I stay here.. I get a little.. bit.. more heated." She stands up and looks at him, before walking to her room. Mizo calmed himself down too, his brain is overwhelmed and he's starting to feel sleepy. Mizo is lost in the hazy thoughts of Rika as he put his phone down and laid down on the couch.

"Riza.. Riza..? Rika.." Mizo is confused on what he is thinking as his brain flashed with a hundred sexual encounters, all leading up to the whole *climax* of it all. "Maybe.. should.. sleep.." He mumbled as he drifted off unconsciously.

## Come on Over

### Author's Note:

That's.. a natural progression of intense emotion burnout. I don't know where I got it but yeah. Anyway, see the aftermath. Cause' I'm seeing what these things do. Oh, by the way. My chapters aren't in order, but I'll rearrange them once

*A call is ringing, the usual one.*

"Mizo..? You coming to my house tonight?"

"No.. I'm sorry, Rika.. I'm.. busy. See you tomorrow though."

"Oh. Then... see you."

*Call hangs up*

Mizo sighed as he put down his phone, and said to himself, "I.. am not really busy, Rika. I just.. can't see you." Mizo lays down on his bed, the bed feeling tempting to sleep into but, the war raging in his head was too much. "Consequences, caught up to me.. I'm tired, exhausted, and worst of all, unable to face you, Rika." Mizo rolls on his bed, as he tried to calm himself, but Mizo snapped and punched a pillow so hard that it deflated. "What.." He stepped back, feeling the rage start to dissipate, his hand hurting.

"**God damn it**." Mizo cursed, as he fell to bed again. He felt a sense of urgency to move to his room next door that had his school stuff but every walk feels painful, and sometimes he would lose control and smack my body to a nearby cabinet, lamp, door, wall and anywhere. But after a lot of struggling, Mizo finally managed to open my door, but he collapsed on the floor before he started crawling to his other room, quite a few walks away.

"Just.. a few.." Mizo managed to crawl to his other room, and open the door, only to collapse right after, this time, for good as he was completely knocked out.

*Switching perspectives..*

"If he's busy.. he makes time.. I mean, he did that comic in my house.. So, why is Mizo.. denying..?" asked Riza to herself, as she looks at the contact photo of Mizo, taken during the christmas break. He looked happy as he was sticking his tongue out on the camera. "Mocking piece of SHIT!!" Riza impulsively punched her phone, not breaking it, but it did shock her as she quickly pulled back so much she hit her head on a shelf on the wall behind herm "Ow!!" She turned to punch the shelf but quickly redirected it to herself, knocking her down to the bed, being spread out.

"I.. shit. Fuck! I need him.. wait. No, I don't!" said Riza, before she sat up and grabbed her phone. "Fuck it. He's not here.. I don't want to do shit, I'm just.." Rika opens her mobile browser and puts it on incognito. "Rule34 Yuri.. please distract me.." continued Rika, as she grabs a body pillow and blanket. "Everything feels so cold.." murmured Rika, as she waited for the page to load.

## Do the Twist

Inspired by two people that often fight (let's just say Ikari-fly is the codeword) + an idea popped into my head when writing while listening to music.

"The.. guitarist..? lead vocalist..? Ehe~ Obviously I'm the obvious pick." Rika says to Mizo as they are outside of an instrument shop inside a super mall. "Nah. I fit better. You can't even sound like him, much less metal screams well. You sound like me out of breath." Mizo says to her, as she slaps him playfully. "Hey! I'm not that bad.. But.. who's playing drums?" She asks, as they look at a drum set inside the store. "Ah shit." Mizo says, as she turns to him slyly. "And who's the drum set owner here...? Mizo! **THAT'S YOU!!!!"** 

"Ah. Fine. But I get backing vocals too." Mizo says as Rika shuffles around then bothers him. "What song are we doing? Have you got any lyrics we can jam to?" asked Rika to me as he shook his head. "Nope. Fuck it.. Let's cover Nevermind by Nirvana. Including Endless, Nameless." He answered, as she nodded. "I knew it. Personally, I would've done Bleach, but whatever, nevermind." added Riza, as Mizo made her look at him. He was smiling quite a bit, she was at first confused, but slowly smiled as she leaned closer. "Don't _fucking_ do this ever **again**, bastard..." She whispered, their faces very close before she pulled back.

"Anyways!! Let's move on. Um, you need any replacements? I don't think I need any.." said Rika as Mizo shook his head. "Nah. I have enough drum sticks to turn into drumsticks!" Rika looks at him confused, but moves on. "Riight.." She is silent for a bit before not moving on and asking, "Wait, why would you want drum sticks to be drumsticks? Like the edible.. um.. no, the chicken thing you can eat. Not the wooden sticks used for drumming."

"Oh, come on, Rika. It's called a metaphor, like how you play guitar like you are having an aneurysm." Mizo says, as Rika slaps him. "Shut up. Don't use it like that **everrr**..!" She responds before sighing, and turning to face away. "Anyway, let's go buy some food, maybe have a. have a.. oh no." Rika looked at him all worried. "OUR FUCKING RESEARCH!!!! SHIT SHIT I GOTTA GO SEE YOU TOMORROW MIZO!" Rika turned to go away as Mizo also looked at his phone and sighed, before walking back to do his group's research too.

## Box-Shaped Box

### Author's Note:

"I miss the comfort in being sad, and just not being in emotional turmoil all the time. I hate how every move I do, I curse myself, and when people say what I think they'd say I'd be proven right by my own self-loathing."

That's likely what someone would say relating to this chapter; who said it? Honestly, interpret it all you want, whether it be a Rika, Mizo, or even another DeltaRambles character! Might as well include the writer, since the writer is the one writing these characters, anyways.. enjoy, if you can.

"Hey.. so.. are you okay?" Mizo asks, as Rika is scrolling on her phone. "No. Why?" She asks, as she continues to type on her phone. "Well, I know that, but like.. I've.. I've just been seeing you spend more time on your phone. And, less on us.. you know." Mizo says, while he grabbed some coffee from a cafe shop they went to. "Us..? Is there anything to talk about?" She asks, as she puts her phone down.

"I'm tired Mizo. I'm tired. I'm.. losing my mind. Every day I wonder why I'm still here, still in this damn school. The school is a pain. All pain. I don't know how to get out. We don't know each other. We've been like this for months. I've accepted the fact you'll have a better social life than me. You'll be relatable, and.. funny, while I wallow in my own depression, and people look at me weirdly. I'm tired of explaining myself. I'm tired of speaking like this. I just want to get through this. That's it." Rika turned back to her phone and started typing again.

"Rika.. Please, I just.. want you to be happy too. I can't help but feel you're neglecting everything in your life. Your tasks, have you done them?" Mizo asks, he's pretty concerned, but he sees she has no intention of letting him speak any longer. "I don't care. What's the point? What's the fucking point?! Nothing. I waste time everyday doing something I enjoy, only to come back to reality, facing myself in the mirror. I waste time running to the park, playing videogames, listening to music, writing in my diary, only to figure out that all I've done is pointless. All pointless." Rika says, she is noticeably holding back tears, but she doesn't show it.

"Do you have to have a point?" Mizo asks, as she snaps at him. "WELL CLEARLY THERE'S GOTTA BE A POINT TO MY SUFFERING?! Maybe, they'll reward me with a break, a date, any semblance of connection. But, I don't get it. My grades flounder. Inconsistent. What do I need to do? I DON'T FUCKING KNOW. And people like... my parents always have their fucking advice that I'M FOREVER IN DEBT TO AFTER FUCKING TRYING AND FAILING!" Rika immediately turns away, not letting me see her face, just the hair at the back of her head, flowing to her back.

"They eye me like an idiot, when I'm weak.. I've been locked inside that box shaped box for years.. I've been drawn into their tar pit trap.. I wish I could go away and turn back..." She sings, as Mizo recognizes the lyrics to be a modification of a Nirvana song. He doesn't say anything as she continues, "Hey, wait! I got a new complaint, guess I'm forever in debt to your priceless advice.. Grade-fearing people forgive no one just yet, cut myself on razors and pens.. Broken mind of 'My Highness' I'm left black. Throw down your classical noose so I can get it done.." 

She strained her voice as she sang, "Hey, wait! I got a new complaint, guess I'm forever in debt to your priceless advice.." She stays silent before turning to the table and is now typing on her phone again, clearly saddened and tired now, but she still ignores what she just sang as Mizo tried to come up with a response.

"Did you.. make that one up on the spot or did you write about it? I.. I'm impressed. I thought I was the writer here.. haha.." Mizo smiles, as Rika chuckles a bit and says, "I wrote it. I'm not smart like you in that way, you'd probably be able to do that on the fly. Hey, at least you made me laugh. Good job." She holds a thumbs up before continuing to type on her phone.

"Um.. So, are.. what are we doing..?" Mizo asks, as she shrugs. "I don't know, Mizo. I find that my.. uh.. what do you call it, where you like get relief after doing something that expresses the emotions?" She asks me, as he smiled and put his hand on her shoulder. "*Catharsis, sis.*" Mizo answered, as she shakes him and says, "Ah, yeah! That. Well, I'm less.. sad, but.. I'm not going to aay I am out of it. Still.. stil.." She is barely holding her composure. "In the—"

"Thick of it, everybody knows—" Mizo continued as she slaps him. "Stop!! Don't complete that.. that's a stupid song.." She says, with a smile, a first time for her in a while.

Edit: Change to Mizo/Rika third person limited pov — jmb~ | May 24, 2025 | 23:49

----

"Room 115.. it may be unofficial.. but that's what I call my room." Rika says as she and Mizo looked at a taped piece of paper with the lettering; 'Room: 115'. "You have.. a name for your own room?" Mizo asks, as she nods. "Mhm. It's where my guitar is so.. gotta have a name for my demos than.. 'Rika's Recordings #69'  and let it be called; 'The 2024 Room 115 Recordings' and it's also a great band name, or album name.. speaking of which, I haven't heard from you about your drum fills.. and backing vocals stuff..?"

"**Busy**. You get it, Rika." Mizo says, as Rika sadly nodded. "I suspected.. and I suppose your research isn't done yet?" She asked, and I also sadly nodded. "Yep. Still workin' on it. After all, a big day is coming up." He responded as she sighs and sits down on her bed. "You know, I just realized how.. melancholic our life has been these past few days." Rika says, as she drinks some bottled water.

"I don't know. Maybe it's just the school atmosphere getting to us? You know, the whole... 'competitiveness' trap." I said, as Rika sadly nodded. "I hate it. I hate that fucking capitalism-inspired shit system they call 'The Philippine Education System'." She said, as Mizo held her hand. "I get ya. With how many works they assign in these 'hell' weeks, no wonder we are exhausted, and they expect us to be fine during it..? No wonder that grade 9 killed himself.." He says, as Rika jolts in surprise.

"Wait what?! I didn't know.. thatt..." Rika commented, as I looked away in embarrassment. "Oh. Well, now you know." Mizo says as Rika smiles. "It's nothing to be ashamed of. We're.. talking about taboo topics after all, it only makes sense.. I think." said Rika, as he looked back at her. "Yeah, okay.. we lost the plot, what are we talking about?" He asks as Rika sighs.

"The broken system. But, it's more than that. It's how everyone is either unconsciously or consciously following it without fighting it. From my perspective, people just.. do stuff, and then.. force people to do so, through the system. By, how many tasks.. many problems.. I just feel overwhelmed, and lost." Rika sighs as she lays down onto her bed. "It'll come to pass though, yes?" Mizo comments, as she sadly nods. "Well, yeah. I'm just.. not sure if by the end, I'll make it.. well, not that I'd die, but that.. my future will be irreparably broken.." explained Rika, as he tugs on her arm.

"What? What's that supposed to mean?" Rika asks Mizo, as she holds his hand that is on her arm. "Explain yourself. You seem the type that needs hugs and kisses from your parents." He says as she slaps his arm away, with a faint blush. "W—well.. not like that!! But, yeah.. that's.." Rika looks at his eyes. "That's why you're here..!" Mizo says as he smirked before she continued, "OKAY! BUT NOT THAT WAY! jeez.." Rika is now intensely blushing as she looks away. 

"You seem so adamant about it.. but I digress. Go on with your venting before you get distracted by your confusing feelings for me." Mizo replied as Rika's breath hitched and she tightened her hold on his hand. "S—stop teasing.. Ugh..!" Rika turns to him as she sits up. "Whew.. I **almost** lost what I was trying to say.." Rika loosens her hold on him as she composed herself.

"I—It's just.. I'm so.. guilty of always being either the group member who's doin' nothin' or being assigned a menial task..! Like.. 'oh you didn't contribute any meaningful stuff, that means you get a deduction..!' I.. hate myself, for not being honest with everyone, including you.. just.. to.. pass.. this damn fucking grade.."  said Rika as tears swelled up, Mizo also felt a bit of hurt by hearing her talk, he had similar problems too. "I don't.. get it.. I can't.. I can't just be happy with how I organize myself. With how I defend myself. Every time.. I try to speak out.. I feel so guilty.. then.. then.. I go back home and cry to myself." Rika starts crying as she buries her head on his chest.

"I— I get it.. Rika, I don't even speak about my own problems.. You're.. better at that regard.. At least.. well, you can speak out, and.. that's a start." Mizo says, keeping himself from breaking down in front of her. "I.. just.. feel it would be better if I followed them.. but.. I don't know.. would it make me more.. happier..? But, I look at you.." said Rika, as she looked at his eyes. "And I see exhaustion etched into those black eyes with heavy eye bags.. I.. I think I'm just forced to be like this.." Rika continued as she hugged him tightly.

"It's okay.. Mizo.. you can cry too.." She continued, as the surprise made tears fall from Mizo's eyes. Silence took over as they hugged tightly before she pulled back and gave him her handkerchief to dry his tears out. She then gave me a pillow to reflect upon her words, as she laid down on her bed too. 

The electric fan's noise buzzed through their ears, while the aircon's hums barely went through their hearing. But, eventually, after a while, Rika spoke up. "This doesn't solve anything.. I don't think anything we two can do will be impactful in the grand scheme of things.  Pain will continue, the workload abusive.. and the journey will be harsh with many tears of trauma.. I.. I'm lucky to have you, and hopefully.. hopefully in that distant future.. I can jam with you on the stages, and have fun on the dance floor." Rika smirked before they hugged again, and then pulled back.

"Hopefully.. and.. I promise, Rika. I'll fight. We'll fight. Not only for ourselves, but to break this **fucking** system to pieces." Mizo said to her as they shook hands and moved to talk about other stuff.

## Hey, Pain

## Author's Note:

Born out of contempt and anguish

— jmb~ | 12:07 | Feb 5, 2025

----

"Uh.. hey you feeling okay?" messaged Mizo to Rika, as he noticed she wasn't anywhere to be found at school. After a tense minute, Rika responded with, "NO." Mizo then quickly asked, "Why?"

"DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PAIN I HAVE? PAIN OF EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW?! I'M SO TIRED AND YET I'M STILL GOING TO SCHOOL?! NECK PAIN, CAN'T EAT, CAN'T SPEAK! WHY AM I STILL GOING?! WHAT ELSE SHOULD I SAY THAT I HAVE SAID BEFORE? I'M TIRED, I'M IN PAIN, I'M SO LUCKY THAT MY PERIOD ENDED A WEEK AGO, OTHER FUCKING WISE I WILL BE SENT TO A HOSPITAL FOR HOW MUCH SCREAMING I'D BE DOING. DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE I SEE THE CARE FOR ME?! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, I'M IN PAIN AND ALL CAN PEOPLE SAY IS 'YOU'D BE OVER IT.' LIKE I CAN!!!!!!!!!!!" ranted Rika, before going offline.

"Rika..? I just wanted to.. nevermind. I understand, but.. your group mates are asking me if you're still going to school. So they can start the presentation." responded Mizo, as tense minutes came by with no response. He looked at the private message tab of his phone with worry, not knowing what Rika was doing. But he then noticed that Rika was at school now, wearing a neutral expression that Mizo knew was hiding immense pain.

"Rika! Uh, your group mates.." said Mizo, as Rika ignored him and went inside the classroom to put her bags down. "Your group mates are waiting for you right there..!" said Mizo, as Rika turned to them and grabbed some printed documents, gave it to them then got some paper then left the classroom. 

Mizo followed her until Rika turned her whole body to face them, then faced him at face level, since she was looking down the entire time. "Why.. are you following me.." questioned Rika, with a clearly weak voice and forced tone. "I.. I'm just concerned. You know your history, and I'm just.. checking up, as best friends do!" explained Mizo, as it clearly hit a nerve at Rika, making her swallow painfully. "Yeah.. yeah.." Rika turned her whole body away from him.

"Like.. I.. said.. I can't speak.. well. It hurts to use my throat for anything.. So **please**.. just leave me alone..." said Rika, clearly forcing her voice to be loud as Mizo saw her clutch the left side of her neck. "I can't.. I want to help you, how about the clinic?" asked Mizo, as Rika tensed up and shifted her body to look at him.

"Do.. you think.. that'll.. help..? If my parents are this.. uncaring about my neck pain issues.. you'd think that going to the clinic will help..? I have to go home anyway, they have to explain something that my parents have seen.. Can I do anything..? No.. I do not believe I can.. I can even present.. Every word.. is painful.. agonizing.. I'm only pushing through because of you.." explained Rhida as she clutched her neck again and gulped painfully. "I.. just don't want you to suffer alone, Rika. Or suffer at all. And, your self-harm history.. I just can't.. Is there anything I **can** do?" asked Mizo, as Rika is silent.

"If there is anything... I.. just accept what's going to happen, I'll be barely speaking, they'll grade me low, and I'll be suffering. That's it. There is nothing I could do. I'm sorry. I just.. didn't know how severe this neck pain issue is.. Ever since Sunday of Last Week, intense neck pain has been with me, as my condition worsens.. I don't even know if the condition worsens.. or the days just get worse.. I can't think properly either.. No wonder, I barely have done anything.." said Rika, as she sighs. "Just.. let me die in peace." continued Rika, as she walked away, Mizo stood there frozen in shock before trying to catch up to her. "Hey..!" called out Mizo, as he got a message from her. It reads;

"Pain. Worth nothing. I can't speak. I can't scream. This. Short messages of someone broken. Forgotten, ignored. An observer and an alien. Unworthy. Replaceable. A leach. An idiot. To wake up and try. To die in return. For I have confessed my sins, for I have not been redeemed. Sent to my hell, I will not return. Sent to die. Sent to suffer. Suffer eternally. These are words of someone in distress, someone not here anymore. Go home. Take the loss. For I can't find the sense in your suffering, go home, and rest. Survival first."

"W—what..?" commented Mizo as he looked at the message before quickly deciding to go to the classroom. He sees Rika, speaking to presumably her mom on the phone based off the conversation;

Rika: "Hello..? Mom, I want to go home." 

Rika's mom: "What?! Why?"

Rika: "My.. neck hurts remember..? No matter what I do, I won't be able to present. I.. can't speak properly.. I.. just wanna rest."

Rika's mom: "But it's a group presentation?! How are you going to present alone?! Can you even move up to grade 11?!"

Rika: "I.. can't."

Rika's mom: "Can you at least speak to your teacher about it? Or your group mates? You can just stand there and be on the technical side."

Rika: "It can't.. be."

Rika's mom: "I'm calling your dad."

*Hang up*

"Rika..?" asked Mizo, as he can see Rika wipe her tears away. "I—It's nothing. Go away." said Rika as she looked into the distance, her hands shaking with anguish. Mizo just sighed and moved nearby, behind her as she stood quietly, still shaking.

After a while, she gestured for him to come closer, as she started to rant again. "I don't know how much longer I can stand being here.. How long I can just.. take this pain. I.. want it all to disappear, the pain.. oh god the pain.. All I can do is.. nothing. Stand there, in that presentation, speak nothing and do nothing. They don't need me, but.. I need them. The grades.. I.. don't.. know.. what to say.. Mizo.. Nothing has worked." Rika looks at her phone, and starts to cry.

"No one.. I can't.. do anything! My parents push me this day to suffer longer.. suffer more.. all for a grade I won't get. I give up. Mizo. I'll.. accept whatever happens. I'm.. so sorry for bringing you into this. I'm.. going." Rika goes away and leaves, Mizo stands there, helpless and sympathetic.

## Stressed and Stretched

## Author's Note:

"After the complexities of the day before, time for healing is now."

Post-Traumatic Stress.. ahem.

Yeah, this one explores Rika's complicated situation being a person with intense sickness, battling school systems and her own insecurities, with Mizo as her companion and best friend. 

If you're here shocked by the previous section, welcome to Mizo/Rika's saga! Where we'll explore romance, friendship and trauma in the same chapter! But yeah, post-trauma recovery.
Hope.. you.. get some deep muses and thoughts once done, I guess.

"Well.. at least you were there." said Mizo as he drank some iced coffee with pearls. "Shut up.." Rika strained to say as they chilled on the mall chairs. "Worst part is.. can't even buy that.. is that why you bought that? Flex on me from my.. tonsillitis?" continued Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Hey, hey.. You should've bought one. I mean.. I think you can drink stuff like that still yeah?" asked Mizo as Rika moved her head from left to right, unsure. "I'm just.. making sure. It's not.. like.. I.. can think straight anyway." 

"Riiight.. you still have uh.. neck problems? Ooh and headaches. From what you've told me." said Mizo, as Rika nodded her head, while holding the left side of her neck. "I.. I'm.. handling it. It's just.. been.. so.. tiring to always remember to not be... turning my head willy-nilly." responded Rika, as Mizo nodded and turned to face her. 

"Hey, it's fine. I'm here. Just rest for now." said Mizo, as he held her hand. "I—I know. It's just.. it's been days.. it hasn't healed. And when I think it's about to disappear.. it reappears.. hurts.. every time..!" said Rika, as Mizo hugged her. A slight blush formed on her cheeks unnoticeable to anyone that doesn't know her. "You'll get through it, eventually.. it'll be gone. But, while you're here, you might as well rest yes?" said Mizo, as Rika feels comfort but also memories of trauma coming back. 

"Get through this.. I wish.. Mmmnnn.. Just.. stay with me.. for a bit longer." said Rika, as they continued hugging as Rika tried to lose herself in the warmth of a friend. The air between them was silent as people passed by, people going on their lives. But to these two, it was a much needed warmth they were missing for a while. Eventually, Rika pulled back as Mizo soon followed.

"Parents not home this.. week. Government stuff, don't remember." said Rika, as Mizo nodded. " 'Kay. I'll just.. I'll message my parents, hol' on." said Mizo, as he picked up his phone;

Mizo: hey ill be with my friend in her house for a while for like 2 days? Ill come back Saturday

Mizo's mom: oh? then are you getting your uniforms? oh, your dad's close, you should probably go back just to grab stuff for the next 2 days, love you~

Mizo: thanks, yea im getting them too

"I got their.. hm. permission? I just gotta go home. Then I'll get my stuff. Same house as before no?" asked Mizo, as Rika slowly nodded. "Yeah, same house.. D—don't worry, I'll wait near our gate. J—just call me when you're nearby.." answered Rika, as Mizo smiled and got his things. "Well, see you then. Love!" said Mizo, before booking it. "H—hey..! mmnn.. even now.. teasing dummy.. though.." said Rika, as she got her things too and sighed. "I.. wonder what.. he's going to do next?" continued Rika before a headache started worsening. "Agh.. mmm.. Y—yeah.. I'm going home.. just.. bear with me for a few moments, okay body..?" said Rika before going down the floor of the mall.

## Am I Dumb?

## Author's Note:

Hey so this one is a mix of past and present, experimental. But I just wanted to mix the dynamic and have a prelude to the Valentine's Special. I want to explore more than just; "tomboy-ish tsundere meets a push-and-pull teaser-typa' guy" but this is where it headed to, so I continued it. Anyways, hope you enjoyed it, even if it is a lot of romantic tension between two supposedly best friends!

Rika is walking silently across the pavement before entering the high school of her life, and with it, will start off her many misadventures, for now though, she's just a fresh high school student (Philippines Version) after her online class of 21-22 in Grade 7.

"I wonder.. if I'll meet anyone in this.. school..?" Rika thinks to herself as she walks to her classroom line at the flag raising ceremony. She sees a lot of people, future friends, then a certain Mizo, scrolling through his phone. "He seems like a weird kid. But, honestly.. I'm one too.." Rika comments to herself, as she notices him looking up then meeting her gaze before both look away.

Later that school day, Rika is looking for a place to hang out alone at when she finds Mijo taking her (intended) spot. "Hey..! Ahem.. ahem. That's.. uh.. my spot..!" said Rika, as Mizo looked at her and smirked. "Nah. You don't own any spot bruv." said Mizo as Rika took a step closer. "Well, it's just.. rude you know." said Rika, putting her hands on her hips. "Rude? I don't know you. How can that be?" questioned Mizo as Rika crossed her arms. "W—what? Well, it's just, that's my spot. I claimed it just this morning." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Well, I am here first, so it's mine now."

"Hays.. Fine. I'll just.. go there then, hmmph! Stupid." said Rika before going to a different spot nearby and started eating her snack. 

_Fast forward.._

"When we first met.." said Mizo as he looked on the balcony where that memory happened. "You were rude. Still rude to this day." said Rika as Mizo chuckled. "I admit, I just didn't want to talk to you during that time. Welp, how things change huh?" said Mizo as he quickly kissed Rika on the lips before pulling back. Rika was blushing as she stammered, "Sh—shut up.. We might be.. best friends now, but you kept your attitude about me."

"Oh? I'd say I changed." said Mizo as Rika does an exasperated sigh. "I.. fine. It's.. more.. um.. your personality didn't change, and we just.. know each other a lot more." responded Rika, as Mijo kissed her on the lips again, but pulled back before Rika could appreciate it. "H—hey! If you're going to kiss me.. at least make it last.." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Oh? Didn't I hear you last week, avoiding my kisses? I accepted it, but now you want more?" said Mizo, as Rika's blush became more intense. "D—different.. situation..!! Okay? T—that's why I said that day only." responded Rika, as Mizo booped her at her forehead.

"Mnn.. stop.." said Rika as Mizo held her very close. "I—I.. I'm serious.. we're at school.." said Rika, as Mizo pulled back and shrugged. "Fine.. I guess. Though, when I look into your eyes... I see desire.. haha.." said Mizo, as Rika held Mizo's shoulders to calm her already intense blush down. Mizo stops as Rika stared him down,  like she's about to either kill or make out with him. "Stop.. please.. I.. beg. I'm about to melt here.." Rika says in a soft, needy voice. This surprised Mizo, and his instinct is to respond, "Fine.. fine.. I'll keep my teasing down, **for now**."

Rika pulls back, and pulls a smirk. "Well well.. You know, I was waiting to use that on you." said Rika, looking directly at Mizo. "You got me." responded Mizo, putting his hands up on the air. "But.. I am serious. No more of school kisses okay?" said Rika, as Mizo nodded. "School specifically? So when we go to the supermall later I can?" questioned Mizo, as Rika blushed slightly again. "I'll decide on that.. But..! S—still no surprises! I hate.. surprises.." said Rika, as Mizo grabbed her hand, the warm feeling washing over them both.

"Mm.. What..? Are you eager? We still have to go to Kari you know.." asked Rika as Mizo nodded. "My dearest love, we have to—" said Mizo, before Rika slapped him playfully. "No! We're not having that. Dummie. Just.. Make sure I wasn't an idiot for being friends with you... Come on, let's go." responded Rika as Mizo nodded with a smirk and started to walk.

## Deep Seeking

## Author's Note:

Ooh what's that? A Valentine's Special? By a person without an actual love to celebrate it? I'm just joking. But, yeah.. I had some.. 'free time' today (Procrastination 100) and well, we gotta have one, right?

Um, as for relationship implications, honestly, just assume most chapters are self-contained in their stories lol.

sidenote: I've realized I should connect these, so.. um, if they connect. They connect, but if they don't, they don't.

"Rika.. will you marry me?" Mizo asks, one leg kneeling with a ring box. "I.. I.." Rika stutters before the director, Kari shouts, "Cut!" Instantly both of them went away from the set, as Kari commented, "Great job you two.. Thanks for giving up your dignity as well, I promise.. our dignity will not die in vain, your director editor is the best.. well, somewhat good." Before turning to the camera that was stopped by herself to look over the footage again, as they are right behind her drinking some water.

"I'm.. **NEVER** doing that again.." Rika exclaimed as she drank some more water. "Unless we need a second take of course." said Mizo, as Rika slapped me on my arm. "I said. **NEVER.** I'm not that.. type! Oho, if I had a lover, I'd be making them beg for my love!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled and tugged on her arm, making her look. "No wonder you don't have anyone for tomorrow's 'Día de San Valentín'!" added Mizo, as Rika retaliated, "Like you have anything to say, incel boy. I'm sure whatever rizz you had, it had dissipated a long long time ago.." 

"Oh? Then why are you still here?" asked Mizo, as Rika faintly blushed before regaining her composure. "What?! Can't a woman just drink water while speaking to an idiot? Besides, what about you?" responded Rika as Mizo smirked. "Would I be wrong if I said because of you, dear **friend?**" asked Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Oh? Then **'dear friend'** what if.. I left, hmm? Follow me, because you're a loser?" retorted Rika, as Mizo smiled and said, "Oh? Bold of you to assume that, as if I'd follow you.." while moving closer to Rika.

"Guys guys, are you going to kiss or something? Cause' I'm heading home to continue my editing, and I can't stand the romantic tension here..!" said Kari, as she finished cleaning up the set. "Romantic tension..? Hey! It's just friendly banter.. shut up!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled as he placed his hand on her shoulder. "Yeah, yeah. No need to be so.. so touchy about it, right Rika?" said Mizo, as his face was close to Rika, her blush becoming more obvious.

"Gah! I'll leave now, before I witness the coupling of two obvious lovers." said Kari before leaving the set. "Mizo.. I uh.. think that was.. um.." said Rika, as Mizo held her hand. "Hey, you can share it, I'm not going anything you're not comfortable with." said Mizo, as he pulled away a bit. Rika sighed and leaned in to kiss Mizo, as Mizo kissed her back, surprising her but letting Mizo explore her mouth a bit before pulling back. "Just.. relieving some tension, that's all. Anyways, let's go! Let's catch up with that girl before she assumes we're having sex." said Rika, before dragging Mizo with her to Kari.

"You guys took your time.. well, I'd just assume it was a heart to heart and move on. Come on, let's go to the mall!" said Kari, as she walked them to their local supermall. They went inside and Kari gravitated to the shop offering pearl drinks, while Rika and Mizo followed her.

"Large iced coffee with pearl, 100% sugar, and more ice!" said Kari, as Rika and Mizo looked at each other with amusement. Then Rika ordered  next, "Uh.. I'll have.. um.. the iced chocolate drink one, uh.. normal sugar, normal ice.." Rika then turned to Mizo, as he stepped up. "I'll have the normal regular milk tea, in ice i guess.. normal ice and sugar too." They waited nearby as Kari was speaking to Rika.

"Please please come with me to that trinket store, I promise It'll be fun..!" said Kari to Rika, as Mizo was using his phone. "Uhuh, and then you'll convince me to buy a small keychain, then push me to gift it to Mizo?" asked Riza, as Kari smiled and waggled her eyebrows. "I.. fuck you.. let's just go already." said Rika before they finally got the order with Mizo.

"I'd assume you two are on a shopping spree? I'll be at the chairs outside— or at that shop where they sell flags, just call me whn you're done, you two, maybe I'll have a surprise for Rika here~" said Mizo as Rika slightly blush. "Uhuh.. yeah we'll be doing that, see ya then." responded Rika before Mizo smiled and left, as Kari dragged Rika off to the store.

## The Future of the Beyond

## Author's Note:

"Look to the past, look to the future.."

A reflective chapter on the future, and how it affects Mizo/Rika.

— jmb~ | March 3, 2025 | 1:19

"I'd be.. a bit dumb if I said I wasn't worried." said Mizo, as he and Rika chilled on the 4th floor of a school building, the wind blowing. "Yeah, I know.. it's.. genuinely.. haunting to look at my future." responded Rika, as Mizo looked at her and gestured to her to elaborate. "I'm not doing so hot at math.. I have so many missings.. I can't.. can't.. do anything.. correct. One moment, another time, or this moment, things happen not in my favor. I.. had a reflection during friday last week, you didn't come to school, so I was alone for the entirety of the event." said Rika, as she sighs and gets her phone.

"In short.. I was.. alone. I felt.. just.. alone. The event went around me, and I got some cool songs to add to my playlist.. But, I was just there.. wallowing in my own misery. We have talked about it, but.. for that four hours.. I felt.. all of it coming back, the trauma, the fight... All of the pain from school.. I felt.. defeated. Those.. moments. I hate it. I just.. feel so powerless, y'know..? The.. things I'd hear.. things people say... I'd just wish to grab my razor and cut myself, if I hadn't had enough.. scars. All around, the atmosphere seems to be at least hopeful, but I feel no hope for the future now. I only see the future pain I'll feel." said Rika, as she paused for a minute, pondering before looking at the cloudy sky of the late afternoon.

"They'd ask me, what's your plan for tommorrow? For the next month? The next year? I.. don't know. Yet, I am always forced to pick. Somehow, I never got a proper way to speak to older people to back off. I'd feel.. like I'd be invalidated 'cause I'm a woman, or I'm in an emotional state, or just very sensitive.. I hate it. I don't.. need to know the future. I just want to focus on right now, right here, what **CAN** I do? I can't... enjoy stuff, when other people are around, if you or Kari aren't nearby and are with other people.. that includes certain family.. I often feel like I need to hide a lot of things. I feel... that their help is not what I need. What I need is for them to back off." continued Rika, as she held Mizo's hand, shaking a bit.

"I'm afraid. I'm afraid of losing you two. It's.. only a month until.. sections change again. I'm alone again. I can't.. live with this." said Rika, as tears formed on her eyes. "People.. say I have this certain sassy tsundere attitude, and.. while.. true, it's not like it's just a descriptor of who I am, but rather an insult. I'd feel defeated whenever people ask me about you and blame my problems because of you, and are distracting from schoolwork.. I hate them. But, the words go through. I don't want them to go through..." continued Rika, as she started crying.

"I know how.. exactly how you feel. For me, it's been like that, guess I have.. parents, not what'd I call perfect.. Just, not as blatantly disresepctful. Look to my future, they want me to choose something, follow my sister outside the city, or stay here. I don't like being told what I should do, and where I should go¸ yet it's almost pointless when the old people you talk to don't understand you. I think some try, but it really boils down to not assuming everything." said Mizo, as she brushed Rika's hair, as Rika moved closer to his chest.

"Worst part is.. what else do you want me to do? It's a constant battle for me, to live. I have two sides, one out for the pleasure, seeking happiness and comfort.. While the other one is my darker side, the one who thinks about what has happened and is going to happen, the one that rationalizes my suicidal thoughts.. Just one single jump.. and you don't have to endure it.. I hate thinking like this, but sometimes all I can do is walk away. Leave the conversation. *They think my guilt isn't high enough, oh boy if it were to go higher, I would've grabbed the nearest knife and cut my throat.*" said Rika, in-between sobs and constant push-and-pull from her to Mizo.

"I.. never suffered from physical.. pain, to hurting myself.. But, I've experienced blacking out nights, up and away, writing constantly. I don't know if half was me coping or half was rushing, but all I knew is that if I kept on typing, I'd feel better. Writing is my escape from this hellish school, we have different problems but we both suffer. Gaming is like an escape sometimes, but it can feel so guilty to come out of that and feel tired and your supposed parents going out on you because you're tired, even though yes, you do get tired from gaming. I don't like.. the constant productivity attitude. I struggle constantly with dealing with stuff I know I can do, but motivation often down for many external reasons." said Mizo, as he held Rika more tightly.

"Mizo.. it's.. more than that for me. I like playing music, I like making cool art, but.. when I finish a track or take a break, if I'm caught literally doing anything that seems like I'm just resting, I'm chastised. I hate them. I hate them. Can I just say I hate them? Because I **DO.** These things matter more than 'oh we just let you' no shit that's why I remember when you make me conflicted. Misusin' your 'authority'. Gah..! Days feel so short. Videos fly over. I want something to hold me at a time and a place. I want a moment to last. But as long as an internal battle rages on in my brain and heart.. I'll die knowing I messed up somewhere." said Rika, as she reciprocated and hugged him tightly too.

"There's.. no way both of us can comfort each other, except our presence.. I have my problems, you have yours. At least you have someone to speak it to, for most of the time." said Mizo, as Rika went closer to his face, slight blushing unknown to Rika. "Yes! That's why I.. can't, I just can't let you go... You have helped me so much.. I'd feel a piece had been torn off my body if you disappeared from my world..." interrupted Rika, as Mizo sighs and kisses her on the forehead.

"We'll be fine. Okay? The future is nearby, the past haunts.. But as long as we stay in this moment, we'll be safe.. even for just a moment." whispered Mizo, as she kissed her on the lips this time. He quickly pulled back, when Rika started to speak up again, "You're right.. But I want it to last forever... I can still hear the sounds of.. doors opening, and surprise sermons.. I.. wanna forget all about that.. but.. fine, just for this moment..." The two go silent as the two shifted between hugging, holding each other and just being present with each other.

"I'll.. say I want to say, fuck the system, but.. again.. I'm a loner. An outcast in a liberal science city. You and Kari, I like you two, I just.. don't believe it's enough. Getting something done.. is empty. Grades feel empty. Future looks empty. The past isn't all sunshines and rainbows, but... I'd wish for times where I didn't struggle with **living**." said Rika, as Mizo added, "I get it. I really do. It's not as simple as sprading a message, you have to live and breathe it. What I mean is, masking for us two isn't great, it makes the situation worse. You'll be hated. But, die knowing you weren't faking and you were livin in the moment." before he kissed Rika for a long while, before they broke off.

"Always find a way to.. amuse me. Let me.. rest my brain for a minute.." said Rika, with a smile and slight blush. "Same. I do not want this to be as gloomy as outside right now." commented Mizo, the atmosphere looking muted and gray.

"Heyy~" said Mizo, as he put his shoulders around Rika, causing her to blush. "Ah?! Mizo.. it's you.." said Rika, as Mizo kissed her on her forehead. "Mizo..!" said Rika more firmly as Mizo turned Rika to face him, with a smug face. "Rika? How's it been? Feeling better?" asked Mizo, as Rika remembered her trauma and flinches. "Ah.. no." said Rika, feeling immense guilt and emptiness. "Oh? Do you... want to talk about it?" asked Mizo, as Rika's breath hitched and after a minute or two, shook her head. "No..." said Rika before going silent. "Oh okay, then we can do.. this?" asked Mizo as he turned her to face him, but all he saw in her face was emptiness.

"Are you okay?" asked Mizo, his face going closer. Rika didn't respond, simply looking away. Mizo went closer to her to kiss her on the lips, but it felt empty as Rika let him without any resistance. Mizo pulled back, concerned. "A—are you..?" asked Mizo, as he playfully slapped her cheeks but she didn't respond. Rika is silent, it's clear she's going to say something, but she stops herself.

"Do you want.. me to leave?" asked Mizo, as Rika's breath hitched again and her whole body tensed up. "No.. wait.. it's.. not like that. Please don't go..." said Rika weakly, trying to hug Mizo tightly, but her whole body was exhausted. "Then.. talk to me.." whispered Mizo, as Rika didn't respond again, but Mizo looked at her face, she was clearly opening her mouth to say something again, but closing.

Suddenly, she pushed him away. "Then.. go." she said, shakingly. "Go.. away..!" said Rika more loudly, her voice hoarse and shaky. "I will." said Mizo, before sighing and leaving quietly. "Wait.. why.. no.. stop.." muttered Rika to herself, as she watched Mizo leave her alone in the cold afternoon of a cloudy day.

"Why.. no.. why.." muttered Rika as she held on to the balcony railings, looking at the ground intensely. "I should've stopped myself.. I.. can't push _him_ too.. I **need..**" said Rika, before she accidentally got off-balance and fell to the ground. "him.." continued Rika, before she tried to get up, the intense pain affected her but she forced herself to stand up. "Agh.. Mizo.. Kari.." muttered Rika, as she struggled to stand up, holding most of her weight onto the railings. 

**_"The razor feels pretty good right now..."_**

"The razor.. I have it." said Rika, as she leaned on the balcony walls and got her razor out from her bag. "Should.. I.." said Rika, hovering the razor over her already scarred left arm.

**_Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it._**

"What.. no.. not again.. I can't hide this one.. but.." said Rika, as she got even more worried, and now she is hyper-ventilating. "I pushed him away.. will this..?" asked Rika to herself, her razor getting closer and closer.

**_Cut. Slash._**

"Feels.. good. Just.. pain.. blood.." said Rika as her razor clattered to the ground, with a small blood stain as she got her handkerchief to stem the blood, as the pain intensifies. She manically smiles as she continues holding her now bleeding arm, feeling more energetic than she actually is. The rush is fleeting, as it slowly starts to slow down, and the wound starts healing with her handkerchief wrapped around her arm.

"No..! Not.. yet.. please.." said Rika, as she starts to lose consciousness, the intense trauma as well as the wound coming back. "I need this..." said Rika, as she pressed on her wound, getting her a small gasp of air. "Yes.. yes.. keep me.. here.. just a bit longer." muttered Rika, as she felt clear, clearly in pain, physically. She knew where it was, how to push it, how to make it go, and most importantly, she felt free to do this, to herself at least.

**_Blank._**

"Rika..?" asked Mizo, as Rika woke up on her bed, with Mizo by her side, and her wounded arm bandaged. "Mizo..!!" shouted Rika, as she lays on the bed frame behind her. "W—where am I?! Wh—where's my razor?!" questioned Rika as she held on to the sheets of her bed.

"I cleaned it. It's in your bag." said Mizo, before he held her hand tightly. "Mizo.. I.. I see. I'm sorry for causing this.. the whole thing. I—" said Rika, before Mizo hugged her tight. It stopped her train of thought completely, as she embraced it completely.

"You don't have to. I.. am.. here." said Mizo, as Rika calmed herself down, until she blushed suddenly. "Hey hey.. can you pull back for a sec..?" asked Rika, more casual but a.. particular dream resurfaced, the one she was having earlier. "Huh? Yeah, what is it?" asked Mizo, as Rika is blushing heavily.

"You know about.. my fantasies yes? So.. Ummm.. I had like a.. dream about you.. raping me." said Rika, with intense embarrassment holding a pillow, as she gasped a bit due to her wounded arm being pressed on by the pillow.

"W—what? When we just talked about.." said Mizo, as Rika threw a pillow at him. "I know!! I'm sorry.. okay?! It's just.. I've been spiraling a lot.. and.. needed a distraction.. and.. I've been thinking about you and Kari a lot.. so.." said Rika, as Mizo smirked. "Well, well.. as.. it turns out, I'm not going to be the first to be weirdly horny about my friend." said Mizo, as Rika squirmed at this comment.

"Gah! Okay, the reason I told you this was.. that was the recent dream I had, and.. and.. your.. body just reminded me of it okay? Nothing sexual. Please. Nothing. sexual. Dummie, I will never allow you to touch me sexually, okay?!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "I won't. But, nevermind. Just a fantasy, right! No more... Trust me, I'm not..." said Mizo, before Rika interrupted, "Stop! I don't believe that! Of course! I'm.. not that sex-crazed!! You are." said Rika, as she went closer to his face.

"Haha.. okay, but seriously.. are you fine? Are you good? No more cutting on my watch okay?" asked Mizo, as she chuckled. "I.. have no promise. But.. I.. okay. I'm.. I was weak." said Rika, as Mizo went closer too, getting Rika to blush. "H—hold on... you're.. too close.." said Rika, before Mizo asked, "Hm? Why?" as he pulled back. "D—dummie.. I can't speak about my trauma when all I can do is... shu.. sh.. nevermind.. You'll tease me about it.. Just keep it there, okay?" explained Rika as Mizo smirked and nodded.

"Okay.. so.. I just.. couldn't take myself being worse than what I've been since.. forever at this point. I lie about being physically sick so I can go home and heal my mental health, and I squander my free time. I hated myself so much for letting people order me around, until I broke when you showed up, I couldn't.. couldn't speak, and well.. escalation until I couldn't take the noise and.. cut.. Felt good, I admit.. But, well.. consequences tend to scar me." continued Rika as she held and looked at her left arm.

"I see.. I.. was weak too, y'know. Honestly? That rejection hurt me, so I left.. But as I walked, I stopped and started circling, I knew I couldn't leave you alone, not that I don't trust you, but.. you were.. broken, I couldn't.. leave friends alone. So after a while, I made up my mind. I went to see you again, preparing to apologize for returning. But, I stopped myself, after seeing you bleed while unconscious. The rush of protecting you.. I don't.. I've never seen it so full effect on me until those hours." said Mizo, as Rika felt a flutter in her chest before shaking her head, and smirking. 

"Awww.. you care for your tomboy tsundere girlfriend that much..?" mocked Rika before Mizo kissed her in the lips. "Mmmnn.. nngh.." mumbled Rika, as Mizo pulled back, shaking his head. "So you admit you're a dere, a tsu— tsundere?" asked Mizo, as Rika blushed. "Ah.. shut up... anything I say will be turned against me.. baka.." said Rika in a slight sarcastic tone. "You started it." said Mizo, with a smug face as she blushed more intensely. "N—no.. you did..! B—besides.. wh—what's.. the point of.. this is your time..!" said Rika, as she looked away, pouting while side-eyeing him.

"Okay, okay.. Fine. I'm stopping, besides you're about to burst of love right there.." said Mizo, as Rika groaned. "Eh..?! I.. damn it.. Ugh.. okay, fine.. I'm going to reply." said Rika as she turned to face Mizo. "I.. don't want to promise that I won't.. because.. I wouldn't know what I'd experience.. What kinda problems get thrown at me... All I can say is.. I got my cut.. and I regret doing it.. i—is that what you want?" asked Rika, as Mizo sighed and nodded. "I know you're troubled, like me. It's fine, that you can't promise me not falling, because you're still healing. Just.. find other ways, okay..?" asked Mizo, as Rika nods.

"Like your writing..? In my art..? It takes a person to be persistent and.. well, disciplined.. as well as creative. I haven't.. been anything I'd wanted to be for a while now.. I'll.. see." said Rika, as Mizo nodded, satisfied as he started to smirk again. "What.. what's with the smile?" asked Rika as Mizo kissed her and pushed her to the bed. "Mmmnn...!!" said Rika as they kissed passionately, while Mizo guided Rika to lay down on her pillows, he pulled back because he wanted to check on her face, and arm too. "What..? What.. oh.." said Rika, as she was clearly blushing and felt one of his hands gently hold her left bandaged arm.

"I was just checking.. Didn't want you to hurt now.." said Mizo, as he then gently rested beside her. "I.. thanks." whispered Rika, as she unconsciously cozied up near him more. "I wonder.. if.. you know, we.. go.. deeper. Like.." said Rika, as she looked at him very closely. "Gets. Well, both virgins, I guess, but not like we can't.. we just have to be careful, besides, we're still working on those... fantasies, eh?" responded Mizo, as Rika blushed. "F—fantasies.. shut up.. ugh.. But.. yeah.. You know, I didn't mention it, but almost all my.. self-hatred seeped into that dream, like.. you know that taboo topic about the rape victim enjoying the rape..?" said Rika, reflective.

"Oh? I've.. seen stuff like that before. I know people have that fantasy.. like you~! Or that sexual functions override conscious thought.. It's.. complicated. What.. what.. do you think? What do **you** reflect on your dream?" questioned Mizo, as Rika blushed harder and looked away. "Hmm.. I would hate it. Yeah. But, I don't know why.. I was so weak.. I couldn't... push you away. or.. how I was completely under your handle.. I guess I fear you acting on perverse desires.. since I know you.. you're quite **strong**.." answered Rika, as Mizo smirked, and nodded understandingly.

"I can see the look.. you're so smug about me calling you.. ugh. But.. yeah. That compounds me with my self-hatred.. I have a genuine desire to be a free woman, but.. I have these.. you know, submissive tendencies sometimes? I hate.. that, well.. when it.. hurts me. Gets? Like.. that dream, I was.. I guess, enjoying some of it, but I was also in pain.. But at the end, I got.. uh.. you know when a girl is stimulated by like three.. 'devices' in a scene? That was.. the end as I.. I guess completely submitted to you..? During when I just woke up.. in the dream, a fake waking up." explained Rika, as Mizo thought about it.

"That is pretty detailed for a dream.. But, I get it, like an unforgettable.. wet dream huh? Hmm.. everyone has something they don't like to have, but have, take me! I'm quite.. social, but always felt that these convos are empty, and I let it happen, because I also speak like that. It's.. something you'd have to manage I guess. And yeah.. this conflict, especially in sex.. is.. hard to reconcile, some people are simply.. enhanced, or have duality. Like us! I have 'enhanced' desires and you have 'opposite' desires." said Mizo, as Rika nodded in understanding.

"Ah.. okay.. Fine. I'm just going to accept that.. I'm.. getting tired.. it's night right? I'm going to be— sleep..." said Rika, as Mizo whispered into her ears. "Mhmmm.. goodnight kiss?" asked Mizo, as Rika turned to face her and Mizo kissed her immediately. They were locked in that kiss as Rika's hands involuntarily moved to his back to pull him closer, as he did as well. Eventually Mizo pulled back, as Rika was panting. "Want me..?" asked Mizo, as Rika blushed. "Sleep wherever.." said Rika, as Mizo cuddled her. "Ah..? ah.. okay.. just.. don't get morning wood and poke me.. okay..?" asked Rika, as Mizo responded, "No.. guarantees, but.. I'll try, don't worry.. I'll pull back if you feel.. weird." Rika sighs and nods before closing her eyes, her left hand noticeably more separated as her right arm is closer.

"Rika..? Hey, at least you're not cutting yourself this time, huh?" said Mizo, as he saw Rika look out on a familiar balcony. "No. Not yet. Anyway.. Hello, Mizo." said Rika, in a calm yet almost reflective tone. "Hm? Heyy~! Rika..!" said Mizo as he booped her cheeks. She slightly blushed before giggling and stopping him. "I know I look.. sad. But, it's just how these.. moments work. Come, Mizo. Let's just.. talk. We had enough.. teasing earlier hmm? Like how you kissed me for a while in the hallways." said Rika, as Mizo smirked but turned serious as he nodded. "Aight, talk." said Mizo, leaning near her nearby.

"I've been thinking a lot about.. life ever since.. the incident. I.. just wished that sometimes I didn't have to have conflict with myself. I.. hate myself, right? But.. it's either I'm trying to be myself, which internalizes guilt and shame or wear a fake mask that I keep up until I collapse. It's not that the mask is inherently bad, it's.. how I use it, to hide myself.. Is what's bad. Again... this all ties back to.. what caused this? Who did and if so, why? I have answers, but.. I want you to comment." mused Rika, as Mijo thought of her situation.

"I don't really know, Rika. But.. if you want me to speculate, school right? But.. Well, there's no good way of putting this, but you're like an insecure anxious person clinging because you didn't have anyone to do so before, so when you find someone, you can't stand disappointing them?" replied Mijo, as Rika felt intense hurt for some reason, even though she knew it herself. Tears start forming. "To the letter." said Rika, as she chuckled like almost hurt but hiding it. "I.. have a.. bad relationship with my parents, Mizo." said Rika, as she suddenly closes her eyes, hyperventilates and mutters, "I'm sorry.." multiple times. Mizo quickly goes to comfort her as she experiences her worst trauma before she suddenly opens her eyes and instinctively moves her hands to her chest, near her heart.

"I'm.." trailed off Rika as she moved to hold herself from the railings. "What.. I.. I.." continued Rika before Mijo spoke up, "It's fine. Rika, just.. calm yourself down first. I'll be here all afternoon." said Mizo, as Rika nods and after a while, regains herself back. "I'm sorry—" apologized Rhida before she got cut off by Mijo, "Please. Don't apologize. This is not your fault. If you suffer and unintentionally make other people suffer because of this, don't be guilty. That.. tends to make it worse." Rika sighs and nods as she looks to the surroundings again.

"I know.. I know that. I'm trying to realize that. I.. feel trapped with them. Almost like.. with you, actually. I hate them but I need them. My parents, I mean. To tell the truth, it's not as bad as you think, yes they're quite neglectful sometimes.. But some agency would've called by now if basic love and help wasn't given. It's just.. I guess, I feel that somehow... they don't have the ability to help me. Like, if I was honest, they'd get mad and ask why and be condescending and all that shizz. Honest in.. what I think about them, school or any topic that's sensitive to them. I TRY to be.. polite, but.. if I don't assert myself, I'll just fail because they're the authority figures and I'm their girl that needs to be taught how it ought to be for her age and role!" reflected Rika, as she looked down, looking defeated.

"I see.. It's... weird to me. I.. certainly don't have perfect parents, but.. I feel they've been caring. You know, you often reflect what your closest have done, so if you're neglected, you'll be neglectful. With me? If there's one thing I'll say, it's that emotions for me are.. other people's problems, or what I mean, is that I learnt that I have someone to lean on, and so to be honest about something is to hurt but also heal.. I reflected on my protective streak during the incident.. It's something to do with how my parents don't necessarily criticize me but rather teach me why it's wrong and what to do, and after it starts working, I start to trust them a lot. I mean.. ahem. Wait, I need to ask you.. Do you think you have any mental.. disorders?" replied Mizo, as Rika looked at him with a sad face and nodded sadly.

"Let's see.. I definitely have some form of C-PTSD. Complex trauma based on parental neglect and school system issues? Sounds perfectly descriptive of me. Though, I'd know why. I have ADHD-I and Autism. That means my problems are considered being lazy and antisocial." admitted Rika, as Mizo was a bit surprised but nodded. "I.. kinda expected you to have some sort of trauma response since.. well, you cut yourself. And we're friends, so either you have ADHD, Autism or both. Apparently both. So.. no wonder. You already have a lot of issues and it's compounded by neglect.. I'm lucky my parents are more honest, my dad's autistic, and he's like the HR guy too, funny that. My mom's adhd, inattentive. She excelled in accountancy.. so now they're both at the government. What about you?" responded Mizo, as Rika flinched. "Same I guess. In job terms I mean. They probably have my pain too, just too masked and 'mAtuRE' to realize it when looking at their daughter." answered Rika, as she looks almost jealous.

"Ah yeah. Oh, and just to be clear.. I'm also ADHD-I and Autistic. And the reason I said, they support me is not to make you sadder, is to say that being neurodivergent doesn't make you worse, but only when people hate on you and hurt you because of that, does it start to make you worse. Like, if you lived with.. impostor syndrome let's say, for years because you believed everyone who criticized you, getting out the rut is hard without actual outside validation and support, and I feel you don't like thinking you're reliant on someone, but.. that is just how love, platonic, or romantic works." said Mizo, as Rika nodded and sighs once more, looking up to the sky.

"I.. yeah.. I don't know what I should do.. It's not like reflecting on it will change anything, at least.. not much. My parents often say to persevere.. But, well.. It depends.. I honestly don't know what I would be, tomorrow. Maybe I'd be somewhat happy or depressed. Who knows? Not me. You know.. I hate to admit to being.. indulgent, but.. not only do I escape through art, and cuts.. but also sex. I just realized it.. Why.. why do I like.. being.. taken? But.. it's more.. inner. Like, maybe I would love to.. uh.." said Rika before she sighs and blushes slightly while covering her eyes. 

"..be submissive. Without the consequences of losing my identity, or my rights.. Since it's just a fantasy, right? But.. the more I lose my healthy coping, the more the sex gets.. deeper and deeper.. into depravity until it really doesn't matter who I am looking at.. I had to release something. I don't know how it feels to.. to be close, I guess. I feel so.. foreign and out of my league every time we get closer, Mizo.. To whatever romantic and sexual boundaries we find ourselves in.. To have release while being alone and depressed is like a temporary relief, you're in the zone of.. activity." continued Rika, as she shakes her head and rubs her hands.

"Agh.. I know that feeling..!! It's so tempting to ignore anything else and do instant gratification, which is that. It appeals to your brain, and helps you release.. Yeah.. No wonder it's so easy to fall into addiction. As for.. the relationship.. I.. all I can do is offer my emotions up to you, and see how you respond. I know you have a tough family life. Just.. remember, you have me, okay? Whatever happens. You just.. have to trust a person. I know.. it can be hard to, but.. hey, I've been with you for 2 years, we're going to the same senior high school and college, we'll be fine. Though, haha.. about majors, we haven't decided huh?" responded Mizo, as Rika chuckled slightly.

"Tch. Majors? Like I'll ever get into STEM. Another woman out of STEM. I know you at least have a higher score in Math than me, so you'll be fine, me? I don't know where I **could** go. ? I don't have an interest in business, much less accounting.. I'll be lucky if I can join wherever you go. I might not though, so we— I gotta prepare for it. Ah, first member of a family clan to not go into STEM, wow.. that's me!" said Rika, as she smirks. "Then I'll follow you, then. If it has to be like that." said Mizo as Rika chuckles and slaps him playfully. "Dummy, don't ruin your future like that.. My future's bleak already, least I can do is give you one." commented Rika, as the two laughed.

"Oh don't worry. I'll help you now then.. but.. Rika, do you have anything else to say?" asked Mizo as Rika looked away and turned serious again. "Well.. what else? I've revealed my inner insecurities, and have become vulnerable to you.. Only time will tell if anything regarding my parents, school or society will change. Anyway, a massive.. heavy weight has been lifted. Can we go back to you kissing me and me acting all flustered..?" responded Rika, with a sarcastic tone as Mizo smirked and replied, "Well, you'd gotten used to it... Besides, it's almost night now anyway. Come on, let's go to your home and play some 'Wavey Waves'."

"Oh? I heard you stop—" said Rika as she turned around but Mijo kissed her there. Rika instantly melted and they maintained the kiss until Mijo pulled back. "stopped.. I said stopped.. Mmnnn.. anyway. I'm not going to..? Wha..?" stammered Rika as Mizo pulled her to the wall. "I.. uh..? Thought we were supposed to be playing, Mizo.. Not fucking in the top floor of... huh, wait. Have I told you, my first.. uh.. kiss wasn't you?" commented Rika as Mizo pulled back in amusement. "Well.. I wasn't thinking about that, what's the story though?" asked Mizo, putting his hands on his side.

"Remember that boy I was with before we started to become actual best friends..? Before this grading. That motherfucker, so remember... after the school event during that time... The dumb 'end of the year' party.. Me and him decided to chill in this spot actually.. Well, apparently he had the desire of you, but none of the gentleness. Let's just say.. He did the thing, I was embarrassed and ashamed of it.. then managed to.. push him back, and never interacted with him since then. That's why I was so ecstatic when I saw you, hanging out by the door like a loner." explained Rika as she put her hand on his shoulder. 

"Hays.. it's.. it's old news now at this point. I was still the flustered virgin back then, so a lot of.. intense buried emotions, revealed itself. Past, is in the past.. Nowadays, I avoid him because of that... I'm guessing he has learned from that.. but I don't know." continued Rika as she sighs when she looks at Mizo's face, a bit conflicted. "Alright, I'm just curious.. Also, why did you suddenly remember? I am quite concerned why all the times we kissed, today?." responded Mizo, as Rika blushes. "I just remembered... Okay? Similar place.. different person. L—let's move on already, I swear.. it's.. it was definitely embarrassing but.. I've moved on from it, besides..! He's gone from this school now! Heard he moved away from the city... Don't know why." explained Rika as she grabbed Mizo's hands. 

Mizo nods before Rika is dragged by Mizo to go to her home. "Alright then.. Let's move on from that.. Besides, that hot male character just released~!" said Mizo, as Rika blushed. "H—hey! Stop using my words against me..! B—but fine. It's not like you're not itching either, you still don't have that phoenix woman character, dummy. So! We're competing who's the most lucky in the gacha game. Since I'm clearly the better gamer." said Rika, as Mizo smiled. "Oh? We'll see." said Mizo as they continue on their walk.

**_Even after all this time.. this amount of.. help.. Am I..?_**

Rika stands at the spot she knows all too well. The spot near the balcony where she managed to survive multiple self-harm incidents. The one where all her past trauma haunts her like a spectre. "In the sun.. I feel as one.. In the sun.." muttered Rika as she goes silent when she knows what comes next.

**_Married. Buried._**

"All in all is all we are.." continued Rika before going silent as the song stopped playing and she was left alone with her thoughts. 

**_Everything's my fault._**

Rika is silent as she looks around herself. The razor doesn't seem too bad to use again, but she didn't bring it. Not that she didn't want to, it was just she forgot to, not like she cared by this point. The hot sunny afternoon left her feeling burned already.

**_Now playing, 'You Know You're Right'_**

Rika instantly freezes as she hears it play, she knew it would happen, because she played it but even the reaction was a bit unexpected and heart-pumping. 

**_I will never bother you.. I will never promise to.. I will never follow you.. I will never bother you.._**

Rika instinctively looks at her photo of her and Mizo taken by Kari during Valentine's Day. "W—wait.. n—no.. I—if.. if I leave.. what will happen?  Wait.. w—what if he does..? N—no.. no.." muttered Rika, breaking down, as tears form.

**_Never speak a word again. I will crawl away for good.. I will move away from here, You won't be afraid of fear._**

Rika is silent as she completely breaks down, holding her phone tightly like Mizo was there. She knows Mizo is likely just busy or tired, but the separation and how dependent she is on him, makes it all the painful to face being alone. Alone with, and the battle against herself.

**_No thought was put into this and always knew it would come to this.. Things have never been so swell, I have never failed to fail.._**

Rika is silent, she feels the world spinning as she feels the near sense of unconsciousness come.

**_Hey, pain, hey, You know you're right..
You know you're right, you know you're right._**

Rika falls unconscious.

_Hours later.._

**_I'm not like them, but I can pretend.. The sun is gone, but I have a light..! The day is done, but I'm havin' fun.. I think I'm dumb or maybe just happy.. Think I'm just happy.._**

"Ugh..?" asked Rika to herself as she woke to 'Dumb' playing on her ear. "It's almost night.. 18:00.." said Rika as she stood up and looked around her, she might have spent long hours unconscious.

"I should go home..." said Rika as she looked around her again. "God.. Why do everywhere I look.. ugh.. my eyes.." said Rika as she rubs her eyes. "Feels like something's in my eye.. can't get it off.." muttered Rika, as she moved out to go back down. "God.. everything's blurry.. can't even.. ugh.." continued Rika as her phone buzzed with a message. "I pray to god whoever that is, is Mizo.. Since.. I'm not responding." said Rika, as she sighed. "Everything has to be fucking rushed and fucking done and.. fucking be doing something, I just wanna die." said Rika, as she grabbed the razor.

"You know.. if you weren't.. one of my only happiness.. I would've thrown you away by now." said Rika, shaking as she hesitates to press on it. "I don't fucking know where Mizo is. I don't even remember if he went to school. All I know is.. I forced myself to go, and as expected, a sense of numbness and detachment started to creep up." continued Rika as she hid the razor. 

"Sometimes.. I would feel happy for the dumbest of things. But.. it's not permanent. Every time I look into the mirror, I see someone.. deep in trauma, and a depression so  encompassing that no months can fix, only years." mused Rika, as she started walking down the hallway. "This week's a disaster. From beginning to end. A crash-out, a burnout and now wallowing in so much anger for myself and everyone... The most empathetic people collapse under the weight of the apathy around them." said Rika as she walked with barely any strength and hope left.

**_Where am I going?_**

"Why am I still here? He's not.. going, I've checked. Something something 'shit hits the fan'.. As it turns out.. Being overtly reliant on someone will backfire. Ugh. I'll never learn my lesson." said Rika as she is waiting for.. Mizo apparently, inside a super mall, sitting on a plastic chair.

Rika sat there, feeling relentless but too tired to act on it, when a message buzzed, and.. it was Mizo, again. "What.. why.. again? You just told me you weren't going today..?" asked Rika to herself before opening the message;

**_Leave Out All the Rest by Linkin Park_**

"I dreamed, I was missing.. You were so scared, but no one would listen 'cause no one else cared.."

"W—what.." said Rika, tears already forming as she remembers the song and melody came to her brain.

"After my dreaming, I woke up with this fear, What am I leaving, when I'm done here?"

"I—I don't know.. I don't know what you'll leave me with, i—if.. if.. you're done.. with me." said Rika, as she wipes her tears away.

"So if you're asking me, I want you to know.. When my time comes, forget all the wrong I've done, help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.."

"I.. I don't think you've.. no.. I'm lying.. Of course you've made mistakes.. Of course.. I.. just can't see you being wrong.. When you've helped me.. live." commented Rika as she took a moment to calm herself down, her tears so obvious and eyes so puffed. Then, she continued.

"Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty.. Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest.. Leave out all the rest."

"I..! I.. promise.. I.. fuck.. me... I don't resent you! It may have looked like it, but please. Please...! I haven't.. I.. I promise.. I.. wanna.. I want to.. I.." trailed off Rika, as she silently sobbed.

"Don't be afraid. I've taken my beating, I've shared what I've made.. Strong on the surface, not all the way through. Never been perfect, but neither have you.."

"I.. I know! I know.. I know you're.. suffering too, I... just can't.. get my guilt off of myself. I.. can't help you, if I can't help myself. I'm sorry, we should be reciprocating help and love.. not.. burdened by each other.. More you are burdened by me.." replied Rika, as she held her blouse tight.

"W—wait.. why is this.. is this my part..?" asked Rika as she looked at the blank verse, remembering what was there.

"Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well, pretending someone else can come and save me from myself, I can't be who you are.."

"Can't be who you are.. is.. this for both of us? I.. I am.. I.. I'm so.. selfish for.. looking at myself only.. I.. keep.. no.. I.. please.. just don't.. leave me.. How.. do I save me from myself..?" said Rika, as she closed her phone and looked off the distance, looking reflective and better, better than before at least.

"Hm? What's buzzing..?" asked Rika as she looked at her phone, and saw a particularly hilarious and random philosophical essay. Rika instantly snapped out of her depressive episode for a moment to laugh before returning. "W—what..? Why.. why do I have notifs on anyway? H—hold on.. Iet me save it for later.. I.. have to respond." said Rika as she saved the post and closed the app as she muses on what to do.

## Aftershocks and Paper Cuts

### Author's Note:

Recovery is hard, but so is staying wounded.

"As I look at you, I see someone who hesitates and hates herself. I do not want you to be like that. I want you to be strong, independent and strong willed. Honestly, you deserve better girl, but.. the world's cruel, your parents.. school.. Just gotta live it, I guess."

_At a super mall, two particular people are chilling, sitting on plastic chairs, while getting cold by the air conditioning.._

"Even if you have a cold still, you can cough on me again.." said Mizo, as Rika was using her handkerchief and coughing. "Hey..! That sounds.. disgusting out of context.." replied Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Ah? It's metaphorical. Besides, you know the song. I'm guessing it's what you're feeling right now?" responded Mizo, as Rika chuckled and playfully slapped his arm. "Shut up... Hays. It's been a while.. since.. that day." said Rika as she looked at Mizo. 

"Oh, yeah. Well, we're done with.. that section of our life, you know. The 2 year research project of the school, finally done. All that's left is for the expo." said Mizo, as Rika shook her head. "N—no not the final oral defense presentation earlier.. What I mean is.." said Rika as her face goes neutral. "The.. day when you sent me t—**that** message." continued Rika as she looked away.

"Oh. Yeah. Well.. what else can I say?" asked Mizo as Rika shrugs, looking back. "Don't know.  Honestly, I.. was just.. very.. very.." trailed off Rika, as Mizo spoke up. "I know.. I was too. You didn't respond, but.. I had a feeling." Rika shuddered a bit before she nodded. "Y—yeah.. You know, I'm.. just.. exhausted." responded Rika as she slumped on her chair. Rika and Mizo go silent for a while.

"I'm.. tired. Of everything. My.. emotions run through me in a flash. Moments.. dazzle leaves me drained." said Rika as she looked around her. "Fuck me man, I've been fighting for months now.. But I feel everyone staring me down. Fishing my problems out, and criticizing it. I've done so many wrongs.. So many. I feel nothing. When's it time to quit? I don't know. I don't know." continued Rika before she sighed and looked at Mizo, her eyes once full of affection and love fading away under immense pressure. 

"I mean.. it's only three weeks left, and the major parts are mostly done, now.." said Mizo, before Rika interrupted. "That's the worst part. I hate that weeks pass, I still haven't done necessary work. I don't know what to do. Lost all motivations, all hope and at this point, I'm expecting to fail. They think I don't deserve it, and.. they've made it sure through breaking me.  Like, fuck me. I feel.. that I'm the one that's guilty. I've tried anything. But.. parents.. fall into line. And.. fuck me. I've given up on everything." said Rika, as she started shaking.

"I think.. you.. need a break. A real break. Just.. a sense of.. peace. Come, with me for a while. At least.. make your peace, with the pain and dread." assured Mizo, as he went closer and held her hand. "Let's see.. If there's one thing I embrace, it's.." said Rika before blushing. "you."  Mizo smiled and kissed her on the cheeks before pulling back. "Bastard.. Hey, I.. don't see my circumstances changing, but.. I'll try anyway. Every zero on the paper, is.. a step to the future, whatever that may be. I.. realize that not.. thinking, nor facing the future.. isn't.. particularly a healthy cope." continued Rika, as Mizo was about to say something but leaned in for a kiss when Rika leaned a bit closer. 

They embraced for a while before Rika pulled back. "Honestly, I don't think I'll change my.. self-destructive shame and guilt.. Well, not this year at least. But, what I hope.. is that.. I'll be.. happy by then. Even if.. those are dazzling fleeting moments. Parents' say I make myself miserable, but... living _is_ miserable. They say I have no discipline, no fear, and are bogged down by the tiniest of things." said Rika softly, in an almost reflective tone. "Welp. Deal with it.. There's.. so many, yet.. who cares now? I've been broken many times, maybe it's time I should stop people from letting them break me. They want action? I'll give 'em action. Good or bad, it's just me now. Besides, my own self-hatred prevents my ego from getting too large. Anyways, Mizo! We shou—" continued Rika, before Mizo kissed her in the lips again.

"Mmmnn~! Nngh.." Rika embraced the kiss as Mizo got closer and pulled back his kiss. "Gotta.. stop.. surprising me.. Mizo.. you're lucky.. I like you, dummy." commented Rika, as Mizo smiled and stood up, as they got their bags. "Like I said.. I'll keep surprising you, whenever. Now, where do you want to go?" asked Mizo, as Rika smirked and looked at him directly, affectionately. "Well.. I—" Rika says before gasping at a sudden hug that made her blush harder. "Mizo..!! Mizo.. Hey.. can't.. keep.. abusin' your **boyfriend** privileges.. wait, shit.. no!! I didn't— damn.." said Rika as Mizo pulled back and Rika was super red and embarrassed.

"Nevermind. I—Ignore that, Mizo! L—let's go! I.. have to make use of our limited time, yea?" continued Rika, as Mizo smirked and nodded. Rika sighed in relief before Mizo grabbed her hands and they moved, with Rika leading them to a bookstore.

## What I've Gotta Do?

### Author's Note:

"Lights are on, but nobody's home..?"

Certain things work out, yet complicated stuff doesn't resolve within a month. Talking.. to whom? Yourself? Other people? Better to find out than die with regrets.

_Current Track: Talking to Myself by Linkin Park is playing..._

"Rika..? Where are you..?" asked Mizo as he looked around the school, while trying to call her by her phone. "Damn it.. just tell me if you're sick or something.. I'm.. supposed to be going home.." added Mizo, while waiting at a random spot in the school. The phone buzzed but no one picked up. "Rika..! I'm.. patient but if you don't pick up, I'll have to go home. Please.. please pick up.." muttered Mizo, as he called again.

"H—hello..? I—Is this Mizo..?" asked Rika, her voice cracking as she sniffled. "I—I'm so sorry.. I went home after the exam today.. I—I'm not going to the filming as well.. I—I'm sorry for not answering.. I—I.. sorry.." cracked Rika before she called off. "I.." Mizo sighs as he puts his phone in his sling bag, and leaves school.

_At Rika, playing By Myself by Linkin Park.._

Rika is holding her pillow tightly as she shakes and abruptly hits herself at the wall to the right of her before crying more. Rika is barely breathing, the old wounds hurting again for an unknown reason, while her voice is torn, after screaming to herself earlier.

_What do I do to ignore them behind me? Do I follow my instincts blindly?_

"I don't know.. stop asking.." answered Rika to herself as she tightened her hold. "Stupid.. stupid grades.. Why am I so hung up.. fuck! Fu—" said Rika before she got cut off by her own coughing. "I—It doesn't matter.. It's not important.. It's not important.." repeated Rika to herself before jerking herself to her floor, and expectedly, hitting her body. She remained on the floor though, gasping and short of breath.

_I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin! With thoughts of failure sinking in..!_

Rika forced herself to sleep, shutting out the memories of the day. "Research.. filming.. pt.. must.. mmn..." mumbled Rika before falling unconscious.

_Rika... Rika..? Hey.. Rika..! Love..?_

"Mmmnn..?" mumbled Rika, as she opened her eyes to a Mizo, very close to her face and was brushing her hair. "You're awake.. Didn't think you'd actually wake up though.. I.. was concerned, but hey, I headed home.. then went to your house. Don't worry. Just.. relax, tomorrow's the last day." said Mizo, as Rika tried moving around. "H—how.. did you.. get in.." asked Rika, as Mizo looked away with an awkward smile. "Your bedroom was unlocked. I have a copy of your house key, that you gave.. around our anniv—" explained Mijo, as Rika shook him before he could continue. "Stop stop.. I remember.." muttered Rika as she pushed him slightly to get up a bit.

"What happened..? What time's it..?" asked Rika, as Mizo checked his phone. "19:00.. it's been six hours since I called you. Good sleep..?" answered Mizo, with a faint smile. "Don't know.. don't remember.." said Rika, as she grabbed her pillow and blanket to organize them. "Mizo.." said Rika before Mizo interrupted her, "It's fine. I don't.. expect you to be fine all the time, y'know? Besides, I had a fun time with Kari..." said Mizo, hesitating on his next words as he looked at Rika closely.

"Kari.. yeah.. she's.. a good friend.. G—good.. y—you can have fun without me.. It's fine.. mhm.." said Rika, her voice cracking. "Hey! Not that.. I'm saying adding you wouldn't be better.. But! I'm not implying you're jealous.. okay?" blurted out Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Hey.. I'm.. the one who's supposed to say that.. indirect jabs.." responded Rika as she looked away. "I—I'm not opposed to it, I like Kari too! But.. yeah, w—wouldn't you be jealous if I went with like.. uh.. Leviente or.. yeah, Mijo without you?" asked Rika, as Mizo smiled as he blushed slightly. "Well.. as long as they respect boundaries, it's.. fine, I mean.. if you theoretically like them more, I'm fine with that." answered Mizo, as Rika pondered.

"So.. you like being cucked?" asked Rika, as Mizo smiled. "Hm? We're not fucking though. Besides, we're still.. young y'know. I don't want to force you to do anything, even as we grow older. But.. honestly, I'd say no, because.. uh.. well if you liked a man so much you'd be willing to get pregnant, which is already so far-fetched.. I'd respect that and move on, what else can I do anyway?" responded Mizo, as Rika flinched at the word 'pregnant'. "O—okay..! Okay! That's.. just a theory..! A Life Theory! T—that won't happen. I was joking, jeez.. D—did you think it before or something? Why do you have an entire paragraph of an answer?!" exclaimed Rika, as she was smirking yet her eyes were widened, staring into Mijo's eyes.

"I would be lying if I said no. I'm a writer, Rika.. Sometimes I think about theoreticals.. It just so happens to be that." answered Mizo with a smirk. "Fuckin.. I.. shit.. I didn't know you were that.. bold! But.. ugh.. just imagining you gooning to smut about me.." said Rika, as Mizo raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Who said I was doing that but you? I mean, I do write.. smut, but who said I was written with you, in mind?" questioned Mizo, as Rika blushed slightly. "Don't act innocent!! I.. I.. you know, you're straight and all, and guys always.. have.. ugh. You get it!! Don't make me say it...!" responded Rika, as Mizo chuckled and pulled back. "To answer, yes, but.. it's a weird dissonance. You know how your horny mind differs from normal, gets you down bad **hard**.." said Mijo, as Rika sighed and grabbed her phone to calm down.

_The room is silent as Mijo silently goes to her side and also starts using his phone..._

"Hey.. dude." said Rika as she turned to face him. "I.. I've been distant for the past couple of days.. A—and.. not that.. y—you.. please.. d—don't.. reassure me. I—I don't need it. I just.. don't feel the urge to talk to you, and.. well, I've just seen it.. and ignored it. I'm.. not even feeling bad about it, just.. an observation.", continued Rika, as Mizo thought about it, putting his phone down. "Then.. why did you talk?" asked Mizo, as Rika looked down into her hands and legs. 

"I.. don't.. know what to feel about it. Yeah, I.. think we're.. inseparable, but.. I feel.. I don't know.. I don't feel happy nor guilty.. I've.. realized, I.. don't know how to.. navigate **any** of this. And.. I guess, I feel resigned. To whatever this is." explained Rika as Mizo moved closer and patted her head, which made Rika blush and she put his hand away. "Eh.. mmnn.. and.. this is another thing.. This whole intimacy thing, are we even friends? couples? I don't know.." continued Rika, as she nuzzled closer to Mizo's chest without realizing.

"We're us, you know. We decide on what relationship this is. I.. don't want to force you, so I keep this dynamic, until you decide. Me? As long as we have this.. bond, I'm fine with whatever happens, like I said." said Mizo, as Rika nodded. "I.. ugh.. I don't know.. if this was a romance, I'm like that girl not putting in any effort while you carry the burden.. I want to be there for you like you are for me, I.. just don't know how to start.." responded Rika, as she nuzzled even deeper, getting the attention of Mizo, with a slight blush.

"For a girl confused about her friend, you're.. awfully close.." said Mizo, as Rika tightened her hold on Mizo's shirt. "H—hey.. it's..  uh.. like.. a friend.. hug.. yeah.. this happens.. right?" responded Rika more softly while her blush intensifies. "Supposedly." said Mizo, as Rika drifted off to sleep, too exhausted to face her emotions and life head-on. "Mmm.." said Mizo, as he also fell asleep, holding Rika tight.

## Given Up

Woah, a reprisal of this title.. anyways. No spoilers, title's enough.

um.. **_disturbing suicidal themes warning._**

_Wake in a sweat again, another day's been laid to waste.._

"Ugh.." said Rika before she coughed heavily. She barely got sleep due to her coughinhg episodes, for whatever reason, it was too hot, when it was just her sleeping, the electric fans were not helping. "Did I.. no.. fuck me.. again and again.." muttered Rika, as she got out of bed weakly. She headed to the living room, where breakfast was prepared. Her phone was low battery, so she charged it while watching from it and also eating. 

'Anything to distract from myself..' 

After she ate, she went to take a shower, but it was more of a coughing fit than an actual shower as she stayed there and tried to get all the phlegm out just by coughing and getting them out that way. Eventually, her breathing was stable enough to not cough every minute, but she still had a cold and cough. "Mmnn.. fuck everything.." murmured Rika to herself as she went out and dressed in her schoolgirl uniform. "Damn it.. why am I even going to school? I'm.. so.. tired.. and.. school's pretty much over.. Haven't even.. done any missings, what's the point?" asked Rika to herself before being pulled by her parents to ride to school.

On the way there, she blacked out until they were close and she was dropped off. "Didn't even get to organize my bag.. Why..? Why can't I just be sick and be done with it? Why do I have to physically and mentally collapse before so..?" asked Rika to herself as she entered the school, the monday ceremony was happening and she ignored it and went to her classroom, expecting it to be empty, but there were a few fellow classmates there. Mizo wasn't there though.

'Must be late.. he really doesn't care about it.. Ugh.. wish my parents said the same.'

_In my disgrace, **stuck** in my head again, there's no escape.. I'm my own worst **enemy**.._

She sat down and scrolled through her phone, of course, she couldn't even go to her Mastodon to look at yuri/lesbian posting or PeerTube for more pointless gacha drama. "Damn it.. that.. father.." said Rika as she messaged her father, hoping to get some mobile data, as hers ran out a long long time ago, about a month ago. "If I just asked him during Sunday Morning.. I could've.. 1.18 Gigabytes.. what.. what is wrong with me.." said Rika as she frustratedly put her phone down and sighed, she learnt from a fellow classmate, no explosive mental breakdown. Just silent ones, that don't affect anyone else, except Mizo.

"Why.. why can't I go home early? What am I doing here for? Mizo isn't here.. I don't have anyone else, my grades are shown lower and lower.. what the **fuck** am I doing.." Rika cut herself off as she remembered her razor. "Mmnn.. no. no. no. no..." said Rika as she felt the urge again, she didn't want to fulfill it, again. "Please..! I don't want to." said Rika, but she was spiraling, as messages popped out;

"Missing PT2, WW3 & 4 for [sPe]" | "Missing PT2 and Quiz 2 for [pNOfIIl]" | "75 for [hTMa]." | "Missing PT2, comply before going out of school." |

'Failure.'

"Don't care.. can't.. do it.. Stop.. get out of my head.." said Rika, as she got up and left the classroom. She was going somewhere she doesn't even know, just away from the cursed classroom that gave her the scars she has, literally and figuratively. "Get.. out.." said Rika as she arrived at the CR, and went inside, locking herself inside one of the stalls. Everything smelled bad, period blood, piss and shit everywhere. "Fuck.. is this the best.. agh.. why am I here?! Someone will come here, and I'll have to face them. Where.." said Rika, as she quickly left the CRs and headed wherever in the school.

_I've **given up.** I'm sick of feeling, is there nothing you can say?_

"Come on, come on.. just give me data already.. it's been hours since.. ughh... Mmnn.. need it.." said Rika as she obsessively looked at her phone and at the app that contained her data promos and other carrier-related stuff. "Mizo.. are you even going to school?? It's.. 9:15.. where are you..?" asked Rika to herself as she went to her classroom again, and sat down.

"Grades.. grades.. it's always about the fucking numbers.. Fuck you, and fuck me for letting this happen. Good at nothing girl, I should've killed you when I had the chance.." said Rika to herself, as she looked around her, everyone.. is having fun. 

'Of course, they're the ones who have friends, data and no missing. While I'm sitting here... wallowing in my own misery, acting like.. everyone's out to get me. Have you ever thought where that pain comes from, huh Dad?'

"Nothing makes sense anymore.. Everything's gone to shit.. And I'm left with no way to advance forward. My only one chance shattered by myself. Fuck me fuck me... can't I just live...? Fuck me, do I have to suffer each and every way of the school steps? LET ME DIE ALREADY." said Rika, as she looked around, dead inside, yet no one even batted an eye towards herself. She looked down on expectations that were met, yet she hoped it wouldn't be.

_Take this all away.. I'm suffocating, tell me what the **FUCK** is wrong, with me?!_

"Rika?" asked a familiar voice and figure. "Mizo!!" exclaimed Rika as she hugged him tight, he reciprocated but pulled back. "So excited.. I was late, hehe.. had to do some quick missing, and.. looks like it's all I can do, haha!" said Mizo, as he looked at Rika closely, with dried out tears and more tears on the way. "You.. have.. to.. mmnn.." said Rika as she trailed off, sighing not knowing what to say.

"To what? I.. can see you're clearly.. hurt, but lemme just put my bags down, okay?" said Mizo, as Rika nodded and let him go. He went to his chair and placed his bags down as Rika approached him. "This school sucks.. I wanna go home so bad.. fucking hell.. I don't want to worry anymore, I just wanna be happy.. fuck.. everything's.. a problem.. Mizo.." murmured Rika as she hugged Mizo tight. "Hey, hey it's fine.. Just calm down with me, you'll be fine. Not the end of the world if you fail this, okay?" Mizo kissed her on her forehead as he slightly pulled back.

"This.. won't solve anything.. but.. it feels so good anyway.." muttered Rika as she looked at Mizo's face while her left hand was hovering over her face. "That's the point.. Besides, it's not like.. worrying about it will help, if you didn't do it, so be it. Do what you can, whatever that is." responded Mizo, as Rika's phone buzzed. "Oh.." said Rika as she looked at her phone, she finally received the data she asked for, but it felt hollow after asking for it for the past three hours.

"Hm? Oh right.. Well.. why don't we sit down and just talk, forget school for a moment." said Mizo, as he sat down and Rika hesitantly followed him. "Okay, alright.. Whew.." said Rika, as she heard a certain song play.

_My Girl's a Dere, a Tsu— Tsundere~_

"Hey, your theme song—" said Mizo, as he cut himself off expecting a slap, but he was looking at a Rika smirking. Then she slapped him on the face, when he was unguarded. "Hah!  Shush. I'm.. eh.. You're not allowed to say that, hmmph." said Rika, blushing but also smirking. "Wow, surprising me? What a shock. Anyways, what about your.. gacha account?" asked Mizo, as Rika thought about it. "Both games are super laggy on my laptop.. But I've been playing Wavey more because it's more fun.. Besides, there's nothing to do in Honkers Railway, until the game's anniversary.." answered Rika, reflecting on her quite frustrating moments getting the games to run on Linux.

## Just A Scar

### Author's Note:

Despite the title, it's quite wholesome (as much as traumatized people can be wholesome, I guess)

"The mall huh? What are you planning this time, dear Rika?" asked Mizo, as they walked on the supermall's second floor. "It's not a date okay! It's.. a hangout. Um, I really have nothing to celebrate, anyway. I just wanted to walk around, I guess. We can go home later." said Rika, as Mizo nodded while smirking. "We've been here before, a lot of times. I... kinda want to distract myself from my cough too.." said Rika before coughing onto her handkerchief.

"Hey have you heard of this tip?" asked Mizo randomly, conspicuously hiding his phone. "Huh? Um.. you haven't even sai—" responded Rika, before Mizo interrupted her. "When a girl doesn't change her eye color or eye shape into hearts, while climaxing, she's faking it?" Rika immediately held Mizo on his arm, and tilted her head with a slight grin. "W—what..? Uhuh.. so does it only apply to girls?" retorted Rika, before Mizo looked directly in her eyes. "Mhm. I found this out from a novel that featured a male teacher sleeping with girl stu—" said Mizo, before Rika held his hand tight to stop him.

"Stop... stop.. that's way too far, I get it.. It came from a young girl who is completely unaware of how sex actually works?" asked Rika as Mizo answered with a tilt from left-to-right, unsure. "I don't know, author is unknown since the novel was so bad. Besides, **you** don't know how sex works either." answered Mizo, as Rika smirked and lightly pushed Mizo. "Hm? Little virgin boy talking hm?" said Rika with a smirk and slight blush before looking away and coughing. "Anyways.. let's get that topic out before I burst." said Rika, as Mizo nodded and they continued walking.

"So.. everything's chill now right?" asked Mizo, as Rika nodded. "Mostly. I mean, there are a few things I want to resolve.. But, other than that.. I'd say yeah, since school doesn't affect me as much now. No wonder.." answered Rika, as Mizo shook Rika, making her stop. "Hey..! What was that fo—" exclaimed Rika, before she was kissed by Mizo, before quickly pulling back. "M—Mizo.. that.." muttered Rika, super flustered before coughing suddenly into her handkerchief. "I would've let you, you know.. If I wasn't still sick. But.." continued Rika before looking at Mizo.

"You like surprising me, dummy. And.. I.." said Rika, as Mizo smirks and leans closer. "H—hey...! Move back a bit.. Mmmnn.. I like it, okay..! There, stop getting into my face like you're about to kiss me again, I'm warning you, you're going to get sick if you try that again, hmph!" continued Rika, as Mizo gently kisssed her on the cheeks before Rika pulls him into a hug. "I'm not letting you lead this fully.. dummy.." said Rika, locked into the hug before pulling back.

"Ugh.. Embarrassing to call you affectionately 'dummy' but.. that's how it's going to be I guess, come on.. let's go then." said Rika, as Mizo grabbed her arm and ran to the ice cream stall in the super mall. "Ah?! Hey!" said Rika, before they stopped at the stall. "Two DayDream Classic please, cookies and cream.. Yes, largest cup size." said Mizo, before suspiciously looking at Rika, but not into her eyes. "What.. are you..?" asked Rika, blushing more before Mizo gives the 150₱ payment to the ice cream vendor as she makes them the product.

"Nothing~ anyways, what do you do here anyway before we started going together last month?" asked Mizo, as Rika was processing what Mizo was doing. "I was.. um.. damn it. Why.. I don't.." blurted out Rika, as the two got their ice cream cup and left to go back upstairs to the chairs. "Guh.. Fuck.. Alright.. First off, what was that about cup size? I get it.. but.. what was that look?" asked Rika, still blushing.

"Hm? What could refer to a cup size besides a cup?" asked Mizo leaning close, as Rika blushed. "WHAT?!" exclaimed Rika as she pushed Mizo back a bit, making him stumble before regaining his balance as Rika is still blushing and is now very very irritated. "What.. what did you say?" asked Rika, looking at Mizo, like she was betrayed. Mizo's face immediately went soft and looked at Rika seriously. "Rika.." said Mizo, as he felt also speechless from her reaction. The two walked to the chairs, as Rika put her ice cream cup down on the chair.

"I..! Nothing.. ugh.. I.." said Rika as she went to the railings, trying to calm herself down. "Hey.. Rika, I didn't mean to insult you, or.. make you angry, okay? I thought it.. was funny, guess not."  asked Mizo, hesitating to touch her as he moved closer. "I.. ugh. It's.. ugh.. Can I just say what I'm thinking, without.. judgement, for a minute?" asked Rika, also feeling conflicted. "Go on. I won't." responded Mizo, as Rika sighs. "It's.. my fault for not teling you that.. that I have some.. insecurities. It's.. it's just.. nothing. Really. I just.. I'm not.. comfortable with having.. this.. body type. I guess. I haven't.. thought about it much because of my other issues.. But.. ugh.. I'm.. really sorry for getting this.. angry over some stupid boobs joke." explained Rika, before sighing again as she brushes her hair. She is looking down on the people below walking around the super mall.

"Hey, it's.. my fault alright? Just.. let's chill here for a while, Rika." said Mizo, as he noticed Rika's eyes form tears. Rika nods as she picks up her ice cream cup and starts eating silently, as Mizo sits down nearby and eats silently as well. After a while, Rika turns around and sits down. Her dried up tears quickly being hidden by her handkerchief as she uses it. Then the two finish their ice cream as Mizo offers, "I'll throw them away, stay here.." before leaving with the cups.

"Mizo.." murmured Rika, as she looks around. "Why can't I just.. exist.. Even this.." continued Rika, as she looks down and put her hands on her head. "Maybe.. maybe not.. I don't know.." said Rika, before going silent as she looked more closely to her body, ever since the year started she's been neglecting her health and she doesn't feel or look 'good' to herself. "It's.. been.. a while. Yet, I don't feel relieved to have time to improve myself... Just.. exhaustion." said Rika to herself before a hand is placed on her shoulder, likely Mizo. "I'm fine Mi—" said Rika, before Mizo kissed her on the lips.

Rika is surprised but doesn't pull back, as Mizo pulls her up. Mizo pulls back to a blushing yet quiet Rika. "Damn you.." said Rika, with a slight smile as she is put down. "Let's.. leave that in the past. Come on, I have a place to go to.." said Rika as she looked at Mizo, then to the store she impulsively decided on. "Just.. I don't know, keep joking until I get angry again? I don't want to lose this special thing between us, okay?" said Rika, before getting her bags. Then she heads to the store nearby, while Mizo silently follows her.

## Love Herself?

### Author's Note:

I've been working on the main for a while, but I have a.. something to tell. 

Cycling cycles, but.. does she actually.. love herself?

_Rika is staring at a pink wall, looking at it absent-mindedly.._

"What did I do wrong, why didn't I do this, why am I here, he should die. No, I should die. Fuck him, Kill this fucker. Fucker. Die. Die. Die." thought Rhida, as she shakily grabbed her phone and played her.. favorite Nirvana song.

_You are now playing: You Know You're Right_

Rika couldn't shake away the fact that her anger, and trauma came back because of this stupidity. At least, she thinks. "Won't.. you fucking believe it.. can't even fucking calm down.. fuck.. me. Every fucking damn time.. I should have shouted, yelled and fought.. Damn.. motherfucker.. Kill me, kill him, kill her. Fuck.. WHY CAN'T _THEY_ LEAVE ME ALONE?!" shouted Rika, before gasping and retreating into her pink pillows and blanket. "No no.. I shouldn't.. no no.." said Rika, as she covered her ears and started to hear voices on the back of her head.

~~| Hey, what was that? | Hey, are you fine? | You're normal, why not tonight? | I'm here, my **daughter..**~~

"Please.. go away, leave me alone! Please please please.." muttered Rika to herself, as she tried to close her ears and eyes away. 

~~| Are you good? | Are you fine? | You need help. | Why so irritated? | Why so sad? | Unreasonably stubborn headed immature fool!~~

_A tight hug envelops her._

"Mnnn?!! Mmnnn!!" Rhida instinctively tried to get out of the hug, but when she saw that it was Mizo, she hesitated before relaxing. "Relax, relax.. I'm here, I'm here.." said Mizo, as Rika started crying. "I'm sorry.. Mizo.. is.. just.. me.. being emotional again.." mumbled Rika, as Mijo whispered, "Hey.. it's okay.. okay... you can cry.. I'm right here. Just tell me. I'll be.. fine." Rika cried harder as she felt the need to hold on to someone for a little while longer.

"Is.. it's.. nothing.. no.. that... I.. have nothing to show for my years in school.. Not even a.. fuck me.. I knew it would happen yet why did it— ah!" answered Rika, as Mijo hugged her so tight she got surprised and startled as Mijo slightly pulled back. "Oh? Sorry. I.. uh.. hehe.. so.. um.. you good, girl?" asked Mizo, as Rika was heavily breathing for a while before nodding. "Y—yeah. Uh.. awkward.. a—anyway... yeah.. Gosh.." answered Rika as she sat down, then Mizo followed.

"Ugh. I.. probably should stop worrying about the damn thing. I have.. what, like two months to sort my life out, or something. Besides?" said Rika as she shrugs and flipped her hands palms-up, fingers splayed near her chest. "I have like soo many gacha games to review and play, HAVE YOU SEEN the DMC V x Borb Launcher?!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled and nodded. "Of course. Heard it's CN first though. Global sync isn't in full effect, yet. Who'll you pull? Cheesy gal?" asked Mizo, as he went closer to her face smirking.

Rika is looking back in slight amusement as she slightly blushes and pulls back. "What do you mean? Of course every collab character! I already have Lucia dumb dumb, and I think.. Alpha's free next version, so bleh!" said Rika as she holds her tounge out before the two laughed. After a while, Rika sighs and lays on the bed in her room. "Well.. I know what you're thinking.. or.. just.. ahem.. some.. ***recommendations..*** from others.." said Rika as she closed her eyes. "I imagine.. I'd be doing what I did before.. wasting my time.. and.. of course, doing whatever dumb things you want me to do, 'cause you have a damn novel.. Oh, yeah.. Is that done? Or are you dragging me out to the park to.. 'act out' dialogue? Don't act like some are not *intentional..*" said Rika, then opened her eyes as she looked at Mizo's eyes.

"Oho~ Are you finally noticing my flirtation for real?" asked Mizo, as Rika blushed and looked away. "Shut up! I.. why.." exclaimed Rika, before sighing and continuing softly, "We're.. **'close'**.. I guess. I didn't take it weird, as.. you know, basically everyone thinks we're a couple." Rika sighs again, as Mizo slightly chuckled. "Hey..! I'm not.. ugh. Mmm.. Let's just move on from this **really** awkward talk. I'm not ready for it." said Rika before turning back to Mizo.

"Okay, sure. Um.. are you like.. uh.. satisfied with your current.. situation, Rika?" asked Mizo, as Rika responded. "I don't know, but.. it's all over now. **Finally.** I'll just.. push 'em aside, I guess. You know, all these games, and talks we have, really distract me.. And, I sometimes need that. Thanks, I guess." Rika smiled before turning away. "Now either go home, or stay silent.. I'm sleeping tonight.. tired. Just got from a mental breakdown.." said Rika, as she drifted off to sleep. But not before a response from Mizo, a kiss from him on her cheek that makes her freeze up as she whimpers. "Damn you.. lucky I.. nevermind.. Just go.."  mumbled Rika before grabbing a blanket and covering herself. Mizo leaved shortly after.

## Dental Qualms

### Author's Note:

Big tone shift, but trust me, it's a transition to the next chapter of Mizo/Rika's journey.

So.. I'm dealing with it too, so they're also dealing with that too! (Hehe..)

"Ugh.. man, this sucks.." said Rika as she is **very** focused on trying to move her tooth to not ache her gums. Mizo was busy eating a corn cob before responding, "Hm? Why so? Is the cob bad?" Rika shook her head as she looked at her cob, already eaten. "No, it was so good, my baby tooth is finally falling out. Though, it **fucking** hurts whenever I try to get it out.." said Rika as she tried moving her mouth and visibly jolted when it inevitably hit the tooth. "Go to a dentist.." said Mizo as he looked at her, unamused. "Ah! I.. don't know.. If I should.. I haven't—" answered Rika, as Mizo interrupted. "Go! Ask your damn parents to take you then." said Mizo, as Rika sighs.

"Fiine. I'll.. do it. I guess. It's somethin' they should care. Uh.. before that, can we just chat for a while?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded. "Sure sure.. Whatever you want. Not like I'm the one needing to go to the dentist cause she has an 'achy' tooth.." responded Mizo as both of the two chuckled. "Shush.. I'm just waiting for the right moment, it's the damn afternoon." said Rika, as she crossed her arms. "Well alright... Want to talk about your guitar progress?" asked Mizo, as Rika looked away. "Ugh.. well.. I.. guess I've been practicing chords.. It's tough you know? I can't play electric cause my aunt is at home too.. And.. well.. yeah, electric's loud as shit.. Anyway, I'm trying to do 'Something In The Way' by Nirvana.. Simple Chords for now." responded Rika, before looking back, clearly hiding a blush.

_Later.. Rika in bed, late at night (because of course, she told her parents late at night..)_

"Mmnn.. sleepy.. drama.. in my ears.." Rika mumbles as she listens to a random Wavey Waves streamer talk about whatever pointless drama was going on. Then suddenly, her tooth finally separated, and Rika got woken up and got it before she could accidentally swallow it and got the tooth and processed what just happened.

"What.." Rika mumbled as she got out of bed and put it on her shelf, then pictured it before going back to bed. "Ugh.. what now.. I'm just going to.. ignore it.. then.. awkward.." muttered Rika before going to bed again, sleepy as she drowned out her thoughts in pointless drama yapping through her ears.

_Afternoon, much to the amusement mixed with apprehensiveness of her family, Rika meets up with Mizo at Rika's house._

"Heyo.." Rika waves at Mizo, as they go out of her house, both wearing casual going out clothes. "So.. did you go to the dentist?" asked Mizo, as Rika shook her head. "Ugh.. No, unfortunately. My tooth fell out when I was about to sleep so.. yeah.. see?" answered Rika as she showed the now empty spot on her gums. "I see.." said Mizo as he nodded then kissed her on her temple before pulling back.

Rika didn't acknowledge it but the slight twitch of her fingers and whimper says everything. "Okay.. So.. where are we going?" asked Rika, as Mizo smiled. "My house. Parents are out for the day, don't worry about 'em, they're.. hehe, having fun.." answered Mizo, as Rika narrowed her eyes before chuckling. "Okay.. But what are we doing?" questioned Rika as Mizo looked at her eyes. "Asking so much, now are we? Come on, have fun~" said Mizo before booping her nose as Rika immediately reacted by looking away, now flustered.

"Ah! Cheating.. Fiine.." exclaimed Rika as she looked down. "You know.. Maybe I'll learn to make this summer.. a little less stagnant, even after wasting away for days.. Speaking of that!! Are you interested in making a short story about my stupid ideas?!" continued Rika as Mizo shrugged. "Sure then. But, let me marinate it, alright? A cook takes time to cook." answered Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Finally!! Okay.. I think.. I can let go for a while." said Rika before the two moved on to another topic.

<!--CHAPTER 5. "Oh shit, summer's here and none of our relationship problems got fixed.." or anything, really, but hey, that's life~-->

## Whatever, Nevermind.

### Author's Note:

Well, Rika hopes nothing bad happens, or.. at least, not anything that pulls her back to the depths of the abyss that is her self-confidence and self-esteem..

As Rika grows out of the teen angst she's been trapped in, she sees, that she's just in another shell of adult angst. Damn. She really thought anything else would change..

And well, she's not alone, but.. she doesn't know how to handle herself, how would she handle Mizo? Let's find out.

— jmb~ | April 30, 2025 | 1:52

*Huh. Rika's hair's dyed white..*

"Man.. I've been.. ugh. Super late into the night, indulging in like.. anything.. Ugh... I'm so.. tired.." ranted Rika, as Mizo typed silently on his laptop. "Mhm. Me too." replied Mizo, as he drank more coffee. "Do you have more sweets here or something?" asked Rika, as she looked around for more sustenance. "Check around. But, we haven't gone to the store for a while." said Mizo, as Rika groaned and searched.

"Nothing.." said Rika as she checked the green plastic bag, to find a bunch of eaten wrappings of a particularly sweet series of packets that had sweetened choco powders. "Hmm.." Rika takes the remaining uneaten ones, then goes on a hunt for others. She goes outside of Mizo's room and checks the barrel-like food storages that contain coffee packets, some biscuits, and other foodstuffs kept there. "Smells like plastic.. ugh. But.. there's.. something I can cook up.." commented Rika, before she shrugged and closed the container again.

"Fuck it. I'm just going to starve." said Rika sarcastically to herself, as she heads back inside and flops onto bed. "Man.." said Rika as she looked at her phone, screen off. Rika just stares at it as Mizo's typing blended in with every other sound happening in that room. 

**_"Oh."_**

"Huh what?" jolted Rika as she looked at Mizo, his tense posture and focused look hiding simmering anger. "Nothing. Just some... realization.." said Mizo as Rika looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to elaborate. "Nevermind." said Mizo, before standing out of his swivel gaming chair. "I'm getting some more coffee. You in?" asked Mizo, with a gentle smile contrasting with his eyebags. "Right! Yes, yes let's go!" said Rika before they went together, to outside of Mizo's room. Mizo picked up four coffee packets, then the two headed to the kitchen to boil water using a kettle.

"Wait, you have an unused coffee brewer?" asked Rika as Mizo nodded. "Yeah. No one uses it though. Coffee grounds are rarely available, and so the powder version is the one most used." explained Mizo as he boiled water and waited as Rika sat down, setting her phone down on the table. "Huh. I.. just.. don't know why you would have one and not use it.. But.. then again, we just do the good 'ol boil water technique.. I never questioned how it could change.." replied Rika as the water boiled and Mizo turned the stove off. 

Mizo grabbed some cups, then the packets, poured a lot into his, then one packet for Rika. Mizo then poured the water on each until full. Mizo then grabbed some normal spoons and grabbed the cups then set them down on the table as he sat down. Then the two started stirring. "Hey, any chance you have milk powder..?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded and pointed to an indescript white cylindrical container. Rika stood up and grabbed it then returned as she used the scoop inside to pour two scoops then closed it.

"Don't you think it's a bit late to drink coffee in the afternoon?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "Meh. You're not my mom. I use it to work." answered Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Heh. Me too.. But, I like hot chocolate more.." responded Rika before the two grabbed their phones and started using it.

_Well.. this is weird.. Why.. isn't Mizo not trying to talk to me?_

_Interesting.. Rika's not trying.. to talk to me?_

Rika peeks out of her phone to see Mizo focused and sighs as she looks back on her phone. But, Mizo wasn't completely unaware, he just knew that Rika was trying to get more out of him, and he understood why, he just didn't want to deal with her. "Fuck this." said Mizo, as he set down his phone and went to the bathroom. Rika looked at the now empty seat and cup with confusion. "Wait.. why'd.. why would he leave.. with that.." Rika cut herself off before she could spiral again.

"It's fine.. I'll.. finish my coffee, clean our cups.. Then.. stay here, and hopefully I'll.. talk to him. Okay.. it's fine." said Rika to herself as she put down her phone and got Mizo's cup. Rika downed her warm coffee in one go, then breathed heavily before heading to Mizo's sink. Rika put down the cups and realized she couldn't do this without listening to music. Rika grabbed her phone then rushed to the sink.

_Now playing: Nevermind Album by Nirvana.._

"Huh.. this is the plates and stuff we used earlier.. Might as well wash them now, while at it." said Rika as she started to wash the dishes. She hummed the tune of that Teen Spirit song while washing, not noticing Mizo's already out of the bathroom and was looking at her. But as Rika felt someone staring at her so she looked around, she saw no one, as Mizo was already out and going back to his room.  "I bet.. that guy's already done.. Hmph. Not even a kiss.. Haha.." said Rika to herself before continuing.

_Mizo's room.._

Mizo sighs as he sits down on his chair. "I've been wasting my life.." said Mizo as he stared at his laptop screen with lines of code. "What am I doing.. It's so pointless. If I can't even.. be there for Rika, why would I invite her home anwyay?! And.. this.. webnovel.. has taken a good part of my life, and for what?! 5:00 sleep, then 12:00 waking time?! I.. shouldn't be this.. disconnected. But.. I am. It.. doesn't matter, right?" ranted Mizo to himself as he looked around.

"Chapter 2.. Season 3.. Spinoffs... Wikis... All for me and her.. Just the two of us.. is that enough? Hehe.. there's something I haven't admitted. I take her experiences as inspiration for some of my writing. That's why she works so well. Haha... When I eventually get around to voicing this.. I just have to be careful to not make her realize. Don't worry, Rika.. I.. won't ever hurt you." promised Mizo to himself as he looked at the small mirror hanging on the top right of his laptop.

"Hey~!" said Rika as she waves at Mizo and flops onto bed again. "I'm done doing the dishes.. You didn't even see if I was..! Heh, it's fine. Just, be grateful, hm?" continued Rika in a playful tone to a forced calm Mizo. "Mhm. I am. Thanks then." said Mizo before turning to start typing again on his laptop. For some reason, Rika felt betrayed by this, as she was expecting something more, but she didn't say anything about it, not yet anyway. "Okay..?" Rika turned to her phone to start doodling.

## Digital Ignorance

### Author's Note:

Huh. Okay, so this is them now. Hopefully Rika knows how to navigate this. Maybe this game that involves coffins and incest will spark something again. They always loved discussing lore right?

"Hey, hey Mizo..!" asked Rika as Mizo side-eyed her. "What.. do you think about the.. **Coffin of Andy and Leyley?**" questioned Rika with an expectant look as Mizo looked at his laptop and sighed. "It's a good game, I guess. Not many would like it. I know a **lot** that doesn't.  Many reasons I couldn't care less to get into." answered Mizo as he continued typing. "Yeah.. It's a controversial game no? Like that **Class of '09** thing.. Have you played it?" asked Rika as Mizo shook his head. "Haven't got the time to. And honestly? I've watched a lot of videos to get the gist.." answered Mizo, as he sipped more coffee.

"You really should.. But, fine. Let's talk about the Coffin first then, since we both played it, correct?" asked Rika as Mizo nodded. "Yes. Go on." Rika clears her throat and starts, "Do you think.. it's.. an 'incest' game?" Mizo smiled slightly as he stopped typing and faced Rika. "What makes you say that?" asked Mizo as Rika is surprised by this sudden move. "W—well.. I—It doesn't come from me, but.. apparently, there's just.. way too much of it in scenes.. And the game is ruined because the author is into it, and.. it's just so.. uh.. disgusting." answered Rika, as Mizo shrugged and looked back at his laptop.

"Babe, what's your opinion though, don't tell me you're accepting the mainstream opinion?" asked Mizo in a sarcastic tone. Rika slightly took longer to process that before blurting out, "H—hey! I'm not! I'm just saying.. What do you think of it? You're a.. writer and all.. I just think you've a lot more to say than I do.." Mizo looked at Rika's eyes. "Well.. it's simple, really." answered Mizo as he drank his coffee.

"Two things, story and publicity. When exploring a taboo topic such as incest, we have to look at where it matters.." said Mizo before looking away and sipping. "Co-dependency. Because of trauma." Mizo looked back at Rika. "The story, as of Decay Part 1 clarifies more on how this explores two siblings, opposite sex.. could gain this unique bond. Mainly, incest is a way to explore how sex is used by the two, against each other. Because of their forced interdependency. As for the internet drama.. let's just say, someone had to.. spice things up to bait. I don't particularly enjoy it, but.. it's not an inexcusable thing." explained Mizo, as Rika paid close attention.

"There, now. Go, and form your opinion based on your boyfriend." continued Mizo before chuckling and returning to typing on his laptop. Rika was about to retort, but she sighs instead, her blush finally showing. "I.. just think you know.. what would've.. caused someone to write about stuff like that? You know.. why?" asked Rika as Mizo sipped on his coffee. "A lot of things. We'll never know since the author got doxxed, but.. as a writer.. I say the reason is to tell a compelling complex story that makes people think. More so than usual mainstream stories. But.." Mizo shrugged. "That's mine. Not hers. We'll never know."

Rika goes silent as she lays down on the bed. "I just think.. it's a bit weird.. to have.. so many.. dislike.. _it._ Like.." Rika is desperately trying to find the words to describe her current feelings. "W—what I mean.. is.. there's always something to dislike.. but.. I don't know why I'm so affected by it, y'know? Like.. controversial stuff, opinions.. I just.. can't.. think of any comments that would provide the nuance and like.. complexity.. of topics.. like _that.._ I don't know. Maybe I just need to develop self-confidence, but I can't help feel.. bad for liking certain stuff that's controversial." explained Rika, as she looked at Mizo, unreadable.

"Ah.. so my little princess here is feeling bad for being controversial, huh?" asked Mizo, as Rika was a bit taken back by the teasing, but nodded. "Yeah? That's just life. I know that feeling. But, when you have a story you want to tell.. and topics to explore. It simply comes down to _mindful exploration._" answered Mizo, as he stopped for a minute to look at Rika, who was confused on why he stopped. "Finding.. **inspiration** is so simple on the internet nowadays. Don't worry, under the iceberg.. You'll find what **you** want." continued Mizo, as Rika and Mizo stared at each other, before Mizo looked at his laptop and continued typing.

"Ugh. Maybe I'm just lazy.. I can't.. I don't have the energy to search and search.. especially when.. you can't find the content you want. And **fuck me** if I have to do it myself.." replied Rika as she looked at her phone. "Shouldn't we walk around outside or something? It's summer, why are we switching between your house and my house weekly..?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "You're tired. I'm tired. We never do it except when your parents drag us to church."

"Mizo.. Do you think.. the future is happier? More fulfilling?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged again. "Don't know. Honestly, worrying about it is as pointless as me writing this story. It's just to preoccupy yourself from endless boredom and freedom not used." answered Mizo, as Rika raised one of her eyebrows. "Your story..? Pointless?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded. "Didn't I tell you? I'm getting a Computer Science degree, so all of this is useless." Rika brushed her hair as she responded, "If you're so good at that, why don't you take an English degree or something?"

"Because." said Mizo, as he looked at Rika quite irritated, which made Rika slightly twitch for some reason. Mizo sighs as he looks away. "It's not.. profitable. I know and want to code. But.. this..? The only thing this helps me do is—" Mizo cut himself off. "Nevermind. It's just that. It's not a good job to have."  Mizo looked at his computer and continued typing. Rika looked at Mizo for a while, sighed and flopped on the bed again.

## Audiovisual Waves

### Author's Note:

Less.. uh.. serious. What I mean is, unlike the first two, it's still part of the story but it has less.. what do you call it.. 'adult angst', because this is what those like.. first chapter rants that in the grand story, don't really expand much. But, anyways, I hope you enjoy it anyway~!

"So.. that's it, thanks for watching, g'bye! Peace!" said Mizo to his microphone as he ended his Wavey gameplay recording. "Ugh.. Finally. So I can play Nirvana.." said Rika, as she immediately started playing 'Blandest'.

_Now playing—_

"Hey! Can't you just use earbuds or headphones or something..? You can use mine." said Mizo, as Rika stopped playing and looked at him, unamused. "Ugh, I don't need it! I just.. don't want to use.. I... fuck wait..!" said Rika, as she was searching in her backpack, and found no earbud case. "Wait no no.. fuck..! I left jt at home.. It was charged too.." ranted Rika, as Mizo chuckled but gestured to his headphones as an offer.

"H—hey! Not the **bloody** point!" said Rika, as she pouted. "What's so important.. about it anyway? I'm just playing music we both like?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "I don't know, really. I.. uh.. just want some silence when writing." answered Mizo, before Rika groaned and stretched her arms. "It's so.. eerily quiet though.. but.. ugh. I can't focus while.. **fine.** **Dammit**, I'll take your headphones." said Rika before getting the headphones in a forceful way.

She starts listening to the music while drawing, some scene in some anime game, the 'aura farming' of a certain witch-like erudite. Meanwhile Mizo enjoyed his quiet.. introspection, but after a while, even he couldn't stand the silence. As much as he wanted to have anything playing, he just.. couldn't write the script for that Wavey Waves review without something keeping his mind focused. Yet, he felt that listening to music would pull him away from writing, so it was something he thought about as the document stalled.

Mizo looks at Rika again, chilling and drawing, the headphones clearly worn. He looks away, as he muttered to himself, "For such a guy like me, is it that hard to ask the already chill artist to make the thumbnail..? Her laptop is right there, and her drawing tablet.. hm." Mizo looked upwards, as he slumped on his chair. "Nevermind. I'm not done with the script anyway. Ugh." said Mizo, as he looked at his script again, then looked to his calendar, containing the summer activities he's planning.

May 09 — Deadline of Chapter 3 || May 16 — Finish H:Railway and WavWa Review

"It gotta be done next week or.. right. That chapter." commented Mizo, as he looked at Rika, somewhat guilty as she was adjusting her position on the bed she is using as her workstation. "Hmm.. 'I hate them but I need them.' huh?" repeated Mizo to himself, as he recalled Rika's words. "So focused." continued Mizo, before looking back at his laptop. "Honestly. You're like glass. Fragile, easy to break, yet something I look at and protect. Glass is made when heated to extreme temperatures, just like how you're here because of everything. School to Family, your struggles never do end, huh?" asked Mizo to himself, seemingly trying to reflect on the girl unaware of his musings.

Mizo reflects on the coldness of the air-con and the hotness of the sun. "Waves form due to how sound travels, yeah?" Mizo continues to write. "You know how sometimes, in an ARG, something incomprehensible can make sense once you look through it using a spectrograph? Well.. I guess what it can mean is.. how a person acts and speaks looks normal on the outside, but when you look from a different perspective, and with the right.. 'methods' or 'tools' you easily see the fragileness of the whole thing. How.. quaint." continued Mizo, in this monologue while typing a fantasy villain analysing humanity in a detached way. "Fascinating, isn't it? How easily one person could trap you in a bond you both enjoy and hate, co-dependency and contradictions.." Mizo then writes the villain to kiss the hero, as he laughs away the bound heroine.  

Mizo sighs as he moves his head a bit before writing more background and motivations in his magic fantasy world, before calling it a day, and checking off Chapter 3 as done. Coincidentally, he manages to close it as Rika started to talk, "Hey.. Mizo, I'm hungry.. les' go cook something.." Mizo nodded, "Of course. We have kalabasa in the fridge from my parents. Now, as the wo—" Rika interrupted, "Shut up! I know what you're about to say. You don't have to guilt me, dammit. Just help me when needed. My mom's not *that bad...* I was still forced to learn how to cook, come on. Before I poison your portion." Mizo chuckled as he fully closed his laptop then left with Rika.

## Sleep Pressures

### Author's Note:

A.. something involving that issue buried underneath all the interpersonal drama between her own classmates, Rika isn't just dealing with Mizo, but her own family issues as well, and other related topics. Funnily enough, it involves something Rika should crave to escape her troubled life, sleep.

And of course, this is a story involving more.. intense emotions, as even in non-school life, she is brought to reality to face the true problems that influence her life.

"Hey.. Mizo.." said Rika, as she arrived back from her house, as she usually went back to her parents' house for sunday to restock and 'talk' to her parents about the week. She was wearing casual clothing, Nirvana band tee, and a filled huge pink backpack. "Oh? You're here~ Come on, let's go in.." said Mizo, with a smile, as Rika entered. As they walked to Mizo's room, Mizo started talking, "So how'd the family meetup go?" Rika didn't respond, as she always does, yet she doesn't know why Mizo keeps bringing it up.

"Alright.. Then, nothing interesting. Then come on, hey wait—" said Mizo, as she held her from her waist as she realized she was about to hit a  wall. "Where are you going.. Oh, you must've not gotten a lot of sleep, huh? You look.. tired." asked Mizo, now fully focusing on a very tired Rika. "Oh.. yeah... It's nothing.. It's just.. how things go at the family." said Rika, before she forced his hand to move with her to his room.

Then they arrived and entered, as both pulled back. "Woah, no need to be so.. forceful, we were.. nevermind. I forgot some snacks, I'll be right back!" said Mizo, before leaving quickly as Rika noticed the air conditioning running. "Must've been lucky to have that kind. Especially in this.. hot.. afternoon.." trailed off Rika as she sat then laid on Mizo's bed as her bag slid off to the floor, forgotten.

Many swirling thoughts circled in her head, but a few things cried out, like disappointing dread. For some reason, those damn stupid thoughts about what her parents thought parasitically feed off her usual insecurities. Then, _their_ words start forming;

~~You're always on that damn phone! | We should go out sometime, as a family.. | You dissapoint us by going to that boy, but we'll let you, if you wish. | Your sleep is broken, and you haven't changed since that breakdown at the start of that semester.. | Why do you keep doing this yourself? | You're such a disappointing leech, that is wasting her time on that laptop we bought for you. | Look at that, you're fat, you should exercise more with that boy.~~

"Rika? You okay? You're crying.." said Mizo, as she noticed he was wiping away her apparent tears as she came back to processing the surroundings around her. "I'm just tired.. Mizo.. I'm tired of my life.. and _them._" said Rika, as she closed her eyes, feeling that drift once more. "You.. wanna..?" asked Mizo, before Rika shook her head pleadingly. "No. I.. just want you beside me.. right now.. even just.. for a while.." said Rika, as Mizo sighed and said, "Okay." before laying beside her.

"It's fine. I'll just think of it as a good nap. Come on, go sleep, love~" whispered Mizo to Caj as it looks like Rika starts to fall asleep. "Looks like this deadline will have to move.. Oh well. I guess it can't be helped." mumbled Mizo as he typed on his phone before putting it down and sleeping, tying up and problems he might've been brewing inside his head for later reflection.

## Even in Her Youth

### Author's Note:

"She was nothing, kept her body clean, was (going) nowhere, a disgrace to the family name, and that ain't worth a shame!"

An interpretation and modification of a certain *Nirvana* song, used for Rika's own self-reflection. Anyway, she is totally going to be sad again, or not? Who knows at this point, their relationship tumbles in and out of despair like a roller coaster that moves very fast and wild.

Anyways, after this, it should be a chill chapter, I think.

Freedom Park - This.. uh, is an actual generic term for a park made by the local city to let the people have political gatherings/do anything freely in a public place. Yes. This exists.

— jmb~ | June 02, 2025 | 01:41

"Hey.. Mizo?" said Rika to Mizo, as they sat on the benches in the local freedom park. "Hm?" Mizo looked up from his phone to see a pondering Rika. "I wonder what.. it would feel to.. move away from this place." admitted Rika, as Mizo put his phone down, sighed and looked at the huge old trees in the park. "Probably.. lonelier?" said Mizo, as Rika unintentionally moved closer. "Uh.. yeah..? But.. you know, it'd be.. well, if things go our way at least, freeing to.. just be with you." continued Rika, as Mizo turned and looked at her wandering eyes and face. "Hm..? Do you.. not have anything you miss around here? Like, your house.. the childhood memories formed.. et cetera?" asked Mizo, as Rika shrugs.

"I dunno. Maybe? But like.." Rika thinks to her past, looking down and looking around. Rika stays silent as Mizo sighs and waits for Rika to make up an answer.  "I guess.. a lot. But.. I don't remember them." Rika reflected more, as she sighed. "It's just.." Rika thinks to what will come. "Do you know the feeling of.. losing yourself? And that.. once you.. you realize that small sliver of hope slips away from your hands again and again.. everything only hurts..?" asked Rika, as she grabbed her hair, which was dyed white during the start of their vacation.

"I.. I was just asked to.. undye my hair. You know, for school? I didn't feel.. good about it, at all. People only expected black hair, and so.. any color that isn't.. 'normal' is.. wasted. W—what about you, I.. noticed your hair is.. long?" Rika asks Mizo, as he nodded. "Yeah, I'll go to the barber soon.. It's.. genuinely infuriating, you know? Ugh, hey, once we're outta here, we can do it again!" said Mizo, as Rika nodded silently.

"Y—years.. from now? Even just waiting for the next vacation feels.. longer than what I want it to be. Remain.. like this, even towards.. just because.." Rika stopped herself as her last words trembled. "Yeah it sucks. That's just public school for ya. I mean, I'm used to it. I just didn't bother to go to the barber when dadi stopped doing it in the summers after.. uh.. grade 8?" Mizo responded as he stopped when he noticed Rika was looking down, sniffling.

"Oh..? Rika..?" asked Mizo, as Rika replied. "I—I'm sorry, I just.. I was.. y—yeah.. haha.." Rika was hiding her pain again, at this point, Mizo felt like it'd be better to silently acknowledge it. "Aha. Yeah, so.. um.. oh yeah, what about the band that we started?" asked Mizo, as Rika held the neckline of her shirt nervously. "O—oh.. Yeah. I.. can we.. do that? Like.. the covers and stuff? Are you done with your.. novel and stuff?" asked Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Mostly..! Just gotta get Season 2 done, hehe~! But I promise, once that's done, we can.. start."

Rika nodded as she looked off to the distance again, the cold cloudy atmosphere spelling of the rainy season inherent in the beginning of school. "Start..? Ugh.." Rika contemplated it before answering, "Sure.. I.. love to." Rika clutched her head as she pondered more. "Man, hehe.. sure is tough.. haha..?" said Mizo to break the silence. "Talking about life.. yeah? If it was easy, we wouldn't.. be sitting down, tch." Rika sighed as she stood up. "I can't sit here like this. I'm getting too nervous.." Rika looked at Mizo as he also stood up. "Mmm? A walk? Alright. But just so you know, I'm faster." said Mizo, as Rika scoffed. "Hey, we're not competing idiot. Ugh, and you're a man, alright?" Rika smirks. "Playing with a biological advantage is cruel for a dainty girl myself~!" Mizo grabs Rika's hand as he started running. "Hey!! Our bags!" Rika protested slightly, as Mizo ran back, grabbed their bags and ran again, making a speechless Rika accept the current situation.

## Come Back A Slave

### Author's Note:

Well, summer's ending, better get your relationship sorted out before it affects you during another stressful school year. At least, that was both thought as they each separately thought of going out to the mall, and ended up asking each other.. Mizo was first and Rika would forever regret that, as they move to hopefully resolve the mess they've made existing together.

Anyway yeah, another **Nirvana** lyric, just a closing chapter to solve the angst to make sure the fluff after makes sense. Anywho, what do y'all think? Of the two? Are the two bound to go down in pain and guilt or heal and stay together? Do they deserve each other as weird people or should they stay as weirdly romantic best friends? Not even that, maybe full on separation? Anyways, just be cool about it.

Honestly, I don't know how to end this, so.. if you think this is shorter and doesn't solve anything, yeah. It doesn't, unfortunately, I don't have time to finish.. Oh well, see you in the next chapter!

— jmb~ | June 13, 2025 | 15:01

Rika sat down as she looked around the after-rain atmosphere on the top floor of a large city mall, she and Mizo were at, he was at the CR. "I.. it's almost.. June 16." Rika looks at her yellow ring with the purple heart on it. "Everything.. feels so.. empty. Now, huh?" wondered Rika to herself as she looked at the ring on left arm, ring finger. "I guess.. I.. have been getting less and less.. aware of my own.. everything." Rika looks up to the still-cloudy skies.

_Mizo was out of the bathroom.._

"I'm just.. tired of crying or.. feeling bad, or even.. empty like this. I always need.. _him_ or.. _something_ to cope." Rika sighs. "I mean.. I guess, I haven't.. talked properly anyway." Rika shrugs. "Haha.. ugh.. Mizo..." Rika further reflected. "Man, our life sure is.. empty, huh Mizo?" Mizo appeared behind her, as she immediately felt his presence. "Yeah, guess so, huh?" Mizo says, low just so only Rika can hear.

"Mhmm.. You're done?" asked Rika, as Mizo whispered, "Yeah.. and we should continue~" Rika went silent as she tried to look at him directly but he suddenly stopped her. "Ah? What..? Mizo.. this place isn't for.. uh.. any.. ahem." Rika is more firm on Mizo's hands as Mizo pulls away, and Rika finally turns to Mizo. 

"What was that..?" asked Rika as Mizo shrugged. "Don't know, just.. wanted to stay in that position... sorry." Mizo says, as Rika sighed. "Uhuh. You're not slick Mizo, I know what I felt. Y'know what, whatever. Let's.. not fight here." Rika grabs her bag. "I.. just, need some time off of the problems, okay?" Rika says, as the two silently moved on.

## About A Girl

### Author's Note:

What's this? **_NIRVANA REFERENCE?!_** I'm so shocked. Anyway, yes. This time, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's a chill chapter. That's it. More fluff and romance for the two co-dependent couple! (Not backfiring, totally)

Rika was wondering when it happened but when she woke up one day, Mizo was suddenly more energetic than he has been this entire summer. Rika knows she has problems, but she decides to embrace whatever happened here.

— jmb~ | June 03, 2025 | 22:18

---

Rika was sleeping on Mizo's bed, when she woke up to Mizo using his acoustic guitar, learning the chords to 'Where Did You Sleep Last Night' its Nirvana rendition. "Mizo..?" mumbled Rika, as she groggily woke up, feeling tired, yet confused about the loud music playing. "Mizo.. don't rehearse while I'm fuckin' sleeping..!" said Rika irritated as Mizo stopped for a moment as he put the guitar down. "Woops. You're alive?" asked Mizo, as Rika shouted. "Of course I— huh?!" Rika is very confused as Mizo chuckled. "Dummy.. I thought you were knocked out, you didn't wake up when I played.. uh.. a lot of songs, this is like my twelve out of fifteen.." said Mizo, as Rika jumped out. "Huh?!" Rika looked around her, it's the middle of the afternoon. "T—the.." Mizo nodded as Rika ran to the bathroom. 

_Later.._

"So.. um.. do you know how to play the drums anyway?" asked Rika, as Mizo shifted his head left-to-right in a 'maybe but not really' way. "What? That's literally your job. Like, that's half of the song!" exclaimed Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "I mean.. if I did practice, you wouldn't be able to sleep." commented Mizo, as Rika tilted her head in confusion. "Don't you have a sound proof room or something? Besides, I.. uh.. don't.." Rika cleared her throat. "I don't need sleep! I am perfectly fine." Mizo smirked. "You were?? Man, I thought I was hallucinating what I heard last night." Rika tried to remember but everything's hazy. "Huh? Tell me. I don't.. remember.. hm."

_Flashback~_

"Mizo..!" said Rika as Mizo was working on his laptop. "Mmm? What is it, babe?" asked Mizo, as Rika hugged Mizo while he was facing his laptop, sitting down, so it was to his back. "Hm? Rika..? Something wrong? You usually don't.. well.. initiate yourself?" asked Mizo as he closed his laptop temporarily. "Mmmnn.. yeah.. It's my damn parents! They have to give a damn about my life.. my stupid calendar.. my.. you.. my time schedule.. they act like I have to share everything just because they feed me when I was in highschool.." Rika complained, her voice slurring as Mizo was a bit confused as to why she sounds drunk, even though he knows he doesn't have any liquor at home. "Stupid parents.. wish.. I can move away or something... no wonder my brother left.. for college.." rambled Rika, as Mizo stood up as Rika pulled back.

Mizo looked closer into Rika's eyes, glazed over. "Mizo..? Why'd you stand up.." Rika questions, before Mizo dragged her to bed. "You need sleep, girl. You look like you're barely conscious. What did you do last night?" asked Mizo as Rika chuckled. "I was... looking and drawing sooo.. many yuri wouldn't believe it! I remember one where the girl was—" rambled Rika, as Mizo cut her off when he threw a pillow to her head. "Hey.. did you seriously just spend— where did you even sleep last night? I last saw you on the couch, mumbling to yourself, why did you come here?" asked Mizo as Rika hugged him again. "Ahh.. I just wanted to.. feel you.. y'know? Your smell.. your.. muscles.." Rika mumbled, as Mizo chuckled, thinking to himself she's definitely regretting this in the morning. "Mhm? Really? I like you too. Though, memorizing my.. smell is a bit weird?" Mizo responds, as Rika slumped over on his body. 

"Yeah.. yeah.. Is.. all the same! Fancy-schmazy pants..." rambled Rika, as Mizo looked at her as she smiled. "Hmm..? Why you lookin' at me like that..?" Rika questioned, before Mizo kissed her. Rika immediately reciprocated as Mizo pushed Rika to the bed. "Mmm..? Ah..? Mizo.. this is.. weird.." asked Rika as Mizo was on top of her. "I.. I'm not doing.. I just.. do you..?" asked Mizo, as Rika as mumbled something uncertain. "Ah. I'm pulling back, then." said Mizo as he pulled back as Rika weakly flopped her arms on her sides. "Mizo.. one more..." said Rika, as Mizo looked at her, amused. "Hah. One more? Aight." replied Mizo as he kissed Rika on the lips again, as Rika pulled him in close again before he pulled back. "Thanks.. love..." drifted off Rika, as Mizo wondered if Rika is going to remember this moment.

_Snap back to reality._

Rika was blushing. Super very red. "I—I.. d—did I.. really..?" asked Rika as Mizo shrugged. "Well.. you're the one that.. well came in here so.." Mizo commented, as Rika looked away. "I.. uh. let's not speak of this, hm?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded. "Sure. But like.. you don't have to be embarrassed? It's what couples do." said Mizo, as Rika squeaked. "I..! Um.. yeah.. Hehe.. Don't— Don't.. elaborate.. please..? I—It's a moment of weakness.. A—anyways uh.. you didn't.. um.. comment on my.. parents! Yeah?" asked Rika, as Mizo shrugged. "Well, I suppose your parents.. are overbearing? I mean, if you were secretive about us for a while, I'd assume they want to know about you because you're their daughter, right?" exclaimed Mizo, as hesitantly nodded in agreement. "Yeah.. I just.. don't want them to.. know. Just.. I don't.. I don't know why. I trust you more than them." admitted Rika, as Mizo nodded.

"Well? Want to rehearse?" questioned Mizo, as Rika nodded. "Haha.. Okay!! Let's go. I am NOT letting you get that one over me..! I swear. Let's go and.. jam or make music!!" answered Rika, as Mizo smiled. "Then kiss me properly this time? No sleep-deprived rants?" commented Mizo as Rika kissed Mizo quickly in the lips before pulling back. "There! You.. you're begging me almost. It's kinda pathetic~!" Rika is smug and pouting as Mizo shrugs again. "Alriight.. Fiine.. You got me.. Hey, I wouldn't be so fallen if you weren't gor—" commented Mizo before Rika grabbed him. "Shut! Shut! Let's move already, oh and take your acoustic too." Mizo tugged on Rika's hold as she groans and lets him move and properly close his laptop as he grabs his guitar. "Aight, just don't blow your voice out, we don't want you to sound like a one hundred year smoker." said Mizo, as Rika replied, "Hey! I practice all the time! In.. the.. shower.. or alone.. whatever! We'll figure it out!" before they walked to where their electric guitars and drums are stored, in Mizo's extra repurposed sound-proof room.

## Set the Record

### Author's Note: 

Well, back to school! I sure do hope the two are fine now...??

(Nah.)

Edit: Starting point, ease something, also a bit rushed, but who cares, this whole series is a rushed job

— jmb~ | June 23, 2025 | 0:09

"Rika..!" Mizo sits down as Rika is slumped down on the table of the school cafeteria. "Hi..." Rika says as she gazes up. "So.." Mizo smiles. "How's first day??" Rika sighs. "You mean.. fourth day?" Mizo tilts his head. "But it's.. Friday, the.. oh." Rika nods. "Yeah." Mizo nodded too. "Alright.. Then, so.. just in general, first week?" Rika shrugs.

"It's fine... I guess." Rika looks at Mizo. "Fine..? Hah, well mine was.. interesting to say the least. A lotta new people, some random shenanigans, especially with our teacher being the yap goddess~!" Rika nods. "Haha.. Ma'am Tem?" Mizo nodded excitedly. "Yeah! Yeah, our adviser, yes?" Mizo looked away, adjusting his glasses. "Honestly, it's been a blast, so my surprise, when resectioning happens!"

Mizo looks at Rika. "Me and Kari were hanging out when _that_ message popped up. You know, you got it too!" Rika nods. "Mhm.. I heard it was.. chaotic, especially during.. our.. hm. Science Period." Mizo chuckled. "Haha, yeah.. It was.. eventful, like we were panicking in where to go, and.. well.." Mizo trailed off as Rika sighed and spoke up, "Yeah.. The course right? Of course I picked what I think you want.." Mizo looked down. "Comp. Sci and Creative Writing?"

Rika was silent before answering, "Yes." The two went silent as Rika sighed to break the silence between them. "I'll.. set the record here, Mizo." Rika gets something out of her shoulder bag, and got a pin Mizo got when they were out and in a local super mall, a certain camellia bloom of a character from Wavey Waves. Then she lays it down on the table. "I don't know where to go, and I don't want to know where I'd want to, if it's not with you." 

Rika chuckles darkly. "I know, I seem jealous, like.. I can't let you have Kari or something, but.. you two have been always closer in normal, platonic things..!! I've just.. been either your burden or your clingy high school GF that'll never leave you alone.." Rika sighs. "Just.. I don't want to hear about it. I don't know what to do in my section.. and.. I would rather just.. hear a life through you." Rika says before finally looking down, heavily breathing then looking at Mizo again, then smiling. "What else?"

"Else.." Mizo is looking down, trying to keep a smile but faltering due to what Rika just said. "Haha.. Well, there's still.. oh yeah! The pictorial, I.D. thing, how'd ya do?" asked Mizo as Rika chuckled and looked at Mizo, half-alive. "Styled my hair.. It was.. amusing to see that I had such an embarassing photo for my previous one." Rika flicked her hair to show it off. "See? Even without.. _ahem._ **much** makeup, I look gorgeous. I looked one like one too. Ah, such a shame that only other girls noticed, if only.." Rika looked at Mizo, before she looked away, smiling.

"Hair styling, the slight foundation, and some eyeliner.." Rika smugly smiles at Mizo. "How about you, huh, Mizo?" Rika looks at Mizo, before Mijo faintly smiled. "Nahh.. You know me, even if there were an opportunity to retake I wouldn't take it!" Rika chuckled. "Serves you right, dummie~" Rika looks away. "So.. if.. things were to.. you know, do you think..?" Rika asks, a bit hesitant.

"We'll see, babe." said Mizo as Rika blushed but she hid her face. "Ugh.. yeah yeah.. I.. kinda have to draw so.. like, unless you have plans or something??" Rika mumbled underneath her face planted firmly to the table, which her hands were covering. "Hmmm.. would you be interested... after the flag retreat, I got some.. connections to.. speak to." Mizo says, as Rika looked up in immediate confusion. "Since when did you have— huh?! What for??" Mizo winks. "This is a tool that will help us later, as it's called foresha—" Mizo dodged a slap from Rika.

"_Go!"_ Rika shouted as Mizo chuckled and shrugged before winking then leaving. "Damn you and your.. your.. ugh, damn you Mizo." muttered Rika to herself.

## To the Top

### Author's Note:

In this story, it seemed turmoil would take hold, but now? Things have yet again been changed, and now again, may the two meet again in higher floors.

— jmb~ | June 26, 2025 | 17:00

"Again, this is part of the _new_ changes to the _new_ curriculum. This is most likely going to be the last ones, but then again, orders from higher-up, I'm your principal, not DepEd executive. On each door, as of right now, there should be names of people in those sections. All of your batch's floor." the principal announced before the entire class batch started heading to the higher floors.

"Oh boy.." Mizo thought to himself as he walked upstairs, with the crowd of students all also going. "I wonder.. if I'm still in the third floor, hope to god.." Mizo is still climbing upstairs. "Yeah.. this takes like.. hours sometimes." Mizo thinks as he finally gets to the third floor and grabs his things. "Alright.. Let's see here.." Mizo looks at the door of his section. "Nope.. no.. no.. okay. Whatever then.." Mizo goes to the next door, the other room in the third floor. "No..??" Mizo says, as he looks around. "Noo.. Fourth floor??"

"I also didn't see Rika, or Kari.. that could mean.." said Mizo as he climbed up what would be the third set of stairs he had to climb to get to.. the fourth floor. "Hmm.." Mizo sees the first room, it's the class where all the supposed business majors go. "Not mine, also not here.." Mizo finally, agonizingly arrives at the last room of his batchmates. "Crusi, Rika..!! Then, Crusela, Kari!!! Ohh, there's also, Ibasa, Mizo.." Mizo does a double-take. "There's.. yeah, there it is." Mizo immediately goes into class.

"Oh look, your boyfriend's here~!" Kari says, as she 'forced' Rika to look at Mizo, coming in. "O—oh..!!! Yeahhh!!!" Rika is excited, and was even trying to contain it, but yeah then she got up and hugged Mizo tightly, whom was still carrying his bags. "Woah woah.. Settle down, Rika." Rika kissed Mizo quickly before moving back. "Okay.. So!! Where are you—" Rika was cut off when Mizo moved to a lone armchair at the very back, near Kari and Rika's seats at it's left.

"Okay?? Heyy I'm just going to—" Rika grabs her bags before Kari made her drop them. "Hey hey, Rika, there's like.. a bunch more hours where you can hangout with him, okay? Besides, it's way more likely if we're grouped." Rika groans but she noddded. "Fiiine.. You can.. live." Rika is slightly smirking as she looked away, slightly blushing before the teacher came in and she switched mood.

## Loving You Makes Me Sick

_A dance of chaos..._

_Now, playing Aneurysm - Nirvana_

"Man he does use a lot of heroin.. huh?" said Rika to herself as she chills on a quiet school afternoon. The lull between when her dismissal and the other lower grade levels' own. "I mean, you can barely use marijuana here in the great country of the Philippines, so like.. the whole rock-'n'-roll lifestyle I can't even replicate, though, I don't want to." said Rika as Mizo arrived. "Oh, you're here." Mizo sits down. "Yeah? What about it?" Rika asks, as Mizo smiles.

"It's weird. Usually, you'd be home or have already found me. This time, I found you." observed Mizo, as Rika looked away blushing slightly. "W—what? I swear, there is no correlation. I.. just so happen to be around where'd you'd be! Nothing more! Like right now, actually—" Rika's explanation was cut off when Mizo moved into kissing range, as she was looking at him, her mouth slightly agape.

"Noted." Mizo pulls back. Rika slumped on the cafeteria table as she felt that damn persistent dull ache in her abdomen. "It's just.. yeah.." Rika goes quiet for a while, trying to go through the pain but after a while she sighs and goes and gets some granola bar she yoinked from her pantry. "Hah." Mizo looked at her, as Rika tried to focus on the bar but she was wondering why Mizo was still _this_ smug.

Rika scowled. "What the _fuck_ are you looking at me for?!" Mizo chuckled as he pulled back and put his hands up. "Fine fine.." Mizo looks at Rika lazily. "You're not in the mood?" asked Mizo as Rika blushed but nodded anyway. "W—well— you're there looking at me like I've like.. like— ummm.. I don't know?! Just.. look at your phone or something." Rika blabbers as Mizo shrugged. "Gets." 

Mizo brought out his lunch of dry rice and meat. "Lucky.." Rika grumbled as she clearly saw Mizo smirk before going back to neutral as he goes and eats his packed lunch. As Rika looked, at least to Mizo, pitiful, he decided to speak up. "Aww.. poor little Rika..? What? Is that granola bar seriously your only snack?" asked Mizo, as Rika sighed and nodded sadly. "I already ate it all..." Rika said in a slight sad yet exaggerated tone.

"Don't you have mo—" Mizo asks before Rika answers. "I do! I.. uh.." Rika looks away. "I'm trying to save, and uh.. I won't have enough to go home if I buy food." Mizo speaks up. "Why? Can't you just like.. walk ho— Ohh right~ You live like.. one more kilometer away so you can't— hah!" Rika becomes irritated as he looks back at Mizo. "A—and so what?! You come home disgusting and sweaty? At least I'm home, and don't have to smell bad the whole time I'm walking one centimeter per second to my house!" 

"Ooh~ Burn. But counterpoint: I have food, you don't." Mizo says, smiling as Rika tried to counter but her period cramp came back so she gritted her teeth and held her lower abdomen. "I win, hehe." Mizo says, but he's clearly sarcastic as Rika realizes that his face is more gentle and stupidly affectionate. "Shut up.." Rika sighs again. "Can you _libre_ me?" asked Rika as Mizo nodded. "Hah, sure, what?" asked Mizo as he got his wallet. "Relieved — that iced tea thing, honey one.."

"Sure." Mizo got up and just bought two for both of them as Rika watched him do so. "I'm just.." Rika takes one piece of meat and eats it as she quickly washes her hands of rubbing alcohol before he arrives back. "Here, _babe._" Mizo greets as Rika swallows her complaint so he won't bother her as she takes it. "_Thanks._" said Rika in a strained way as she drank the drink like she was a thirsty gal in a desert.

Mizo was going to comment but instead he simply smiled as he continued eating his lunch. The two were silently hanging out until Mizo finally finished his lunch. "Well, that was eventful." Mizo comments as Rika groans. "I—I'm going home." Rika says, before Mizo grins."What because I am?" asked Mizo as Rika sighed and hesitantly nodded. "Dummy, we just happen to have the same schedules, okay? Now unless I'm walking to the mall alone, let's go.." Rika says as Mizo widened his eyes. "Alright, I get your game, princess." Mizo stands up.

"Y'know, Mizo.." Rika says as she gets her stuff. "This whole.. uh.. thing," Rika looks away. "—it really does make me _sick_ sometimes." Rika side-eyes Mizo, closely looking at his reaction. "Don't take it... like I have a problem with it, I.." Rika smiles. "..just have a skill issue at love, and.." Rika grabs her bag and starts to leave. "I hope you do understand me, beyond just.. these." Rika then starts to walk as Mizo hums in acknowledgement before catching up with her.

## Beyond Us

### Author's Note:

I had a hard time writing these cycles of separation. Like, as the title says, 'Beyond Us' what does that mean?? Beyond their relationship? I guess. Anyways, no fluff here, only angst!! 

I can't let them always be happy, y'know, because I'm not! Also because I'm going to run out of fluff to write, if I don't do this, so.. have fun?

"New sitting positions!" Their teacher said, as half of the class audibly groaned while half was already negotiating. "Alphabetical!" said the teacher, as once again, the duo are bound to separate by fate. 

_Later.._

Mizo sighed as he was _'forced'_ to sit between two other random boys. Rika and Kari on the other hand were pretty much inseparable in this arrangement, as they are directly next to each other. Rika already looked concerned, but didn't want to reveal more than what she already did for the past few days about her and Mizo. Mizo thinks, "My.. Rika, she's.. out of my reach again."

_Rika POV._

"Girl, you look down..?" asked Kari as Rika sighed and looked down. She _really_ wanted to look at Mizo, but the whole mood brought her down. "You know why." Rika says as she goes and gets her phone. "Oh.." Kari looked at the teacher, then the boys were doing whatever. Mizo noticeably as far away as he can be without being too far to go back if _'requested'._ Kari nodded, understanding Rika's downer attitude.

"The adviser said that it's technically 'temporary' like for real, that the other teachers requested." Kari explained, as Rika nodded. "Yes, I heard her. I know." Rika was about to continue but stopped herself. "I.. get it, uh wanna talk about something else?" asked Kari, as Rika just slumped over with no response, but that was a clear surrender to Kari as she sighed and went on her phone.

_Much later.. During 'The Break'._

Rika and Kari stood up to leave, but then as soon as they were about to exit the door. "Rika." Rika stops. Kari responds, "I—It's fine, I can go~! Uh, Rika.. want me to..?" Rika answered, "It's fine. Go. I don't have anything to order." Kari was about to say something, but felt it wasn't the right time and nodded, before scurrying off.

"So—" Mizo says, before Rika cuts him off. "Look.. I.. don't, wanna talk about it." Rika sighs. "It sucks.." Rika held Mizo's shirt and tugged it. "It _fucking sucks..._" Rika's voice cracked slightly. "I.. just want to.. ignore whatever happened." Rika hesitates, before hugging Mizo. "I'm sorry, I can't be mature, or.. I'm just.. too emotional, right now..."

**_"We.. just.. need to separate for a while."_**

Rika's voice fully cracked as she sobbed onto his shirt before repressing it and pulling back. Rika wanted to say something, but she sighs before leaving Mizo there.

**_"I guess this is just how.. we work."_**

Mizo leaves.

## The Bi Awakening

### Author's Note:

Fluff! This time focusing on something we threaded in the past. Yes, this confirms the sexualities. As for Mizo? I'll let the story speak for itself. Because, it's way more entertaining to write a story about it than a note. Anyways, enjoy!

_During a much more.. early time of life for the 
two.._

Rika is eating her lunch as she looks at that stupidly interesting boy chilling in the railing she was supposed to be at. "Ugh, stupid stupid.. Why didn't I just push him off??" grumbled Rika as she continued eating. "But.. ugh.." Rika sighs as she looks at other girls, her heart racing whenever she finds herself staring for more than a second. Then, to Mizo. For whatever dumb reason, her heart was beating more for this rude smug boy, casually irritating poor Rika. "You're such a.." 

_"..dream?"_

"No—! A bitch. Yeah, pussy ahh.." Rika chuckled at herself, imagining what it'd be like to get Mizo embarrassed and leave the spot to her.

_Later.._

"Hey!! Get out of my—" Rika stops herself. "Hey!" Mizo was ignoring her. "You stupid dummy. That's _my spot._ I'll push you off this time!!" Mizo finally looks at her, and smirks. "Sure? Push me off. I'll push you instead. **Haha, don't test me.**" Rika was briefly considering it, but she was actually wondering how strong the motherfucker is. "Fine!" Rika tries pushing him but her balance is a bit off as Mizo manages to push her to the ground, before she fell and died though, Mizo catched her on her back.

"AHH!?" Rika looks around nervously as she realizes Mizo's and her face were very close and this _bitch_ was holding her like she was his— "Hey! Hey..!!" Rika quickly got up straight as Mizo brushed off his polo. "You're welcome, Rika." Rika faintly blushed, as she was mad about whatever happened. "Fuck— You!! You almost pushed me to my fucking death!" Rika blurts out. "You pushed first, girl." Mizo shrugged. "I also catched you  Not my fault you're a simpleton."

"SIMPLETON?!!!" Rika was about to crash out on Mizo but he left as she immediately turned around and saw the teacher. "Ah. O—okay." Rika ran inside the classroom.

_Rika is speaking to Kari, after classes.._

"Sooo.." Kari is smug. "Did you and that Mizo boy do it already?" Rika blushes. "W—what the fuck do you mean?? W—we're just acquaintances from last school year.." Kari chuckles. "I'm joking girl..!! But seriously, you've been talking with him a lot more ever since you met him last year in a group project." Kari puts an accusing finger on Rika's chest. "I know, I was there sis, don't even try to deny it!"

"Ugh.." Rika sighs. "Fiiinnnee...." Rika hesitantly admits. "Maybe, just maybe I like the guy a bit." Rika quietly says as Kari lightened up and squealed. "FINALLY SIS!!" Kari smiles. "Okay but what does that mean for you? You said you just exist around guys, and soon figured out you liked girls more, that's why you have me!" Kari winks and makes a peace sign.

"Buut~" Kari winks. "Maybe you literally haven't found the right guy, like all the adults say." Rika sighs, and shrugs. "I—I don't know— girl, like.. I definitely like girls, but I like him too. So, like.." Kari replies, "You're Bi! or.. Pan, but honestly, the difference is minimal. Don't worry, you're still an honorary sapphic, that's on me!" Kari winks. 

"Hehe.." Rika looks around. "Hope he didn't hear us. I will not voluntarily confess." Kari smiles. "Oh sure tsundere, you won't. But at this point?" Kari puts her hands on Rika's arms. "You don't need to, girl, and that's the best part!!" Rika tilts her head in confusion. "Haha, you are just like hi— Ahem. Yeah, no weird confessions or talks, just interact with him and the unspoken will be instinct."

Rika sighs and nods. _**"Hays, you're right.."**_

## A Broken Guitar

### Author's Note:

Inspired by my own broken guitar, but yeah, I feel and think I'm running out of ideas for whatever this has become, but yeah.

_ENJOY! I guess._

Rika and Mizo are silently walking with Kari to the local mall near the school as Kari yaps.

"So like— there was this pullover of some tricycle and car and when like I looked, there were no damages! So, I thought, hey wait, the two's tires did touch but— then why they're just.. there?!!"

The three arrive at the mall as Kari turns to them. "I have to go now, sisters~ My commute is from here, what about you two?" asked Kari, as Mizo spoke up. "I'll chill here a while before walking home.. but.." Rika speaks up, "I—I... um.. I also have a commute but.." Rika doesn't look at Mizo, but looks down, still.. the other two understand. "Okay! See you two tomorrow!" Kari then waved goodbye before walking to the tricycle drivers.

"Let's go in.. I—I have some words to say." Rika says as the two head inside the mall. "I—I actually haven't told you before, I—I figured it wasn't.. important, but.." Rika holds her hands to her chest. "My guitar broke.. T—the one since we met..?? Yeah, that one." Mizo responds, "Oh? Is.." Mizo hesitates but sighs and continues. "Is that why you wanted to play my guitar I brought?" Mizo gestured to the guitar case he's carrying.

"Y—yeah.. I—I've been careful to.. hide it. But, it's just eating me up inside.. and.." Rika sighs, and puts her head on his chest. "I—I don't want to be a bother when.. ugh.." Rika tries to speak but her mouth comes with nothing. "It's fine, I can give you this one—" Mizo says, but Rika pushes it back. "It's yours. Not mine. I—I already destroyed mine, y'know? W—why would you trust me with.. yours?"

"It's just a guitar, Rika.. I can buy you one on your birthday! Though I have to save up, but you get my point. Besides, losing it doesn't mean you can't borrow mine, I'll be there." Mizo reassured, as Rika pulls back. "My parents.." Rika sighs. "You know. How much. I hate them and just want to—" Rika holds Mizo's neck as he  then pulled her closer, they're in kissing range. "Haha.." Rika slightly chuckled as she processed the situation. 

"Pull back—" Mizo immediately does, making her wobble a bit. "Ah!" Rika slightly panicks as she brushes her own hair, but calmed down. "Right, um." Rika clears her throat. "O—oh, and another thing." Rika looks at Mizo's eyes directly. "I.." Rika blushes. "..lo— like you, right?" Rika caresses his face. "It's just.." Rika hugs Mizo again. "It's just been too much.. right now."

"The whole.. chaos, it revolves around me.. leaving nothing for you two." Rika reflects. "I just want to laugh, and be.. like us before, y'know?" Rika smiles slightly. "The Mizo-Rika duo, 'I can fix her' versus 'I'll ruin him'—" Rika hugged Mizo tightly as she blushed harder. "I—I mean.. I guess that's because we're getting older.."

 Rika tightly hugs Mizo one more time before pulling back. "I fear my future." Rika looks at Mizo. "I just hope— no, wish that you're in it." Rika says before Mizo was about to speak, then Rika interrupted him, "K—Kari too, idiot!" Mizo smirked as she sighed affectionally. "I—I also gotta go then, see you.." Rika hesitates before smirking, "..nerd." Rika then bolts.

**_"I.. guess that's life."_** Mizo reflects before also going home.

## Once a Day

### Author's Note:

Was writing this while sitting on the school benches. Thought of something and made this, tbh, this whole chapter has been the same _fluff_ + slight relationship stuff with echoes of the previous angst. Honestly, I have no idea what to write and will likely not slow down, but I might go more deviant and experimental. We'll see.

— jmb~ | 16:04 | July 3, 2025

Kari was busy with something again, so the two are chilling on the school benches. 

"Man, it's mosquito biting season, why the fuck are we sitting here?!" said Rika as she and Mizo sat down. "We're here to watch the show~" Mizo gestures to the C.A.T. happening right in front of them. "We're—?!" Rika stops herself as she sighs and looks. "Mhm." The two watch silently at first as the new 'cadets' are briefed with the first few basic moves.

"Y'know.." Rika says as she observes. "I thought it was done when they removed the club board thingy." Rika sighs. "Guess it was never meant to be." Mizo replied, "Rika, only our curriculum in the senior levels changed, I don't think anyone changed with this.. batch of students." Mizo stands up and looks around. "For as long as C.A.T. is mandatory for whatever damn bad reason, it's staying. And if it doesn't.."

"Kari will know, yadda yadda.." Rika brushes her hair. "Also, isn't it a bit weird three sections are doomed in one day, one hour?" asked Rika, as Mizo nodded. "Sure is. Likely something new, I guess." Mizo looks at the 'show' in front of them again. "I always wondered..." Mizo sits back down. "How does this cognitive dissonance between normal school stuff and 'miltary' apply?" Mizo wonders, "My guess is it's the same with politics and education." 

"There's a discussion of change, but little action." Mizo concludes, as Rika nods. "Yeah.. um.. whatever you said. I never saluted m— our officers unless Kari dragged me to them.." Rika sighs again. "Then again, we're all students.. Ugh, I just wished I didn't have to fake all the damn illnesses, or be in constant panic.." Mizo shrugs. "Rika, it's.. at least done. For now, to us."

"For now?!" Rika's slightly concerned. "Hah, well with the new curriculum, maybe never... Why so—" Rika shoved him as he stopped himself. "Ahem. Right, so.. where is Kari anyway?" Mizo continued, as Kari finally arrived. "Great timing! I can't wait to get out of this school!" Rika blurted out before standing up and going to Kari, being way too close, surprising Kari. "Oof— Rika! Umm, we're going right?" asked Kari as Rika and Mizo nodded.

"Please please we gotta go and get some ice cream right now—" Rika pleads as Mizo stands up. "I get it." Kari looks at the two in confusion. "Suuure.. Anyways," Kari looks behind her. "Wow, they still do this, huh?" Kari as the other two nodded. "Wait, don't you—?" Kari chuckled. "Nah, of course. But, yeah.. they're still doing stuff. This is probably going as long as the Philippines exist, and.." Kari shrugs. ".. it's not like I was particularly exemplary, and I joined GSP, so.."

"Shut it with the damn exposition—!" Rika decides to start walking ahead of them. "Hey—! I was reminiscing..?? I think.. Uh, bestie—" Kari catches up as Mizo sighs and also slowly does. Before he left though, he took one last look at the show and commented, "Through the darkest nights and brightest days, you're here, and if anything? It viscerally showed the hidden effects of this corrupt broken school system. So, I thank you for my revelation." to no one.

"Hey!! Dumbass!! Are you actually leaving us??" Rika shouts to Mizo. "Coming." Rika turns away before he can see a slight blush as Kari chuckled while he catches up.

## How to Love You?

### Author's Note:

To set the introduction chapter, as well as put out some notes; Firstly, I'd say it's fair if we up the sections by like two? Instead of 7 per month, we have 9. Why? Purely so arcs can stay more cohesive. For example, the interlude, meaning this chapter likely spans over months while something like 'Get Through This'. lasts one. I know, that the last one also lasted just a month, but that's why I made this. Anyways, no need for the devlog yet, as this is good enough for that.

As for the actual chapter, it's just a short story about the two on how the 'love' works, not sure if I can remember to keep up.. But, yeah, enjoy!

_'Rika wonders how Mizo feels for her, and if there's a difference between their love for each other, and other people. Mizo, is.. less than enthusiastic to think about it.'_

— jmb~ | July 07, 2025 | 00:00

...

"Ugh."

Rika looks at the post-rain school, puddles, mud, the usual feel of cold rainy cloudy day that by existing just makes Rika sad. "What is.. love?" Rika thinks about it. 

"I'm.. ugh. tired." Rika slumps over the railings. "So much obsessions.." Rika looks at her phone. "Yet so little.." Rika stops herself as she couldn't find the words. "What? Like.." Rika finds herself in that lone afternoon, where the only goal is to go home. She can't tell if Kari or Mizo is busy with school or just tired because of school as well, but she doesn't care enough to ask.

"Mizo.." Rika mutters, that name is both so important yet she feels so scared, she doesn't know why. "How is.. he?" asked Rika, as she gets her razor, it was given to her when Mizo entrusted her to not cut again, and she had no *intention* to, but she had always kept it in her purse, in that far off zipper she never goes through unless it was for something like, getting her backup anti-mosquito lotions and other random trinkets she hadn't bothered to leave at home. 

"What.. is.. my.. purpose?" Rika ruffled her hair up, the hairs tangling into a mess. "Is it to.. go and fall in love, have sex, have babies, work, parent— then what..?" Rika reflects. "It's funny, I'm supposed to have a family, or have a job — whatever is normal once I'm out." Rika sighs more shakily. "Right now? I.. just feel like I don't want this.. whole thing to end." Rika shakes her head. "At the same time? I also want it to."

"Wake up, do school stuff, go home, repeat and repeat until one day you find yourself, in somewhere you didn't think you'd be in, ugh.. I wish Mizo was here to perfectly explain whatever that is." Rika yawns before groaning. "How do I love someone?" asked Rika to herself. "I don't want to.. be a bad girlfriend, but it feels so hard just.. not letting myself be his. Let him shape me, I guess."

"I want to.. what do I even want??" Rika is very conflicted. Rika takes out her fruity iced tea drink and drinks it, another way of unhealthy coping she developed after one too many afternoons without Mizo. "I like him, but **loving** him?! Do I?!" Rika shouts, "I don't know what to think.. facing anyone is just so hard.." Rika drinks more. "It's just so hard to love dammit!!!"

Rika looks at the world below her in contempt. "Like, just so many damn issues and stuff, fucking.. everywhere I go, everywhere I exist.." Rika is a bit tipsy, yet she doesn't know why, they don't sell alcohol, and her household doesn't hold any significant amount of liquor. "Do I just kiss him, like — act like a normal ass girlfriend or something?? What is even one? Like, what am I supposed to do?? What.." 

Rika sighs. "What proves he loves me? What proves I am worthy to him?" Rika gets her bags. "Am I worth it?" Rika shakes her head. "SO POINTLESS??! So what?? He's not leaving me, right?? I—I fucking exist right?!! Just fucking tell me—" Rika's fists curl up so much, her nails bear crescents on her palms. "What's this stupid thing preventing me from— from doing any fucking thing?!"

"I'm.. desperately trying to keep the hangouts up, the fun!! They're tired!! I am tired! AHHHH!!!" Rika screams, but she knows no one could.. or should hear it. "I try to look happy. I am happy.. but it's just.. I don't want none of it to end... Fuck!!!!" Rika grabs her shoulder bag and flees to downstairs, as she scales down her 4th floor peak, she wonders what even is the point of thinking about this.

"It's— everything's fine right??? There's.. no conflict, or.. at least, serious ones. The friend group trio is close, and there's no major stressor yet?? Why do I still feel so tired.." Rika finally lands on the ground, as she rushes outside, though, the rainy and muddy atmosphere forces her to slow down occasionally.

***"It's just.. so.. everything's unfair!"***

Rika grumbles. "I should've just slept in..."

_Mizo POV_

"A note to send.. if need be."

"Dear Rika, I don't— I do.. need some time off of our.. relationship as well. I know our friendship stays, and that is totally cool."

"Nope. This sucks."

"My Rika, I love you—"

"Sappy, yet it's.. it doesn't reflect me."

"Rika. We're done."

"Too far."

"Rika, let's.. continue?"

"Ugh. Forget about this. I'm going to bed."

## Drain You

### Author's Note:

Something something, I don't know, uh.. somewhat good talk? I don't know how to describe it other than, acknowledgement and moving on, I guess.

_"Two souls intertwine, and find each other too attracting to repulse."_

"It's actually been so lucky I've met you, you know?" said Rika as she, Mizo and Kari were walking in the mall. "How so?" Mizo asked, as Kari felt the atmosphere, and excused herself, "I'm going..!!" Kari runs off.

"Why'd she go?" Mizo asked, as Rika visibly got irritated. "Because—!!" Rika emphasizes by shaking him on his shoulders. "Real talk tayo, obviously." Mizo tilts his head. "Okay..? Then talk." Rika pulls back. "Uhhh..." Rika shakes her head. "I—I mean— It's just so lucky we've met like.. at all! Like.. yeah." Mizo responds, "Yeah, circumstances like you are next to me the previous two years in class?"

"Then getting interested!! You get my point???" Rika adds, as she shits into another topic. "A—and like— the.. the dynamic— shit.." Rika says, as Mizo nods. "Is it on how we cope with each other?" asked Mizo as Rika is taken aback but sadly nods. "Yeah.." Rika sighs as she looks over the balcony they're nearby, Mizo follows. "It feels so safe, to.. offload on you, yet I don't know if it's 'healthy'.." Rika looks at Mizo. "Gets?? The lesson we had, about like stable relationships in the damn subject had Kari teasing us about it the whole day!!"

Rika blushes. "Not that I care of course, but.." Rika looks at Kari drinking milk tea below them, having fun. "It's just.. like— I'm so tired of.. constantly doubting myself and this relationship, and.." Mizo finishes for her, "**_we.. drain each other?"_** Rika is silent as Mizo adds, "You keep me grounded, I keep you sane. And the whole.. _transactional feel_ makes it feel.. bad?"

Rika sighs. "I guess..??" Rika looks around her, her hair all messed up. "And yet.. we still.. do these acts of love." Mizo corrected, "I do. You.. don't like them, don't you?" Rika shakes her head. "I—It's not like that, I'm just.. not a.." Rika sighs. "..sentimental? Like, basically, I don't know what to give to you than my mind, body, soul— and whatever that eery love line meant." Rika questions herself, stuttering. 

"I know I'm volatile— self destructive, all that— terrible damn labels, I just.." Rika grasps Mizo's hand. "I just want someone to match my terribleness.." Rika facepalms. "That's bad to say, think even.. But, it's what I desire, my belonging to... **anyone**. Especially you, you know? You helped me, and.. I can't ever repay any of it." Rika hugs Mizo, just to feel him again. "I'm so sorry for being so selfish for your support.."

Mizo is silent as he hugs her tight too. Then the two slowly pulled back. "Rika," Mizo sighs calmly. "..whatever disaster happens, we will communicate. No exceptions. Even if we.." Mizo looks away, narrowing his eyes. "..fight, bitch, and hate—" Mizo smirks. "..ahem. The best thing about us is that we can freely share with each other our thoughts, and be safe knowing the other won't hide their emotion." Mizo nods. "I'm not kidding. All those times, that.." Mizo looked into Rika.

"You were.. like.. unaffected? O—or seemed like it, that was.. your feeling? Like, how you were calm when I got.." Rika blushes. "..uh.. all red on Kari and you?" Rika smiles slightly. "I—It's.. like, you have no emotion or..?" Mizo smiles. "Mix. One, I didn't want your period to get worse. Two, this was something that was going to blow over. We're all friends, Rika, maybe you talked to her about it?" 

"Ah—! No—no! I swear. I didn't." Rika was lying through her teeth. "Right." Mizo says, as Rika nods. "Yuh—huh!" Rika says as Mizo chuckles. "O—okay but seriously, so.. um.. no tsundere?" asked Rika as Mizo shrugged. "I'm not going to force you to not act like yourself, Rika. Just be you and I'll be me, and we'll be a heaping pile of mess, together." Rika widens her eyes in slight affection before shaking her head. "I—I guess that's done." Rika mumbled.

Kari arrived coincidentally. "Heyy~! You two, want some milk tea? Don't worry, already paid..!  And— your favorites!" Kari gives a cafe un lait to Mizo and a cookie-n-cream milk tea to Rika. "My goshhh!!" Rika immediately drinks hers. "Is this truly free or are you extorting us for something?" Rika asks, mumbled because she had food in her mouth. "It is. Figured you two need.." Kari winks. "Some reward." Mizo asks, tilting his head to the left, "Hm? What for?"

**_"For being the two disasters who happen to be lovers and my best friends, cheers!"_**

*Rika grumbled and Mizo chuckled as they toasted.*

## A Burden to You

### Author's Note:

_While, they've seemed to talk and resolve this issue of their co-dependency, not everything's always perfect, and regression is bound to happen as the pressure mounts again in Honrato School.._

**Rika, again, falls into this cycle, how far can she ever hope to dream?**

_August 11._

On, another 'busy' day, Rika is 'chilling' (to the best of her ability) when, after a certain Mijo passed through with what seems to be in a hurry, Mizo appeared.

"Oh, uh.. Mizo. Hi." greeted Rika as Mizo stood beside her on the school balcony they were at. "So..." Mizo looks at her. "We.. haven't talked like this for a while, huh?" asked Mizo as Rika nodded. "Yeah, of course..." Rika gave a cold response as Mizo can already feel her very fragile self being very defensive if he ever tries to speak deeper.

"How was.. the math quiz score..?" asked Mizo as Rika shook her head. "It's low.. okay? Why would you even ask?? It's over anyway, a—and there's another one tomorrow— so it doesn't matter now." Rika's voice was unintentionally higher and she wasn't even looking at Mizo directly, her hair covering her face. "Well... I figured so, and wanted to.. help you, you know. Come over at my place, I guess."

"Oh?" Rika looks at Mizo, slightly irritated. "And you think you can do a better job at teaching me than myself?? Why offer now, huh?? You've been distant — speaking to Kari more than me, a—and it's just.. so exhausting, you know why I haven't tried to speak to you?" Rika holds Mizo's shoulder. "You keep leaving—! I don't know what I'm supposed to do if my so-called 'partner' forever can't deal with me at my worst—!!" Rika'a voice cracked as she sighed and looked away, covering up her tears forming.

"Rika, I—" Mizo sighs. "I—I'm sorry, alright? But you're—" Mizo cuts himself off, as Rika tensed up. "What am I?! Huh?! Tell me coward!! Who am I to you??" Rika immediately turned and pointed straight at Mizo's heart. "You're.. too much for me sometimes... okay...? Can I say that..?" Mizo held Rika's arm. "Or.. you're just going to scream and get mad at me, again?" Rika wrenched her arm away from him, as she stood there, slightly shaking.

"Y—you..." Rika was struggling to form words. "You really do, huh?" Rika holds her hands to her heart. "Fine. Fine.." Rika looks around before grabbing her bag. "You want to.. leave?? So be it, just..." Rika fully looks at Mizo. "Just say it to my face instead, idiot." Rika turns to leave not before Mizo called out, "Are you.. um.. by any chance on your 'time of the mo'—" Rika turns to scream, "NO??? That was almost two weeks ago?!! YOU—!!" Rika points at Mizo. "—WOULD'VE KNOWN if you wasn't so busy walking with Kari a—and Reva— whatever her name is..!!" Rika walks away fully.

Mizo sighs. "Worth a shot." Mizo wanted to joke about that, but it seemed he was too.. far away from Rika's heart to make any jokes.

## Oh, Me

### Author's Note:

Obligatory Nirvana titled Section!!!

Anyways, this one tries to develop some form of Mizo POV. I think this is the best way to put something like this, obviously, since the character reflects me sorta, he's the best way to put a reflective chapter that isn't mired with agony or misery.

Well, not entirely painful, but still is.

_"Pain, regret, and guilt flow through their wounds across boundaries crossed, maybe it's time..? Mizo thinks so, and he wants to go about it some way happier than what they were before."_

— jmb~ | August 07, 2025 | 9:15

_"If I had to lose a mile.."_

Mizo is walking home alone.

_"If I had to touch feeling.."_

Mizo looks at his hands, more specifically the palms of his hands, the remnants of his touch of Rika still so vivid.

_"I would lose my soul.."_

Mizo instinctively held his chest.

_"The way I do.."_

Mizo thinks about his writing.

_"I don't have to think, I only have to do it.."_

Mizo always, always held this little magical world in the pages of unlabeled notebooks and computer screens. Yet, it always seemed to be a lone endeavour, even with Rika, she.. always seemed so focused on herself.

_"The results are always perfect, but that's old news.."_

Mizo knows his excellence in languages is palpable, expertly maneuvering three languages in a world of characters built by him, with a little inspiration. It's just, no one seems to be as nerdy as him, at least.. Rika doesn't seem to be too well to see, he thinks.

_"Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?"_

Mizo always had not much emotion to show, though once or twice.. maybe too many times, he'd wish he could just show what he wanted someone to feel, or.. maybe he just wanted to be as vulnerable to Rika. He can't tell, he doesn't want Rika to further worry, she's.. just like that, very volatile, he wishes she wasn't, but then again, that's why she's herself.

_"Invented at your birth.."_

Mizo thinks back to the past, before high school, how did he get here, anyway? Even **he** can't tell, does it matter what happened before the pandemic? (yes, the COVID-19 one) He's doubting how his current writing and computer skills would've been seen before the pain of highschool angst.

_"I can't see the end of me, my whole expanse, I cannot see.."_

Mizo looks to the present, and the future. He has always thought about the future, it's just.. that future feels bleak. The steps of people around emphasize this in his mind. "People live in this world, in blissful grace or agonizing heat.. How do people expect each other, in moments, in-between the silence of everyday..?" Mizo thought.

_"Formulate infinity, store it deep inside me.."_

"The infinity of culture, the now, and wherever I go.." Mizo thought. "Is there a sign for everything?" Mizo adjusts his bag. "Everyone has the potential, but.. not everyone has the opportunity to.." Mizo adjusts his grey bucket hat. "..to write about their own stories, the synthesis and distillation of ideas, and broader.. culture." Mizo looks at the nearby park he's going straight to, to rest. ".. including Rika."

_"Rika, I wish you happiness, dear. I'm truly sorry for anything I've ever done wrong to you. But, we need to be.. separate, just for a while. I have made up my mind about this. If you think this is me leaving you, it is. My feelings have twisted beyond recognition, recognizing it requires me to.. move on for now. My Rika, I don't wish for you to hurt, but I'd need you to reflect. Just, for a while, without me encompassing your life. I feel that this is.. making us worse, being in each other's head, 24/7. I will return, don't worry, no deadlines, no rush. I believe there is peace, and perhaps warm waiting after the fog and mist clears between us. But, for now.. goodbye."_

**Sent by Mizo @ August 12, 17:00**

**Read by Rika @ August 12, 20:00**

_Silence, fills the air, but.. maybe it's for the better._

## Sa Isang Tingin

### Author's Note:

Woah, a rare non-english title! Anyway, this follows Rika's POV after the message.

The title is based off a certain song by my classmates, during one of the performances they had. After further deliberation, I decided to use one of the lyric here in Filipino, because.. I want to, hah. Mainly ecause it sounds more distinct than usual.

That's it, enjoy!

"That's.. how it is, huh?"

"That's how it ends..?"

"..."

_Rika is with Kari, August 13, on the balcony 4th floor, the exact same place where she last yelled at Mizo._

"Hey, uh.. what do you mean?" asked Kari as the rain started pouring down. "Mizo broke up with me." said Rika, trying to stay composed, but the hint of brokenness seeped through anyway. "Oh.. I see." Kari stepped back. "Um, do you..?" Rika shook her head. "No, I.. stay, please." Kari steps forward. "Here for you, bestie."

"..."

"Let's go out of here."

"Okayyy... To where?"

"Just the nearby mall for now, like.. like before."

"Okay!"

_As the two left, Rika couldn't help but look back at the classroom, where Mizo was.._

"Hey, Rika let's— oh.."

"Nothing nothing.. I swear. Let's go already."

"Oh, um.. Rika?" 

"Hm?"

"Rika.." Kari smiled. "Um.. is it okay if Reva joins us..? I just.. met her and.. uh.. yeah, I have a big crush on her so— kindly don't mention it and.. haha.." Rika's mind processed her statement. "Is she.. um— ahem, Kari." Rika holds Kari's shoulders. "Does she like girls??" asked Rika, as Kari blushed and shrugged. "I—I don't know girlie!! That's why I'm bringing you with me, to lessen the embarrassment—"

"Yo, Kari?" called out Reva as Kari froze, while Rika responded. "She's here." Rika looks at Reva, with narrowed eyes. "Oh, you're Mizo's girlfri—" Kari immediately interrupted, "O—oh!! That's right — they're not together now, um.. Reva, Rika can tell you the tea.." Kari looks at an amused Rika, before continuing, "...in the mall! Let's go ladies~" Rika scoffs but lets herself be dragged by Kari.

_At the mall.._

"Tables turn, Kari!!" Rika shouted, as Kari smiled awkwardly. "What do you mean, hm??" Kari asks, smugly. "Heh, let's just say a certain Kari was with me and Mizo.. and right now, I'm with Kari and Reva~" Kari chuckled it off but held Rika's hand tighter which made Reva amused. "You uh.. two, do you have some sort of..?" Kari immediately responded, "Hah! N—no, you misunderstand, Reva. Me and Rika are.. good pals! I mean it! No lies! I tell no lies." 

"It's true, she'd usually shut up if she's not telling the tru—" Rika avoids a slap and laughs. "I get it, so like.. you two have been.. friends, for a long time?" Reva says with that hidden subtext the two don't know how to convey. "Yes! Since three years ago!! BFF forever besties~" said Kari, as Rika nodded awkwardly. "Ahaha.. mhm. Yeah yeah. I—Sure." Reva shrugs, " Alright, what do you two wanna do anyway—"

_"Hey— Kari—!"_

Reva chuckled as Kari dragged Rika to the bubble tea store.

## Pwede Ba?

### Author's Note:

'Following the breakup, Rika doesn't know how she should.. feel anymore. Everything's like... a blur. A messy painful blur. She.. admits to Kari that she's not fully happy, but.. wants to keep hanging out with Kari, even as she has her own love to pursue'.

— jmb~ | August 27, 2025 | 9:35

---

"Um.." Rika looks everywhere else before looking at a Kari watching the people below them on the 4th floor, walk. "Is it.. normal to feel this sad?" asked Rika, as Kari's head went up and looked at Rika, concerned. "I mean.. depends, is it the school depression type or is it the relationship depression type?"

"Uh.. both? It.. It's both.. haha.." Rika brushes her hair. "Uh.." Kari awkwardly shifts as Rika decides to say it herself, "Mizo.. hah.." Rika looks away, "Um, Kari.. It's.. just.." Kari holds her breath, as Rika continues, "It's.. very hard to be happy about.. um.. you and Reva and all that... if.. he's.. still.. there.." Rika shakes her head, "Not that I don't want you two, nor do I hate going with you..."

"...I just.." Rika slumps over. ".. can't understand what I'm feeling right now, and.. without him, I.. I can't express it.. like I want to." Kari pats her back, "Hey bestie, it's fine.. I understand, and.. if.. you don't want to go with me and Reva, it's fine..! I—I mean, Reva already gets it, so.. no more of that, haha..!" reassured Kari, as Rika nodded but was still looking down.

"Ugh, I shouldn't have told you this.." said Rika as she looks away again. Rika takes a moment, expecting a question, but when Kari stood there, quiet she sighed again. Kari looked down and went closer to Rika. "I.. gotta be frank with you, Rika.. I.. don't know how to handle this, and I'd be lying if I.. didn't.." Kari holds Rika's arm. "..say I hate this part of you."

Rika was silent, tensing up before hugging Kari tightly, sobbing. No words needed to be said, they both knew the silence spoke louder than any reassurance.

_"..."_

"Kari, I should go home."

"..."

"Okay, Rika, just.. DM me when you're home, hm?" Kari smiled.

"..."

"Okay, I.." Rika stumbled on a word. "..promise." Before she tried to smile, it's a small one, but.. all she can manage.

## Jeepney to El Katipunan

### Author's Note:

'Like the sun, we'll live to rise..'

'Like the sun, we live and die (and ignite again).'

'Alerta! Katipunan!'

"Years (actually, just weeks) have passed since their 'breakup' but.. even in these days of school pressure and tense times, there's still momenets of reprieve and warmness."

— jmb~ | August 27, 2025 | 22:59

---

The jeepney ride is awkward, for Rika. It wasn't enough that she forgot her lunch bag at her room, when they're supposed to be traveling to like, Palay City, which while not that far, is still approximately fifteen kilometers away from Honrato and Cab City. It's that Mizo, this.. 'dumb idiot' is.. right in front of her. 

While Kari was humming to herself, and Reva sleeping on her shoulder, Rika was stuck on this.. 'not staring' contest. She knows that Mizo's POV meant if he was looking at any other person, he'd be looking straight at her, but 'coincidentally' he just so happened to avoid her gaze all the time.. not that she wanted to look at him, anyway.

Unfortunately, she had to listen to the noises around her, lest herself be caught off guard by whatever happened. So, as she was trying to chill herself and tone out the chatter around her, she was again, thinking of Mizo. Well, not that he was important... but, she had to forget about him, the last two weeks were exams and performance tasks galore.

"Narrator, shut up, we're about to set out.."

But alas, even in this case, she was listening to me waffle about her as she was busy walking..

"Ugh, just.. just.. whatever, just don't distract me."

Anyway, as she walked, the somewhat bright yet clouded sun gazed as she contemplated the circumstances of these many students in this one musical theater. Well, it didn't really matter if this was optional or not, she liked history, especially this period.

"Stop, stop.. stop monologuing.. I.. I can handle it, now."

Then, Rika go right ahead, speak your story.

"..."

"To be frank, there's not much to say.."

"Like, I'm stuck in this stupid line of people, packed like sardines all being warmed up by the laser of the sun! You know what, having random white tarpaulin over us doesn't help.. it makes this.. **_worse.._**"

The line moves... five centimeters.

"Ugh.. why is there even a stupid task to take a picture with that teacher, imagine getting out of this stupid line just so—" Rika looks around and sees Kari and Reva go to the teacher she was thinking of, take a selfie picture with him then post it to the GC as they head to her position. "Ugh, damn it... couldn't have just—?!" Rika shut  herself up, before looking away. "Whatever.." 

The line moved another five centimeters.

"Can we just skip this??"

_Fast forward to way after the musical theatre show.. 14:00_

"Okay, maybe that was a little too far, you didn't even see the almost trampling of each other when we entered the theatre, or when I sat on the most isolated place I could access, eventually being surrounded by elementary kids.. Then the walk to the jeep.."

"Hey, Rika, who are you talking to?" asked Kari, as Rika turned slightly red and shook her head. "No one—! Y—You're here.." said Rika, as she, Kari and Vera entered the jeep. "Hey so, ahem..   Code M was nearby us, like.. when we were chatting in our GC, he was just.. locked in.." said Kari as Reva added, "Mhm.. too distracted, likely by the story.."

Mizo arrives and coincidentally sits beside her, because the girl who was next to her sat where Mizo was and they switched seats. "Eek! What the fu—" Rika was glaring at Mizo, as Kari and Reva were trying not to laugh. "Mizo..." Rika grumbled as Mizo, who was not paying attention, finally looked at her. "Hm? Rika, what?" asked Mizo, as Rika stumbled on her words, a bit irritated. "W—Wha—? What do you mean, **what?**"

Mizo looked at her unamused before sighing. "What.. are you looking at me for?" reiterated Mizo, as Rika shakily sighed. "Oh, I.. don't know,  I thought we agreed to something??" responded Rika, as Mizo stifled a chuckle. "Welp, not much choice, is there?" Mijo looks past Rika as the jeepney begins to move. "Besides, it'll only be a while, you can handle that, can't you?" Rika was struggling to form words before the class realized the jeepney couldn't move out so they had to get off then push it.

Of course, Mizo, already nearby decided to help the other boys (read: yes, only the boys) push the jeep out of the mud that the jeep was stuck in. Mizo had gave her his phone and panyo (handkerchief) as the jeep was pushed and pushed, eventually getting it out. As the class moves in, Rika quietly gives him his belongings, as he held her right hand using his left as he sneakily directed her inside. Rika didn't really pull back but damn it she feels weird again.

As the jeep slowly drove on, the rest of the ride was spent Mizo quietly either watching his phone, the road or.. Rika as she tried to sleep while looking very intently at Kari stroking a sleeping Reva's hair.

When the jeep stopped, and people went out, Rika's hand was held by Mizo as people walked around. "You doin' okay?" asked Mizo, as Rika was a bit surprised, her heart pounding slightly faster. "As okay as you can be.." answered Rika, as Mizo made Rika, who was looking away look at him. "That's alright, it.. takes a while to recover." Mizo looks around, "Well, I'm heading home. See you tomorrow, Rika." Mizo turns to leave before Rika answered, "You too, just.." Mizo stops on his tracks. "..warn me next time, idiot.." Mizo nods and leaves as she sighs and heads off to the classroom where Kari and Vera are heading.

## For As He Drifts

### Author's Note:

Combined parts into one section, as I plan to take this into another direction, idk what, but I hope more in-line with the romcom style, mixed in with slice in life, and other cool things. Of course, I won't forget the angst, but it's going to be a lingering phantom pain, more or less.

This, is the setting chapter that will hopefully make the events steer into hopeful, or at least, less depressive episodes back-to-back, and awkward tension.

_(September 3)_

_"I convinced myself I was bulletproof.."_

Rika was ruminating again, and alone. Before this, she asked Kari, alone and quietly to leave her alone for that and the next week;

"H—hey, I—" Rika looks away and hides her shaking hands to her back. "I don't mean for you to take it hard on yourself but.." Rika was struggling to say the next few words as her fingernails dug onto her own skin to make her say, "I think.. I think you should leave me alone.." Rika further digs in, her nails moving to her arm. "M—maybe just this week?" Rika shakes her head. "Next week too.." Rika starts dragging her nails before she immediately said, "Goodbye!!" Rika rushed away.

Rika looked down on herself, for as much as her skin didn't show much other than the old cuts she already had on her left arm, the still healing scratches made her queasy. 

_"Scream for help and no-one ever heard the truth..."_

**"Mizo."**

Rika looks up. "Our promise.." The sun, while not seen in these cloudy days are something Rika doesn't look forward to. When the sun shines down, it usually meant the heat bearing down on her poor soul, while somehow still having the humid atmosphere of the rain early that day. "In my hands, show me how to live.." Rika mumbled something she vaguely remembers from a song she listened to, though it is probably very inaccurate.

_"I've been told it all feels wrong. Why does it all feel so wrong..."_

"I'm so.." Rika starts crying, she's lucky she's alone on that school balcony at the fourth floor. "Fuck, man.."

_"Loneliness inside.. I wait for paradise, but it never came and I sat here paralyzed."_

"..."

"Hey, when you're running out of meaning, where do you find it?" asked Rika to Kari, as they're on the balcony, chilling with the heavy wind. "Uh.." Kari looks down. "Friends, my hobbies, and.. Reva." Kari looks at Rika, before looking away. "Sis, I don't know why you're asking.." added Kari, as Rika chuckled and shrugged. "I don't know either."

Rika pulls back. "Maybe I'm just too lost in fanfiction or something but.." Rika trails off. "Burnout?" Rika chuckled. "I know what burnout looks like.. it'd be.. it'd be exhaustion. It'd be irritation, but.. ughhh..." Rika looks down. "I'm sorry, this is just confusing, is it?" Rika looks at Kari. "I—I'm sure.. things will... fix itself. Maybe? But I don't really know how to.. talk, feel, or think about whatever mess happened, so.." Rika holds Kari's hand. "Just.. let's go.." 

_Run away, sail away.. Be afraid, be afraid.._

"Sure." said Kari, nodding. "There's not much I can do other than comfort you, and stay by you as a friend, right?" asked Kari, as Rika hesitated to answer, but nodded. "Yeah.."

_I, I will drown you out.. I will hear no sound, I will not be found.._

So, Rika takes one more look at the sky, before leaving with Kari, to something, someone she can just.. hope to attach her feelings to, without Mizo, or any of the trauma from her years in this school, just.. something to feel for herself, other than intense sadness, dread or longing.

## Cherry Bombs

### Author's Note:

Uh.. I'm trying something out.

See if it worked!

_(September 7)_

_An unspecified super mall at Cab City._

"Young lady, me and dadi are just going to get some shirts and pants, you go with Kari, okay?" said Rika's mom before she patted her shoulder and left. "Whew.. never knew your parents.. uh.. were that nice..?" commented Kari, as they headed up. "Nice..? Well, it is my birthday.." Rika commented. "If they weren't even a little bit gracious, especially since you're here, it would be embarrassing." 

Kari nodded as she looked around, saw some of the girls' section of clothing, the toys section and the arcade nearby. "Ooh, are you looking for new nerf guns or something?" asked Kari, as Rika shook her head. "The disruptor I got took a lot of convincing, and I didn't even get to use it much. Nerf darts are very expensive, and wasteful.." Kari narrowed her eyes, and stepped in front of her, stopping her dead in her tracks. "Heyyy, are you still not over.. Mizo? This isn't like you, you know. Being all analytical, not enjoying the fun~!" Kari commented.

Rika is silent before sighing, "Ugghh.. It's complicated, but.." Rika shrugged. "Look, I am not as.. complicated as the guy is. Like, he's.. so insistent on this.. I don't know actually. But, what I do know is that he keeps people straight at the edge, just.. close enough.. I guess I'm kinda why so.. but..." Rika looks down then swishes her hair back. "..Anyways! This is not Mizo's day. It's mine. His is like.. December Two or something." Rika moves forward as Kari steps aside. "Where's Reva anyway?"

"She's coming... She was just bothered by some family matters, I think." said Kari, as Rika nodded. "Alright, then." Then they both entered the arcade as they looked around the endless row of machines. "Okay, Kari.." Rika grins. "Of course! I know exactly what you're thinking sis," Kari pushes Rika to the counter. "You pay for it~" Rika blushed as she turned around to face Kari to chew her out but when Kari went close to her face she sighed. "Hmph. Your girlfriend wouldn't be so happy if she saw you, seeing other women."

Kari smiled. "Oh she knows about us, and.. she's fine with it, mostly." Rika slightly opens her mouth in confusion as Kari traces the middle of Rika's chest. "As long as when she arrives, she takes priority. Simple!" Kari pulls back. "But! As a best friend's gesture, I'll pay for us three." Kari switched herself with Rika, who was speechless. "₱150.. okay. Thanks.." Kari got some packs of arcade coins, as she shoved two of them into her pants' pockets.

"H—how..?" asked Rika, as Kari put her finger on Rika's mouth. "A lady's secret, obviously." Kari chuckled before putting her hand away. "Nah, I'll say it. I just buy men's pants in my size." Rika nodded as she looked at the now free drum arcade game. "Look, look! Let's play that!" Rika quickly rushed there, as Kari followed. "Gimme." Rika took one of the coins from the packet and put it in to start. "Alright, let me just.."

_Rock N' Roll — 13 yrs above_

"Sure is young.. but.. okay whatever." Rika selects it, and suddenly the world around them transforms into a small stage, with the game's pixelated visuals of an audience in front of them as she sees a real drum kit in front of her, while Kari is now carrying a guitar and Reva, who just arrived, is carrying a bass. "W—what the—?!" Rika says before;

`Hello, welcome to the experimental mode of Drummen On Arcade Game! We hope you enjoy, and as always, you can exit by tapping the hologram right.. there!`

The three look at the hologram at the top of Rika's arcade game, which tells Rika to press on its screen, then to continue, tap on a tom. "Uh.. how do we..?" 

`Pick a song! This is connected to the internet's music, and so will have access to a wide selection! Though, only updates daily, when the arcade closes.`

"So specific.. uh.. might be a beta test reminder or two.. A—Anyway Kari.. Reva?! Umm.. what do y'all wanna play?" asked Rika, as the two looked at each other and grinned. "You decide, birthday girl! Besides, we uh.. don't know how to play these so.. like.. good luck lol?" replied Kari, as Reva added, "How did this even happen? Well, you uh.. I guess you gotta finish it." 

"Um.. let's do something easy." Rika turns to the hologram and pressed to pick as a keyboard appeared. "Smells.. Like.. Teen.. Spirit. Should be easy." Rika pressed start, as she sat down and tested, jammed her drums as the others do so. "Who's singing?" asked Kari, as Rika shrugged. "I dunno, maybe we're just the instruments. After all, think I saw a karaoke arcade nearby." 

_The song starts playing as the others hurriedly get ready._

Then it starts, Kari sees that it's like guitar hero simplified, and so she is able to keep up, same with Reva, but with some misses. Rika knows the song by heart, and so does it perfectly. She's muttering the song lyrics as she uses the drums, while the others keep up. 

_A denial!_

"Whew.." Before Rika could say anything more, they're suddenly back to the arcade where they're looking at the screen with a good score, as they get given... ten tickets. "Wow, all that for.. this much..?" asked Rika, as Kari was grumbling. "Hmph. We tried our best and we didn't even get rated?? Scam. We should just have sat down and let Rika play." Kari commented, as Reva nodded. "Yeah.. I was disoriented too, I just arrived and I immediately got sucked in."

"Jeez, okay maybe that was.. huh?" said Rika as they turn to the screen, the 'Rock N' Roll' mode was gone. The usual kid-friendly stuff was there. "Either we did illegal meth and weed, maybe some of those mushrooms to hallucinate that or it was a one-time thing." Rika looked at her tickets. "But there's nothing here indicating that. Oh well." Rika looks at the big yellow fake drum on the arcade machine. "Man, looks broken. It probably wouldn't be.."

"Rika! Just like.. try again, maybe?" Kari gave her one more coin as Rika inserted again, but it was the usual kid stuff. The 'Happy Birthday' and 'Jingle Bells' type. Rika decided to try Jingle Bells, but it was as mildly infuriating, and boring to watch as they all thought it'd be. "Dammit, yellow!! Work work!!" Rika tried making her hits stronger but she also was cautious, she clearly wasn't the target audience yet it was still destroyed before she was using it.

_Done! Good enough! B Rank! Get your tickets!_

"Ughh.." Rika got the seven tickets and turned to the group. "Let's.. move on.." The three all agreed silently after Rika said that. 

The group moved to the other side, as they chatted. Reva started, "I wished there was a mini ice hockey here, like you use the small ones to.." Rika interrupts, "Yeah yeah I knowww right?? It's just, like.. there's the samgyup place mom wants to try and.. well, you know, I couldn't actually refuse, since then she'd ask, where? And uh... I'm like.. I dunno."

"Oh, right! Reva, did you remember to—" Kari was asking Reva before Rika interrupted, "Um.. if it's about payment, they said uh.. like, they'd pay all of it off, but will.. uh charge you? I dunno what.. you should be careful, haha.." Kari nodded. "Uhuh yeah, um.. it's like.. 450.. or something.." Kari and Reva both pulled up their wallets and looked at the bills before nodding. "I think we're good if your parents are particularly cruel, anyway, let's continue!" said Kari, as they look to the arcade machine that uses plastic guns connected to the arcade.

"Oh, it's the one that's very hard to play because the sensor's very off." Rika got on player one, and Kari and Reva hesitated to see who was playing player two. "Babe, you should try this one, we can like switch if you die, heh." said Kari, as Reva chuckled. "Alright, alright, just watch my back, and maybe step a little back?" The two were admittedly very close, Kari at Reva's left side. "Ehe~" Kari stepped back as she inserted the two coins. "Start!" Rika exclaimed as the two selected the two-player mode and immediately skipped the beginning cutscenes.. well, Rika did, anyway before Reva had the chance.

At first, both were struggling, as they got through rows of men. "Ugghhh this fucking sensor sucks I wish—" Again, before Rika could finish they got sucked into the game, Rika sees Reva first, wearing the clothes that the guy in the arcade game was. Rika looks down at herself, same thing. Rika looks around, somehow Kari was dragged in, as like a new player three or something. "Why do we keep getting sucked in, unconsenting??" Rika shouts, exasperated as she switched to her machine gun, somehow. 

"Maybe you have powers, Rika! This is the second time!" Kari says as she gets to cover and uses a gatling gun. "How the—" Kari winks as she mows down the enemies. "Kai, how helpful of you~" Reva says as she equips the grenade launcher to destroy the helicopter landing. "Let's move!" Rika focused on the fight, she wasn't going to ask why, it was indeed helpful.

They go through mini robot bugs, spiders, big men with shields, a helicopter mission where Kari got to fire missiles that one-shot people per 3 second reload as Rika and Reva use the .50 cal provided. Then, a cave mission, where Kari just shined the light so that any enemy is instantly shot.. The three were unstoppable, they couldn't be shot, since the only actual danger to the three were explosives, which the three easily took down anyone that had one. Even the boss before they won the first stage, since it was a three sided battle, the three just took one side and easily sniped the boss. After so, more missions into mansions, airports, and fortresses, but eventually, they arrived at like this underwater fortress or something, and the two used the machine gun, Kari the gatling gun to shoot and stun the boss until he's defeated in a dramatic cutscene as the three realize and fire their guns to the sky, flooding the thing, just before they're taken out back to the arcade.

"..."

"Holy shit, I did not know.. how long.." Rika was panting and looked at Kari, whom was looking at Reva, and their empty coin packets. "Tiring.. but fun!" Kari says as they go sit down on the chairs nearby. "We didn't die once, why are our coins spent, Kari?" asked Rika, as Kari shrugged. "I dunno, maybe that was the price of that.. experience.." The three were still breathing heavily and recovering. "Why do we.. look like we actually went through the whole thing.." Reva commented, their hair, doesn't matter if they were tied up earlier were now all over the place.

"My arms.. so much recoil.." Rika stretches and adjusts her arms. "I had to carry a gatling gun, Rika.. trust me, dealing with those and the stupid reoccurring bugs and insects out to kill you.." Kari scoots closer to Reva as Reva holds Kari on her chest. "Hmph... unfair..." Rika stretches her arms again, moving to different stuff. "Heh.." Rika begins to close her eyes as she sees Reva kiss Kari on the forehead as they smile at each other. "Guess.. I should.. dream about it.." said Rika before she fully closed her eyes.

_Later.._

"So, uh.. this is where we separate." said Rika, holding her guitar case as the other two nodded. "Mhm, thanks to you, and your parents for the meal.. Gosh, it was so awkward having to act around your parents in that buffet place." said Kari, as Reva nodded. "Yeah, thanks." Reva added.

"Um.. yeah.. this.. was a great birthday, thanks, girls." Rika hugged the two in a friend's hug before she pulled back. "This.. ah.. I didn't get the privacy I needed, but I swear, I felt so awkward trying to decide of a guitar." Rika shifted. "Like, I'm a gal so this or that, whatever." said Rika, as Reva commented. "I.. uh.. something I learned of buying guitars, is.. your one is.. quite cheaply made yet you said, it was.. ₱2500?" Reva turned slightly concerned. "Just.. be aware of what makes a guitar last than listening to the lady guilding you."

"Yeah yeah," Rika had a faint smile. "Mizo would've said the same thing... Probably bought it for me." The two nod. "Welp, gotta go. See you two~!" Rika bids Reva and Kari goodbye. "Well, I'm going home, are you?" asked Kari to Reva. "Mhm, it just so happens we are headed to the same direction." Reva answered as they headed away.

## Origami Stars

### Author's Note:

A bit inspired lol, but mostly O.C., anyway.

Also, slight angst??

_The intramurals are booming, and Rika finds herself at a standstill._

"Girls... I really don't know if I should give Mizo a star.. or.. even do this.. star thing in the first place." said Rika, as Reva and Kari make little origami stars, some decent, some can be mistaken for crumpled up paper. "I mean, you can start now or delay later.." replied Kari, as Reva added, "It's.. mandatory, besides.. I don't think he's getting one." Kari looks at her concerned, before she sees Rika looking somber and nodding. 

"I... know, right. He's like.. he's not exactly lonely, but he isn't brimming with friends exactly." Rika dared to look at Mizo's direction, who was busy sleeping before he had to go help the school newspaper in the social media information division. "You know, Rika.. It's a shame you didn't join like.. any sports!" Kari commented, "You totally would've carried the CODM division~" Kari smiled as the three chuckled. "Bruh, I don't play it anymore, besides. Everyone else who joined was way more capable than me.." said Rika, as she looked at the origami stars the two are making.

"Uh.. how many are you two making anyway, perhaps you can like.. just make two for me, hehe?" asked Rika, as Reva answered, "Hah. It's.. It's a lotta people. GSP, other friends.. Oh, and since we're talking about it.." Reva pushed the ones labeled 'R' to Rika. "Me and Kari made these, don't worry, you'll know who each is~" assured Reva, as Rika faintly smiled and took each and put it into her pink wallet.

"Um.. I guess.. I'll make some.. five's the limit right? I'll give uh.. one each to you two, then.. three." Rika looks down. "For Mizo."

_Silence.._

"Here." Reva gave Rika a paper strip. "Start."

_Later, Mizo was eating lunch, as Rika went, and sat down next to him._

"Hey." Rika called out. "Rika." Mizo looked at her. "Whaddya want..?" asked Mizo, as Rika looked away and gave him three stars. "Don't.. open it yet. Just, just.. open it later, after school." said Rika, as Mizo gasped and rushed to his bag and grabbed two purple and pink stars and gave Rika those. "I'm not implying anything, those were just the papers I had." Rika silently took them, trying to stop her shaking.

"Same principle." added Mizo, as he continued eating. The two sat there, quietly looking away before Rika cleared her throat. "A—aren't you going to say something?" asked Rika, as Mizo mumbled, "I dunno.." through his food filled mouth. "Ah, right.." Rika put her hands on her chest. Mizo swallowed his food. "You.. want to talk? I.." Mizo's eyes darken. "I'm sorry, I'm.. kinda busy." Rika nods frantically. "N—no! I—It's nothing really, I—I know, you and your writing stuff.." Rika stands up. "T—then, I—I should go, and let you... um.. bye!" Rika waves goodbye before running away.

_Read the stars.._

"..."

Rika opens her pink star.

"To say, I love you speaks little of my deep complicated feelings, and disrespects what we had."

Rika opens her purple star.

"But to say nothing would be worse, and so I must say; You're.. nice to be around, funny and quite comforting."

"..." Rika was silent. "I—I.. okay, n—not.. that.. bad.. I guess..?" Rika gets the papers. "I—I should probably do the rest of the activity.."

_Sparkling in the skies.._

Mizo opens his star, the yellow one.

"I, love you, but.. I don't know how to, and.. you've always been there to love me, and.. I just want to give you the same feeling!"

"Don't try.. I don't know either." Mizo commented before sighing and getting the other maroon star and opening it.

"I want to always be there for you, and I know you promised me too.. You've.. always held me, even when I think I don't deserve it."

"..." Mizo shakily sighs. "It's.. basic empathy." Mizo thinks before, "I.. also didn't want you sad all the time, that's.. what lovers do, right..?" Mizo gets the red star and opens it.

"I feel so weird, so unsure, so unsafe.. and.. I.. feel you're the only one that can anchor me, and make me wake up, thank.. you."

"..." Mizo nods. "It's.. a bit more complicated than that." Mizo looks away. "But, I understand, you cannot fit emotions this mixed in a few affirming sentences." Mizo looks at the papers. "The inherent assumptions of these activities, cruel to the divergent, and performative in the sense of the outside look of these relationships.." Mizo shakes his head. "Whatever, I'll just.. do the activity."
