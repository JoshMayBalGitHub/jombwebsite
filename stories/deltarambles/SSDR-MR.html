## Gacha Procrastinación

## Author's Note:

Can you tell where I found the will to write this? Well, it's pretty simple. If Honkai: Star Rail can ruin my late evening, so will I too. Everything here is fictionalized of course, but is based on some true feelings and topics I felt willed enough to write.

Oh, and the reasons for like the specification of Mizo and Rika, the names was because I was writing this as I sent it over to help get opinions on it, you know, stuff.

— jmb~

"Ugh.. I am so.. tired right now.. So much work I did earlier duuude.. And I had to face the teachers like I didn't know that I was already late in passing my tasks.. Like, seriously..! Three performance tasks..! I.. just can't.. justify how.. I just.. misplaced the time that was required, like seriously.. I am so disappointed at myself for being so indulgent, not realizing the impending occurrence of my life.. I know, I know.. You're suffering too, but I swear, even you can just.. just.. pass some of them on time, while I have barely passed the 3 I needed to do.. since last week..!" She said, frustrated and also clearly agitated.

"Haha.. yeah.. Um.. I get it. But, if I may ask, what's the progress..?" I asked her, she clearly was a bit agitated but restrained herself from saying anything before responding;

"Oh you know, nothing. Barely a draft for that essay, barely a scrap of drawing for that comic task, and especially only a concept for that brochure.. Don't even ask, you know." She said, rolling her eyes.

"I.. yeah. But, you know.. I just, want to check up sometimes..?" I say, as she sighs and brushes her hair before turning to face me, with an annoyed yet regretful face.

"Did you know, what I spent my time doing instead..? Play this stupid video game where I sit around and do puzzles for 50% of the time, auto combat 20% and you know what.. almost all of them have this.. this long ass fucking dialogues with more yapping than one girl can handle in one night..! You wanna know the worst part? I DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING.. COMPLETE IT! I WAS STUCK ON THIS.. this boss, spoilers.. but this guy's pretty strong, and when I tried to fight it, I realized one thing. You need the new characters, with their builds ready, even just the DPS to beat that boss. Unless you want to suffer finding out why that's the case, take my advice." She said, before slumping on the chair, adjusting her glasses as she took deep breaths, while I processed what she said.

"I haven't.. played through that yet.. I just pulled because I wasn't that interested in for the reruns.. and well, I got the banner character. Only barely made it through, like around the.. Okhema arc..?" I said, as she looked up at me and smiled menacingly.

"Okhema huh.. When you just arrived.. hmm?" She said, before standing up and looking at me intensely. "Don't be an idiot like me. Realize that the 10 hour gameplay isn't lying. There is more yapping that's going to happen. You're lucky you have the previous pulls. I had to go around for.. 7 HOURS! Combined. In a span of two nights, to get the character. Be gracious in your luck, Mizo." (Mizo's my name) She said, as she crossed her arms and looked away.

"Alright alright.. Yeah, I.. don't spend much time in these games anyway, gotta write and all. So if you're procrastinating with gacha games, I'm procrastinating on my novel which will never be seen by anyone..!" I say, with a smile, feeling a bit ashamed by advertising my novel.

"Yeah yeah, your novel. Cool writer, learnt to use it on research?" She said as I looked at her with an amused expression. "Hitting hard I see, want me to remind you what you just said to me..?" I say, forming a sly smile.

"Psssh. Shush it then. Now, before I forget, help me figure this fucking essay." She said, dragging me to the chair next to her and making me look at her newly opened up laptop screen, with barely any words on a document, then she scrolled down, revealing rants about the gacha game, then the story we were supposed to review, then her parents before it stopped to show a singular huge image of the word 'The' with elegant writing.

"Here's where we start." She says.


##  Thy Night

## Author's Note:

I don't know if this is related but, it gotta be here because it's something I'm explorin'

By the way, the perspective, it's from a character's viewpoint. Not me.

"You know, I never understand the appeal of tight clothes.. I mean, they're just so uncomfortable to wear y'know.. And and besides, if you're going outside, best bet you'll be freezing or melting depending on time of year..! Worst part is, they often show everything your body's gotta offer, and you know, I'm not as.. uh.. pretty as other girls, you get me.. Those girls that somehow stay thin during high school even with all the stress..! When I'm in my baggy and large shirts and pants because of my height.. and ugh.. weight, I think somehow it just.. well I don't think about it but you know, especially during that school party we had, I had an all dark blue pants, polo, fedora hat and blue sling bag! But when I saw the other girls, dresses, purses.. Yeah, that's why I was so focused at drinking the soft drinks they sold.. Gets?"

I said, "Yeah, but I don't see how that'll affect your enjoyment. I.. uh.. was busy with others, so I only saw you occasionally buying and drinking cold soft drinks, looking off to wherever happened to be interesting.. You even messaged to me about reading that book you got in your exchange gift while the stage was speaking about something, you said you got bored after a while but didn't want to waste anything so uh.. you drank.. like last time."

"Mhm. I.. ugh. Just, look.. Even if you know, what I know.. Sitting together on that night seemed icky to me. You, boy, and me, girl.. Even if we're supposedly only best friends and are sibling-like.. I'm.. just saying..! Hey, you didn't tell me what you did by the way... This is the first convo we're having since you blacked out on my messages.."

I responded with; "What..? I.. just said.. that I was pretty tired.."

She responded, "Uhuh.. But I did see you standing there talking to your make friends, so obviously.. you still weren't tired that time, even if it was close to closing.."

I said, "What..? I thought you already left.. um.."

She said, "Yeah, I messaged you saying I was leaving, not that I left. Look, I don't care about that, but it's obvious that you ignored me during that time."

I said, "It slipped out of my mind.. Shucks.. Sorry, then."

She responded, "Nevermind about that. It was dumb of me to assume you weren't busy all night.."

"I.." I looked away after this, processing her words. She was about to continue, but then stopped too, stuttering before going on her phone and going farther to a nearby seat.

"Why.. did.. she.. why is she so.. clingy? I don't.. Should I.. I.. this is so much.. Damn.. I gotta face her atleast, but what response..?" I thought to myself, eventually turning to face her, using her phone.

"Hey Rika." (Rika was her name) I called out, before she looked up at me and was clearly annoyed and almost glaring at me. "What..? Mizo?" She said, clearly with a hint of annoyance in her voice (Mizo's my name)

"I.. want to just.." I mustered the courage to say it. "Apologize.. It's all I can do."

"Apologize.. huh?" She said, as silence appears between us.

"Don't..  be like this, Rika. I just.. didn't.. I was.. just.. making some other connections, you understand.. right..? We talked about how.. it'd be better if we tried to talk with other people." I say as she is staying silent, opening her mouth to speak, but mumbling something then stopping as she pressed her phone closer to her chest.

"Mizo." She says as she puts away her phone. "Let's go." 

She stands up and drags me, then we walked to an arcade, she then spoke up, "Let's just have fun." she said, with a seemingly hurt tone, but trying to hide it.

And well, we tried to atleast, we went to a bunch of machines, we started with;

"Ooh! The mini ice hockey thing, let's do that." I say, as we then go and grab some play coins that totalled to around 50 then we started playing.

It went pretty well, after the mini ice hockey thing, we went to the basketball one, the driving one, the shoot-em-up one, then final, the vr shooting one, after that we ran out then raced each other to a milkshake tapo drink store, I ordered iced coffee with pearls, she ordered, after looking at me then listing out the options while shaking me she eventually chose, the matcha one with pearls and a lot of sugar and iced tea. We sat down and this is the convo that followed;

I was panting as we sat down on some fake grass in an indoor park in a mall, and she said, "Well.." 

"Well.. what?" I asked, as I patted her shoulder. 

"Well, wasn't that fun..?" She asked, with a smile that seemed genuine.

"Yeah.." I said, drinking some coffee.

"Yeah. It is. Now.." She said, drinking her coffee then turned to me, staring directly into my eyes.

"Mizo. I.. don't.. wish to.. strain anything. I.. don't.. want to lose you, like.. earlier. I know.. I might be a little.. well.. clingy.. But, I just.. want you to know, I.. won't just.. leave like that, okay..? I know you have your own.. stuff to do, and I have mine.. Just, remember me sometimes.. okay?" She said, as she gently touched my hand and looked at me intensely.

"Oh, um.. I will.. then. Haha.. Promise." I say, as we do a pinky promise, then we awkwardly hugged and pulled back quickly, I couldn't see.. but I think she was embarrassed too.

We just chatted and drinked after that.. That's the end.

## Dreadful Memories 

## Author's Note:

You can tell who I based this off. Anyway, another story. I'm starting to from this on out, this is now a spinoff of deltarambles. This is not an alternate timeline though, more of a story that happens in a larger one. Who knows? They might get some cameos, but.. for now, they're just the vaguely high school pair going through life, without the big magic and world ending events in their head.

Maybe just indulgent, but I'm willing to write until I don't want to, and that's the freedom I've been missing with the main deltarambles story. Longer plot points are good, but they do take a considerable amount of time now, even with a more fast writing.

I was walking, when I saw her, Rika. I walked up to her to greet her but I stopped myself when I saw she wasn't in her usual cheesy tomboy-ish happiness, she was more of the depressed one. "You're here." She says.

"I'm.. here. Yes." I say, I try to gauge her reaction but she seemed to stay in that exact neutral face, with a hint of sadness. "Sometimes, all someone needs is a little push. But, what if you've been pushed too far..?" She asks as I look at her and answer, "I... don't know, do you?" She nodded and sighed as she brushed her hair then got some water and drank it.

"Then.." She grabbed me then moved me to a more secluded area and nlw looked more agitated, frustrated and sleep-deprived.

"Then let me show you how much I hate myself. I haven't tried harming myself, but it would feel.. intense but.. exhilarating yes? Hate. It's a strong word yes? Shows me how much self-loathing I've built. The only thing I could think of is HOW STUPID OF ME TO BELIEVE IN OTHER PEOPLE. How.. naive. When, I should believe in myself. Look where that got me. LOOK AT IT." She slightly shows signs of bruising just below her neck, then shows off slight cuts at her lower abdomen.

"Tell me how much hope you can lose before you break? Tell me how much fake masking you can do until you decide to do what's the only thing keeping you from not existing.. Your self-hatred of cowardice." She said, our faces intensely close, she is almost pressing me to a wall, while she still looks angry and desperate.

"Rika..! You're getting too close for comfort.. I'll.. help, just not like this.." I say, before she chuckled before pulling back. "Why would I expect help when this is how I treat people? Even my best friend..?" She said to herself, with a bitter smile.

"Huh..? A—at least you reach out.. By reaching out to me.. at least, you can—" I am cut off by a sudden lurch of her towards me, her hands about to touch me before she turned away and looked away, heavily breathing, her hair now more tangled.

"Haha.. haha...." She laughs while she grabs her phone. "Hard work will pay off..? Huh, what a shame your stupid quote doesn't work out in reality." She closes it then turns to me. "Yeah, I want to be successful, sure. But, not like this. I'm.. not just some random girl to be a cog in the machine. But, I am sure you don't care either way. Die in the system, or be cursed out into the unknown of life, maybe you'll find your success in the annals of history, or not and just die. Your choice." She responds to an unknown person.

"Isn't this the messages from the stage during the usual monday school ceremony earlier..? What.. made you save them?" I asked, as she smiled. "Cycle.. Cycle..! Yeah. I remember that. Wasting time?! Wasting time..! I would rather die than continue to live like this. But, I can't. A coward's way out. Suck it up and live in a jar." She said, somewhat to me and to the unknown person.

"What is.. wrong with me.. Why do I think, I think.." She says as she grabs her phone and plays, 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' by Nirvana while she grabs some water to drink, completely ignoring me. I understood what she wanted by this and so stepped away and sat close enough to where I can see her, but not too close.

After a while, she stopped at the last 'What is wrong with me?' from the song then stood up and walked to her guitar she brought to the park we were staying at, and looked at me like she wanted to make me follow, so I did. We went to her house, and entered, her parents were out until the night, and this was right around 16:00, so we just sat at her living room and she brought out the guitar then after a few adjustments and tuning, she started to play the guitar cover of 'You Know You're Right' by Nirvana, while singing the lyrics with her phone slowly scrolling it nearby, while I listened.

As she sang the song, I felt quite relieved but worried at the same time, she even hit the notes perfectly, at least in her voice, I can see her tears start to form. But what stood out from me is she changed all the references to a 'she' to a 'he' in her cover of it, afterwards she turned off the guitar and just started crying right there, in front of me, while grabbing a handkerchief and covering her face from me. I silently patted her back as she did it, before she hugged me, and I hugged her.

## You Know You're Right

## Author's Note:

The title means exactly what it means.

Oh boy, this one was interesting to write. Let's just say very deep and heavy topic of self harm will come up.

— jmb~

"Hey..." She said, as she was looking off to the distance of our school balcony. "Yeah? Got anything to share today?" I asked, as she chuckled and turned to me, with an eerie smile. "I got just the thing." She said before suddenly taking a razorblade and using it on her lower neck area. I try to stop her but she pushes me away and gets a small cut, she then wipes the blood using a yellow handkerchief then she pressed on her wound using her hand as I went to pull her away.

"Stop. Stop. I need to do this." She says as we fight over her wound, she gets increasingly rough to match my adrenaline pumping moves to prevent her from hurting herself. "No! I won't." I continue to try and stop her, as she is visibly tearing up due to how much she's pressing on the wound while also trying to push me away. "Please..!!" She manages to shove me back as she spreads her blood nearby the wound accidentally, while she gets her handkerchief to dry off her tears.

"Rika..?" I ask, as she quivers while crying into her blood stained handkerchief, while the wound is now somewhat good now, it's still scarred, but now it's starting to heal. "Get away from me, now!" She said, turning back in shame.

"I can't.. go. I need you to be safe, Rika." I say, as we notice a teacher walking by and I quickly hid her and acted like we were about to kiss, to hide her pretty obvious wound. She tensed up, but she didn't make a move as she knew doing anything would be more.. concerning.

The teacher noticed us and he nodded to me as he passed through, we both pushed each other back as I looked at her and had a faint blush while hovering around her wound a bit.

"W—what..! I.. stop.. why.." Rika turned away as I slowly approached her. "What did you do..?" She says, trembling.

"It was to shield you. I know you don't want anyone else to know." I say, as she looks at me with tired eyes, before stepping back from me again, shaking her head a ton as she hid the razorblade and handkerchief back.

"I—I'm leaving." She says turning to run but I grab her shoulder. "No. Not until your promise me not to hurt yourself anymore." I say, with a serious face.

"Please.." She tries to wrestle me away but I remain steadfast. "Promise me. I don't want to see you hurt. Even by yourself." I say, as she shakes her head. "Yes.. yes..! Okay! Fine..! You're right. I should.. I shouldn't do.. this. You know you're right.." She says as she starts shaking more while keeping her head down.

Silence fills the hallway as a fellow student, a friend of ours was walking when she saw us and quickly rushed to us, noticing Rika's crying. "Kari..?" Rika says while I look at her, with a bit of a worried face.

"Rika..? Mizo..? What happened here..?" She asks, while I contemplate.

"Kari... I.. uh.." Rika shoves me in hopes to make me answer instead. "Huh..? Hey..! It's.. this is your issue. I'm not—" She looked up at me and did her best puppy eyes face as Kari looks on in confusion. "Fine. But, don't expect anything.. okay..?" I say more gently.

"What..? One moment Rika was crying her heart out, now she's just.. I don't know.. begging? clinging?" Kari says as Rika turns away, likely in shame. "I don't know. Okay..?" I composed myself, before I tried explaining what happened.

"Okay.. so.. Rika here... decided to.." I look at Rika, now shaking a bit as she is clearly listening but is still looking away. "...harm herself. Luckily, I stopped her before the bleeding got worse. Then we.. umm.. well, faced together when a teacher was going around and the best thing I thought would be to position her to a kiss. Obviously, we wouldn't, and didn't. Trust me on this one." I explain, as Kari gets progressively more concerned, while Rika held her arms around herself and was clearly trembling.

"So.. she.. wow." Kari says, while she looks like she's thinking while Rika turns around and hugs Mizo tightly. "Hey..!! Hey..?" I say, as I see her eyes about to burst with tears while her mouth was being forced closed while she held on to me tightly.

"Mizo..? Are you sure you two are just.. best friends..?" Kari asks, as I shake my head. "I don't know. But, what matters more is her safety. She.. she needs help. I just don't know if she can get one." I say, as Rika tightened further and started digging her nails into my polo. "I understand.. I just.. Okay, I knew she was going through a lot, didn't speak to me, and.. well.." Kari looks at Rika's disentangled and messy hair covering her back uniform. "She never does this. The self harm part I mean. We all have our own problems.." I respond as Kari nods and pats Rika's back as she stiffens and Kari instantly pulls back.

"Um.. Okay, this.. I.. was not prepared for this. Um, I have to go now though. See you, you two." Kari says and waves at us before leaving. As soon as Kari leaves, Rika instantly pulls back from the hug and with intense shaking. "T—thank you." She says as she grabs her things. "I.. promise. I just need some time alone. Do.. do you trust me.. no. Will you trust me again..?" She asked, as she looked at me with unintentionally desperate and needy eyes. A long silence followed, I needed to make sure what I say won't make her situation worse.

"Forget about it. I know you'll just say 'No'. I'm still going. It's going to be night." She says, before getting her things and leaving alone. "I.. wait..!" I called out, but she ignored me and continued to walk, I considered catching up but I stopped myself as she disappeared around a corner, leaving me alone.

## Chained Soul

## Author's Note:

"Let you live alone, in the world you have in place."

"You live your life like it's so easy and there's no meaning, but you don't know it's the calm before the storm. So, I play along."

"Do you want to know what.. my life has been.. Mizo..? Let me show you." She said, before she dragged me to her bedroom. It has a distinct pink and black contrast, her books and computer being mostly silver and charcoal black while her room and bed was with pastel pink and purple. "I don't.. want to wait for tomorrow." She says as she enables the laptop to start booting up, while she sits down at a barely functional swivel chair. I also noticed that her red floor was collapsing and had concrete showing. "I don't want to take it to the limit.. 'cause I'm already in it.. I can't make it better.. I.." She shuddered before she jumped to her bed. "..**surrender**."

I am trying to process what she's saying when her laptop finished booting and she immediately sprung up and went to it. I saw that she went to her documents, then recordings. "I don't record. This is.. more of a diary." She says as she clicks on one titled 'AKAHSHHSJHWWJWBWKSJEBDB'. "That's quite a long.. name." I commented before the markdown text file loaded. Here is the contents;

> GIVE ME LIFE GIVE ME GOOD GIVE ME SOMETHING FROM ABOVE
I AM PRAYING FOR ABOVE TO INTERVENE
I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE
BUT WHEN THE DARKNESS SETS IN
LIGHT SEEPS THROUGH LIKE A CURSE
URGING ME TO BE FREE OF MY SHACKLES
WHEN I AM HELPLESSLY ALONE
YOU APPEAR.
WHEN I AM TIRED OF YOU
YOU APPEAR.
I'M STUCK SEARCHING FOR SEARCHING 
GASPING FOR WATER AND AIR
I CAN'T FEEL YOU
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE OKAY 
DON'T SAVE ME DON'T TRY TODAY
YOU'LL END UP LIKE THE MANY PEOPLE THAT'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT AND LOST
I'M BURNING BRIGHT WHILE MY COLD CHAINS RESTRAIN ME
TELL ME O SILENT VOICE
WILL MY SALVATION COME?
OR WILL I BE RESIGNED TO MY FATE
TO HATE MYSELF?
LOSE IT.

She looked at it absent mindedly, like she was processing what she was doing when she wrote the note down. "This is.. when..?" She looked at the file's details, it was just three days ago, on a monday. Middle of the night, 3:00. "Oh god." She says as she sits down in a chair swiveling it around as I try to come up with words to say.

"What.." She repeated to herself, while she further made her rotation quicker while holding her head. "I.." Rika looks at me and jumps at me and faints, landing in my body very awkwardly.

"Rika..! Rika..?" I called out, but she was completely out, her face was relaxed now and almost seemingly put her weight on mine. I gently patted her head and slowly carried her to her bed nearby. "I.. don't know if you need medical.. assistance.. I just hope you feel better, okay?" I say to her unconscious self before leaving the room quietly, not before turning off her laptop and lights.

## Love Buzz

## Author's Note:

Taking a small break from the heavy emotions of these 'chapters' to pivot to more heavy emotions [this time can you guess..? ;) ] that are less.. into the depths of the abyss of people's worst emotions and turmoil. I can never complete the long ones so this short one is a lil' treat.. :D

"Come on..! You're taking your time, huh?!" She says as I calmly mop the floor of our classroom. "Shut up, you're not even an assigned cleaner today, and you think you can do better, _woman?"_ I retorted before she threatened to dirty the undried floor I just mopped. "Hey..! Stop.. no..!" I warn as she held her tongue at me. "Behh..! Tu madre es una puta tonto! Como tu!" She says, before I stared into her eyes. "Tu canto es.. tan bueno como.. las uñas en.. la pizarra..!" I say, as she directly steps over the floor to get closer to me.

"Young lady, I cannot—" I say in a formal tone before she pushes me to the wall behind me. "What? Where'd that voice go huh?! That bravado.. **show me."** She said, our bodies are very close, but not touching. "You know, if we stay like this, I might just get.. tempted." I say before I wink, and as she processed what I said, another random student that left her bags appeared on the door and opened it, seeing us very close.

"O—oh..! S—sorry..! Am I interrupting something..?" The student asks, as I look at Rika, the girl very close in front of me. "W—what?! No..! No!! You are not. I.." said Rika, she's the girl in front of me is clearly blushing as she moves away from the classroom and goes outside. "Don't.. um.. say anything about that.. okay..?" I ask the student as she smiles and nods. "Oh don't worry, Mizo. My lips are sealed tight. Though, I am not surprised.. do you two have a bond beyond.. friendship?" July (that's her name) asks, as I awkwardly laughed and looked away. 

"Um.. it's not that.. far. Just, umm.. we haven't figured that out yet." I answered, as July got her bags and moved closer. "Well, you better do.. Valentine's coming up after the exam and mid oral defense, if any deadline is to be thought of.. that's what I would say." July moves closer, with a friendly smile. "Why do you know..? Do **you** have a plan for February 14?" I ask as she turns away from me, likely hiding her blush. "I.. have a plan. But, but.. honestly, I'm more interested in you two, see how you develop.." She admits as I turn to face her back. 

"Really..? Your love life is not working out..?" I responded before she chuckled and turned back to me. "Well.. I'd say no. But.. it's been a struggle finding the perfect.. partner." She admits, turning to a more reflective tone. "Well.. yeah." Before I could say anything Rika went back inside and looked at me with a playful annoyance. "Are you still not done?! Talking to girls before you even finish your mopping.." She condemns as July laughs. "I better go now. See you in class tomorrow..!" She says before waving us goodbye.

"What..? Getting jealous are we.." I tease as she glares at me and crosses her arms. "Just finish the damn mopping, Mizo.." Rika then watched me complete my mopping while I had one earbud on to listen to grunge music while I kept my ears ready for anything from her. Although, she kept opening her mouth to say something, then not following through. Until she sighed then asked, "W—what are you listening.. to..?" 

"Nirvana. Specifically, all of Bleach: Deluxe Edition on my phone. Currently, it's.. Floyd the Barber that's playing. The studio version. You're a Nirvana super fan, you should know." I answer as her eyes lighten up. "No way..! Um.. you listen to.. haha.. right.. Um, what's your favorite song on Bleach, the studio recordings..? Mine is Downer." She asks as I smile and look at her intensely. "About A Girl." 

She immediately got what I was getting at and blushed intensely. "Sh—shut.. really..? That's.. wow.. yeah.. I guess it's a popular one, not really my thing.. For me, even Paper Cuts and Sifting are more.. to my liking." I smile and turn to mop more. "Meh, I haven't grown to like them. What, is Big Cheese in your top five?" I ask, as I turn to face her, she surprisingly nodded. "Y—yeah. Downer, Scoff, Blew, Negative Creep and.. Big Cheese. My top five." she elaborated.

"Wow.. I guess you must hate Smells Like Teen Spirit?" I ask, knowing of a few common tropes when being a Nirvana fan. "O—oh..! Well, it's not that it isn't a good song.. It's just not my favorite in it.. 'Drain You' is my favorite there, in the Nevermind album." She responded as I smiled and finished mopping and then as I was about to throw out the dirty water used, I looked at her, and we were both near the classroom door very close, I said, "Maybe I'd consider.. being that.. you in that song.." before quickly running away.

She was intensely blushing, but she ran after me, calling out; "H—hey..! Stop flirting, you.. incessant worm..!" She caught up with me when I arrived at a utility area. "Hey..! Hey..!" She calls me, while I am panting from exhaustion as I throw the dirty water away. "What.. what's gotten into you..! I.. you know how I feel about this.. Oh, how I long to punch you straight at your manhood.." She continued, while trying to calm herself down.

"Hey.. it's just a bit of teasing, hmm?" I say, as she calms down and looks worried. "I—I get that. But, oh I don't know.. with the blatant ways you flirt with me.. Mizo." She stopped herself as I finished the utility cleaning and looked at her, more seriously. "Are you worried that this.. friendship is more than that..?" I ask, as she hesitates to answer before nodding. "Yeah. Something like that. I.. just.. think I'm not.. fit for you, as a girlfriend.. There's no.. well, it's like siblings, you get me..? I'm grateful for you, and with our bond, it's just. the whole romance and sex thing isn't.. what I want for us." She explained, putting her hands to her chest, near her heart.

I contemplate her words, as I nod. "I get it. I'm used to teasing you about it, but.. never considered if you were.. well, also confused about it like I am. I mean, if someone were to flirt with me like I did to you, I would blush too, y'know." I say as we slowly walked back to our classroom. "So.. are those.." She trails off as I nod. "Yeah, I.. well, wanted to rouse you up more than you do to me. I figured it would be.. well, no I wasn't thinking." I stumbled on my words before we silently continued.

We made it to the room, then we silently cleaned up then locked the room for the night. 

"So.. are we still.." I ask, as she nods. "Yeah? Yeah! We're still going to eat dinner in that fast food restaurant I told you about. Come on, hurry up..!" She responds, before dragging me with her, to run to the super mall nearby.

## Researching Research

Thinkin' of a day that I'll finally break free from my chains and write the best adventure novel, anyways let's see.

Unresolved Issues?! Wow.

"Hey. Mizo, what's.. what's on your mind..?" said Rika, as she looked at me staring at my laptop screen with a somewhat unfinished draft of a manuscript of a school research project. "I.. can't.. describe it, it's.. like, you know, so overwhelming.,, just thinking about it." I said, as I fell over to the nearby bed, looking stumped and conflicted. "Um.. Lemme look at this, while I'm not a writer, I should just get a general idea for what your group has been writing.." She continued, before reading the manuscript, silently doing so as she scrolls through it. "Hey.. Mizo..?" She asked again, looking at me holding up a pillow in front of my head.

"What.. I.. just.." I mumbled some incoherent words before stopping. "Hey.. Mizo.." She said, standing up and trying to go near me. I quickly tighten my hold on the pillow while turning away. "Leave." I managed to blurt out, before silently crying. "L—leave..? That's not what we do, Mizo. I.. don't think I need to say what you have told me as well." She responded, as I remained silent, taking off my glasses and wiping my tears away. "Mizo.." She said, getting closer to me, but still hesitant to touch me.

"Go away, Rika. From.. the bottom of my sensitive heart, **leave**." I say, my strained tone makes it obvious now to what I was hiding from her. "I'll just.. close the laptop, gotta buy a new battery, hehe.." She said, awkwardly shuffling away and turning off the laptop, before audibly sighing and walking away from my room.

I compose myself, then I remove the pillow from me and look at the blank laptop screen with anguish that I can't describe. I sighed too, then turned to where Rika likely went through, the door of my room. "I'm sorry, so much.. But, while I know that my.. reaction was justified, it isn't.. excusable." I told myself, before she suddenly appeared with a neutral expression. "Hey, I got us some food." She said, while staring at me.

"Oh..? Yeah, okay.. What is it..?" I asked, as I got up and approached her. "It's a surprise, pal~" She smiled then dragged me to my kitchen table while covering my eyes. "Surprise..! Not really, though.. haha~!" She says, as she shows me two plates with rice and fried chicken, both have gravy sauce beside them and two drinks of soda about a large size for both of them. "Wow.. where did you order this, huh?" I asked as she looked away from me with a smile and answered, "Just.. delivery service. Thought it would be nice to grab some fast food for today."

"Fast food..? What, you can't co—" I say before a slap on my arm stopped me from finishing. "I can..! Shut up. What, desperate for my cooking or something?" She retorted while I chuckled and said, "Maybe a little, but I suppose this order would do. It's a better chance of eating not burned food, haha.." I say, as she slaps me again in response. "Shut up..! I swear, it's only fun when you're the one being teased.." She says, as she is slightly smiling. "Well, don't throw rocks when living in a glass house~" I say, as she slaps me for the third time. 

"Oh yeah, how about a machine gun huh?" She retorted with spite before I dragged her to her seat and responded, "Suppose I get it, you'd always want a weapon that can backfire." I said, as she wrestled my hands away and looked away, heavily blushing. "Just eat." She says, and I nod and sit down. I start eating the food and when she notices she starts eating too, looking like she forgot what we were doing just moments ago.

"Okay, okay. Aside from that.. I.. uh, got a few comments on your manu—" She cut herself off, as she shook her head. "Oh.. right. I'm sorry.. for bringing it up if it's so.. um.. traumatic..? For you.. I realize—" She said before I cut her off. "Hold it. I shouldn't make you.. **apologize**." I say before she cut me off. "Hey..! I get it, Mizo.. You don't have to be hard on yourself, I did something I didn't realize—" She said before I cut her off. "No, no.. You wouldn't have realized. Why would you..?" I say, as her breath shuddered.

"I still didn't ask.. if you were still.. comfortable talking about it. For that, I'm **sorry**." She says as I shook my head and held her hand. "**Please**. I.. none.. you.. you don't have.. to. Okay..?" I say, as I held her hand tightly. She tried to say something, but she stuttered before she stopped and she nodded.

"I am.. not.. this.. emotional, really.. but like.. I.. it just brought up bad memories. It's.. so..  confusing.. yet, I can't help.. help but feel a sense of.. dread. I'm.. going to my room. You have the couch and kitchen to yourself. Go to me if you want to sleep, after.. fifteen minutes." I say, finishing my food and putting it on the sink and leaving, leaving her to process what just happened.

## Get Me?

## Author's Note:

Once again, a new chapter of Rika and Mizo is upon us, while I haven't forgotten about Mijo and DeltaRambles Main, using this as a side-project is good for my mental health, as it allows me to explore more grounded topics, without the complexity of fitting into the magical lore, I'll probably still do the 'vent' spinoffs, I've just run out of ideas to do them differently and creatively.

"You two are going to have to dance together, you two are right around the same height, Mizo's taller, but you're also the tallest girl here, Rika.. So, you're with him. He can't just stand around and do nothing for the transition of the scene, so he'll have to pair with you, only for that moment though, he'll just join the others in the dance choreo for the last part." said July to us, as Riza is immediately shaking her head. "M—Mizo..! No way, no fucking way. Pair me with anyone else but him. Please..!" She asks, but July smiles and responds, "What..? It's just for a moment, and I'm sure your friendship will survive this, and I don't think anybody else can pair with him that isn't awkward either." 

Rika tries to respond, but July is taken away by our other group mates as she turns to me. "What..? Bro, I don't.. I don't.. Um, I'm sorry.. but, I **don't** want to dance with you, not that I take you as a disgusting incel, but rather I really don't want to dance with my male best friend. Especially if it's going to be seen by the entire class batch." She says to me as I nod and shrug my shoulder, before I respond, "Welp, nothing we can do about it, really.. You're just going to have to accept it, and the **fallout** from it."

"The **fallout...**" She trails off, as July turns around and says to Rika, "Hey, so.. there's really not much I can do, Mizo is idle anyway after his scene, and since.. everyone will be dancing in the end scene, we'd need to transition nicely, and by having you and him be the second boy to girl pair, makes the acting more easier to do since the song's about a straight girl's hopeless romanticism anyway." July then turns to the main lead and speaks to her, while Riza turns to me, looking a bit agitated.

"Mother— damn it. You've seen the others. Let's just practice the damn thing. But, no touching." She says, as I offer my hand. "Then, let's start." I say, as she hesitantly holds out her hand, then starts practicing the dance choreo. At first, we were both messing up in different places, but we got it down to a T. After we were observed and approved by July that our dance choreo was good, she announced, "Break time na..! Just come back here after 30 minutes..!" We instantly separated, as Rika goes to her water tumbler and drinks it.

"Hey, Mizo.. Can I borrow your alcohol? (isopropyl rubbing) Not that I.. um.. you get it..?" She asks, as I act all surprised and get my little rubbing alcohol and give it to her. She quietly uses it, while looking down at her hands, then gives it to me with her head still down. "A—anyways.. What.. how's the progress in that 'poema español' we have to memorize..?" She asks, as she gains the courage to look at me, and I answer, "I haven't started.. It's far off anyway, and there's the whole exam and research defense we gotta do, you know my situation.. Not ideal to add on that burden, **yet**.."

"Oh, I was just.. thinking about it. Profesora de español was talking about it earlier, on how every friday is our time to do it, but I falter on actually doing it and instead just play Techmino.. (tetris inspired game)" She says, as I nod and respond, "Yep. I've tried to, but I realize how pointless it is to do it, when I'd probably forget about it after that friday.. I just use it to write my novel." I say, as she chuckles. "I've checked your website, you don't even update **that** frequently. So I don't know where that time goes." She responds, as I smile and look at my phone, then I say, "I admit, I usually tire out during the night.. and long chapters and spinoffs don't just.. finish in one night."

She looks at me, then looks away as she asks, "Do you think I'd fit being a lesbian..?" I am quite surprised by the tonal shift, but I choose my words carefully; "Well.. are you?" She shrugs her shoulders and answers, "I **don't** know. I'm just.. asking you." I respond with; "Well, you'd better ask an actual girl, and a lesbian at that than me, but—" She quickly looks at me and says, "But..! I only ask you this, I know what I'm doing, Mizo.." She tried to say something after that, but she shut herself up. "I.. uh.. well, ahem. I'll say.. yeah. But..! Don't take that personally.."

She shakes her head and responds; "It's fine, I asked the question. But.." She looks at me, and manages to form a small smile. "I'm grateful for your honesty." She looks away, then leaves.

## Hidden and Seen

## Author's Note:

So, looking for a crossover chapter? Here it is..! The canonical reason for the whole main series is it's like Mijo's novel he's writing based on his adventures, so he doesn't notice that Mizo and Rika beside him in this chapter are also kinda important (in my world), so he doesn't write about it. 

At least, that's my reason to not write about them during Mijo's journey, but from this point on, I'll probably reference them, but they're still unimportant, and most likely, not going to be involved with the dark world.

My only one rule for writing these series of chapters for Mizo and Rika is that they don't ever go into the dark world, and with that, shatter the whole point of a more slice-of-life grounded story.

"So.. like do you not get it?" She asks, as I scratch my head and nod. "No.. why would you be wasting your time learning español outside of class..?" I say, before putting my hands up, then continuing, 'I'm not saying you should stop, I'd just think if you're not going to spain or latin america for another seven years.. You'd probably be better off starting with like.. a language you could practice in-person.. Maybe refine that tagalog speak we struggle with..?" I say, as she shakes her head. "W—what do you mean..?! A trilingual alpha chad woman like me would never struggle with Filipino..!" She says, as she has a faint smile.

We accidentally bumped into another guy, and he apologized before moving away, he seemed to be in a hurry though, he looked like he was from our batch, but I couldn't get a good look before he left, only that he carried a black sling bag. "Rika, you know who that guy is?" I asked, as she tried hard to recall him. "Mijo..? I think.. He's like just a rando from 10-Dalton I met I kept seeing when at Waltermart.. I learned his name through an old friend.." 

"Oh okay.. then.." I said, as we continued our way, but then we met Rhida, a somewhat popular student among us due to her membership in the journalism club, that I joined. "Umm.. Mizo, have you seen Mi-m— I mean, Mijo.. anywhere?" She asks, as I nod and points in the direction of Mijo's general direction. "Thanks.!" Rhida leaves hurriedly too.

"Ummm.." I say, before seeing in the corner of my eye, a research partner of mine, clearly doing an experiment without my knowledge. "Hey, Mizo, isn't that your research partner..?" Rika asks, as I do a double-take and sure enough, she's the one. "What..!! They didn't.. didn't.." I tense up, as I remember the dreadful memories that are associated with that project. "Oh.. you..." She looks to her left and sees someone that made her make me turn away from my original group mate. "W—what..?" I ask, as she starts pushing me to run and so I go with her.

"Nothing..! Keep running!" She whispers to me, as we run to a secluded area. "Huh?" I asked again, as she turned to me seriously with her hands on my shoulders. "Are you okay?" She asks, as I nod and respond, "Um.. yeah, I think so?" She slapped me playfully and asked me again, "You froze up, Mizo.. and.. I just.. don't want you to keep getting hurt... When I'm around, tell me the.. truth.. okay..?" She looks at me, before pulling away. I didn't know what to say, she was right. "Good, now.. let's just.. enjoy this afternoon first." She grabs me and we go to other areas.

## Start the Fire 

## Author's Note:

Originally was an idea about how the characters would react with a theoretical sex change but progressed into something more, so here it is.

"I wonder if we'll be friends if we switched genders..?" She asks, as I jump from my phone and look at her. "Um.. I don't know. Hey! I have an idea." I go near her and show her an AI chat bot. "Let's see what it thinks." I input our personalities and some general info. "Hey..! Why do you have me written as a tsundere?!" She narrowed her eyes as I smiled and answered, "Because you are—" She slaps me and takes my phone and changes a few things, I can't figure out. "Hey, what did you—" I stopped myself as she sent the message.

We read the message, and I feel a bit interested in what the AI had to say, but Riza answered first. "I.. um.. you know, I always wondered what it'll be like to.. have the.. you know.." Riza gestures to my crotch. "Well, it'd probably be better to have one..? Yeah, because you don't have to pee sitting down, yea?" I say as she nods heavily. "Such a hassle.. having to clean too..? And periods.. fucking periods.. I HATE THEM!!" She has an understandable reaction as I calm her down. 

"They require me to buy pads, tampons every two weeks, and apply them every or so week.. Damn it!! Why does the uterus want to produce a baby that will not exist?! Can't... like it just start to work if it detects.. male liquids inside..?" ranted Rika, as I replied with, "Unfortunately, my dear **girl— friend..** You live in a society. We haven't developed human body modification yet." 

"Why did you say.. **girlfriend** like that!?" She exclaimed as she tugged on my shoulders. "What? You're a girl, and you're my friend.." I respond, as she slaps me. "MIZO! YOU DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. I swear.." She interrupts, as I smile and look away, knowing she's blushing intensely. "Fine fine.." I responded, as Rika made me turn back to her, her face clearly blushing intensely. "Just.. ugh. You see this face? This face is of a woman responding to your incessant teases." She says with a kinda annoyed tone, as I smile slyly. "Yeah, I can see that, dummy." I pull away from her, as we both calm down from that close encounter.

"Let's move on.. before you kiss me and I retaliate with a neck snap." She said, with a hint of sarcasm. "Fine.. If it makes you feel better, at least you don't get boners..?" I say, as she chuckled a bit, looking at me with a faint smile. "You think getting a hard on is worse than a period? Really feminist of you, Mizo~" She says, as I retort with, "Fine..! What about circumcision?" She laughs more and pulls me closer, "One time thing. Imagine, you grow your foreskin back every month, and you have to re-experience that whole thing again, without anesthesia, over the course of twenty one days _slowly_." She made her point proven with a finger on my chest as I raised my hands up in surrender. 

"Okay, fine. I've exhausted my talking points anyway, let's move on from the crotch part before one of us thinks differently of the other." I say, as she looks at me in my eyes, unamused. "Oh please, Mizo.. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how more horny you are..?" I relent again, my hands moving to her hair on her shoulders. "No need. But you sound like you wanna know for real?" I respond, as Rika blushes and pushes me away. "Stop..! Okay, okay.. Why don't we actually talk about what we were talking about and not.. embarrass each other with intense romantic flirting tension for half an hour..?" She comments as I nod and pull back, starting to feel that heat again.

"Fuck... dude.." She says, as she trembles and shudders. "We might have taken this too far.." I responded as she nodded, adding "Yeah.. I'm.. I'm going to just leave.. Every time I stay here.. I get a little.. bit.. more heated." She stands up and looks at me, before walking to her room. I calm myself down too, my brain is overwhelmed and I'm starting to feel sleepy. I'm lost in the hazy thoughts of Rika as I put my phone down and lay down on the couch.

"Riza.. Riza..? Rika.." I'm confused on what I'm thinking as my brain flashed with a hundred sexual encounters, all leading up to the whole climax of it all. "Maybe.. should.. sleep.." I say as I drift off unconsciously.

## Come on Over

## Author's Note:

That's.. a natural progression of intense emotion burnout. I don't know where I got it but yeah. Anyway, see the aftermath. Cause' I'm seeing what these things do. Oh, by the way. My chapters aren't in order, but I'll rearrange them once

*A call is ringing, the usual one.*

"Mizo..? You coming to my house tonight?"

"No.. I'm sorry, Rika.. I'm.. busy. See you tomorrow though."

"Oh. Then... see you."

*Call hangs up*

I sighed as I put down my phone, and said to myself, "I.. am not really busy, Rika. I just.. can't see you." I lay down on my bed, the bed feeling tempting to sleep into but, the war raging in my head was too much. "Consequences, caught up to me.. I'm tired, exhausted, and worst of all, unable to face you, Rika." I roll on my bed, as I try to calm myself, but I snapped and punched a pillow so hard that it deflated. "What.." I step back, feeling the rage start to dissipate, my hand hurting.

"God damnit." I cursed, as I fell to bed again. I felt a sense of urgency to move to my room next door that had my school stuff but every walk feels painful, and sometimes I would lose control and smack my body to a nearby cabinet, lamp, door, wall and anywhere. But after a lot of struggling, I finally managed to open my door, but I collapsed on the floor before I started crawling to my other room, quite a few walks away.

"Just.. a few.." I managed to crawl to my other room, and open the door, only to collapse right after, this time, for good as I was completely knocked out.

*Switching perspectives..*

"If he's busy.. he makes time.. I mean, he did that comic in my house.. So, why is Mizo.. denying..?" asked Riza to herself, as she looks at the contact photo of Mizo, taken during the christmas break. He looked happy as he was sticking his tongue out on the camera. "Mocking piece of SHIT!!" Riza impulsively punched her phone, not breaking it, but it did shock her as she quickly pulled back so much she hit her head on a shelf on the wall behind herm "Ow!!" She turned to punch the shelf but quickly redirected it to herself, knocking her down to the bed, being spread out.

"I.. shit. Fuck! I need him.. wait. No, I don't!" said Riza, before she sat up and grabbed her phone. "Fuck it. He's not here.. I don't want to do shit, I'm just.." Rika opens her mobile browser and puts it on incognito. "Rule34 Yuri.. please distract me.." continued Rika, as she grabs a body pillow and blanket. "Everything feels so cold.." murmured Rika, as she waited for the page to load.

## Do the Twist

## Author's Note:

Inspired by two people that often fight (let's just say Ikari-fly is the codeword) + an idea popped into my head when writing while listening to music.

"The.. guitarist..? lead vocalist..? Ehe~ Obviously I'm the obvious pick." Rika says to me as we are outside of an instrument shop inside a supermall. "Nah. I fit better. You can't even sound like him, much less metal screams well. You sound like me out of breath." I say to her, as she slaps me playfully. "Hey! I'm not that bad.. But.. who's playing drums?" She asks, as we look at a drum set inside the store. "Ah shit." I say, as she turns to me slyly. "And who's the drum set owner here...? Mizo! **THAT'S YOU!!!!"** 

"Ah. Fine. But I get backing vocals too." I say as Rika shuffles around then bothers me. "What song are we doing? Have you got any lyrics we can jam to?" asked Rika to me as I shook my head. "Nope. Fuck it.. Let's cover Nevermind by Nirvana. Including Endless, Nameless." I answered, as she nodded. "I knew it. Personally, I would've done Bleach, but whatever, nevermind." added Riza, as I made her look at me. I was smiling quite a bit, she was at first confused, but slowly smiled as she leaned closer. "Don't _fucking_ do this ever **again**, bastard..." She whispered, our faces very close before she pulled back.

"Anyways!! Let's move on. Um, you need any replacements? I don't think I need any.." said Rika as I shook my head. "Nah. I have enough drum sticks to turn into drumsticks!" Rika looks at me confused, but moves on. "Riight.." She is silent for a bit before not moving on and asking, "Wait, why would you want drum sticks to be drumsticks? Like the edible.. um.. no, the chicken thing you can eat. Not the wooden sticks used for drumming."

"Oh, come on, Rika. It's called a metaphor, like how you play guitar like you are having an aneurysm." I say, as Rika slaps me. "Shut up. Don't use it like that **everrr**..!" She responds before sighing, and turning to face away. "Anyway, let's go buy some food, maybe have a.
 have a.. oh no." Rika looked at me all worried. "OUR FUCKING RESEARCH!!!! SHIT SHIT I GOTTA GO SEE YOU TOMORROW MIZO!" Rika turned to go away as I also look at my phone and sigh, before walking back to do our research too.

## Box-Shaped Box

## Author's Note:

"I miss the comfort in being sad, and just not being in emotional turmoil all the time. I hate how every move I do, I curse myself, and when people say what I think they'd say I'd be proven right by my own self-loathing."

That's likely what someone would say relating to this chapter; who said it? Honestly, interpret it all you want, whether it be a Rika, Mizo, or even another DeltaRambles character! Might as well include the writer, since the writer is the one writing these characters, anyways.. enjoy, if you can.

"Hey.. so.. are you okay?" I ask, as Rika is scrolling on her phone. "No. Why?" She asks, as she continues to type on her phone. "Well, I know that, but like.. I've.. I've just been seeing you spend more time on your phone. And, less on us.. you know." I say, while I grabbed some coffee from a cafe shop we went to. "Us..? Is there anything to talk about?" She asks, as she puts her phone down.

"I'm tired Mizo. I'm tired. I'm.. losing my mind. Every day I wonder why I'm still here, still in this damn school. The school is a pain. All pain. I don't know how to get out. We don't know each other. We've been like this for months. I've accepted the fact you'll have a better social life than me. You'll be relatable, and.. funny, while I wallow in my own depression, and people look at me weirdly. I'm tired of explaining myself. I'm tired of speaking like this. I just want to get through this. That's it." Rika turned back to her phone and started typing again.

"Rika.. Please, I just.. want you to be happy too. I can't help but feel you're neglecting everything in your life. Your tasks, have you done them?" I ask, I'm pretty concerned, but I see she has no intention of letting me speak any longer. "I don't care. What's the point? What's the fucking point?! Nothing. I waste time everyday doing something I enjoy, only to come back to reality, facing myself in the mirror. I waste time running to the park, playing videogames, listening to music, writing in my diary, only to figure out that all I've done is pointless. All pointless." Rika says, she is noticeably holding back tears, but she doesn't show it.

"Do you have to have a point?" I ask, as she snaps at me. "WELL CLEARLY THERE'S GOTTA BE A POINT TO MY SUFFERING?! Maybe, they'll reward me with a break, a date, any semblance of connection. But, I don't get it. My grades flounder. Inconsistent. What do I need to do? I DON'T FUCKING KNOW. And people like... my parents always have their fucking advice that I'M FOREVER IN DEBT TO AFTER FUCKING TRYING AND FAILING!" Rika immediately turns away, not letting me see her face, just the hair at the back of her head, flowing to her back.

"They eye me like an idiot, when I'm weak.. I've been locked inside that box shaped box for years.. I've been drawn into their tar pit trap.. I wish I could go away and turn back..." She sings, as I recognize the lyrics to be a modification of a Nirvana song. I don't say anything as she continues, "Hey, wait! I got a new complaint, guess I'm forever in debt to your priceless advice.. Grade-fearing people forgive no one just yet, cut myself on razors and pens.. Broken mind of 'My Highness' I'm left black. Throw down your classical noose so I can get it done.." 

She strained her voice as she sang, "Hey, wait! I got a new complaint, guess I'm forever in debt to your priceless advice.." She stays silent before turning to the table and is now typing on her phone again, clearly saddened and tired now, but she still ignores what she just sang as I tried to come up with a response.

"Did you.. make that one up on the spot or did you write about it? I.. I'm impressed. I thought I was the writer here.. haha.." I smile, as Rika chuckles a bit and says, "I wrote it. I'm not smart like you in that way, you'd probably be able to do that on the fly. Hey, at least you made me laugh. Good job." She holds a thumbs up before continuing to type on her phone.

"Um.. So, are.. what are we doing..?" I ask, as she shrugs. "I don't know, Mizo. I find that my.. uh.. what do you call it, where you like get relief after doing something that expresses the emotions?" She asks me, as I smile and put my hand on her shoulder. "Catharsis, sis." I answer, as she shakes me and says, "Ah, yeah! That. Well, I'm less.. sad, but.. I'm not going to aay I am out of it. Still.. stil.." She is barely holding her composure. "In the—"

"Thick of it, everybody knows—" I continue as she slaps me. "Stop!! Don't complete that.. that's a stupid song.." She says, with a smile, a first time for her in a while.

## Room 115

## Author's Note:

"Loneliness inside.. I wait for paradise, but it never came and I sat here paralyzed."

From Blacklite District - Be Afraid

A compilation of thoughts from my notebook into a story for someone to remember, and also reflect upon.

— jmb~

----

"Room 115.. it may be unofficial.. but that's what I call my room." Rika says as she and I (Mizo) looked at a taped piece of paper with the lettering; 'Room: 115'. "You have.. a name for your own room?" I ask, as she nods. "Mhm. It's where my guitar is so.. gotta have a name for my demos than.. 'Rika's Recordings #69'  and let it be called; 'The 2024 Room 115 Recordings' and it's also a great band name, or album name.. speaking of which, I haven't heard from you about your drum fills.. and backing vocals stuff..?"

"**Busy**. You get it, Rika." I say, as Rika sadly nodded. "I suspected.. and I suppose your research isn't done yet?" She asked, and I also sadly nodded. "Yep. Still workin' on it. After all, a big day is coming up." I respond as she sighs and sits down on her bed. "You know, I just realized how.. melancholic our life has been these past few days." Rika says, as she drinks some bottled water.

"I don't know. Maybe it's just the school atmosphere getting to us? You know, the whole... 'competitiveness' trap." I said, as Rika sadly nodded. "I hate it. I hate that fucking capitalism-inspired shit system they call 'The Philippine Education System'." She said, as I held her hand. "I get ya. With how many works they assign in these 'hell' weeks, no wonder we are exhausted, and they expect us to be fine during it..? No wonder that grade 9 killed himself.." I say, as Rika jolts in surprise.

"Wait what?! I didn't know.. thatt..." Rika commented, as I looked away in embarrassment. "Oh. Well, now you know." I say as Rika smiles. "It's nothing to be ashamed of. We're.. talking about taboo topics after all, it only makes sense.. I think." said Rika, as I looked back at her. "Yeah, okay.. we lost the plot, what are we talking about?" I ask as Rika sighs.

"The broken system. But, it's more than that. It's how everyone is either unconsciously or consciously following it without fighting it. From my perspective, people just.. do stuff, and then.. force people to do so, through the system. By, how many tasks.. many problems.. I just feel overwhelmed, and lost." Rika sighs as she lays down onto her bed. "It'll come to pass though, yes?" I comment, as she sadly nods. "Well, yeah. I'm just.. not sure if by the end, I'll make it.. well, not that I'd die, but that.. my future will be irreparably broken.." explained Rika, as I tug on her arm.

"What? What's that supposed to mean?" Rika asks me, as she holds my hand that is on her arm. "Explain yourself. You seem the type that needs hugs and kisses from your parents. I say as she slaps my arm away, with a faint blush. "W—well.. not like that!! But, yeah.. that's.." Rika looks at my eyes. "That's why you're here..!" I smirked before she continued, "OKAY! BUT NOT THAT WAY! jeez.." Rika is now intensely blushing as she looks away. 

"You seem so adamant about it.. but I digress. Go on with your venting before you get distracted by your confusing feelings for me." I replied as Rika's breath hitched and she tightened her hold on my hand. "S—stop teasing.. Ugh..!" Rika turns to me as she sits up. "Whew.. I **almost** lost what I was trying to say.." Rika loosens her hold on me as she composed herself.

"I—It's just.. I'm so.. guilty of always being either the group member who's doin' nothin' or being assigned a menial task..! Like.. 'oh you didn't contribute any meaningful stuff, that means you get a deduction..!' I.. hate myself, for not being honest with everyone, including you.. just.. to.. pass.. this damn fucking grade.."  said Rika as tears swelled up, I also felt a bit of hurt by hearing her talk, I had similar problems too. "I don't.. get it.. I can't.. I can't just be happy with how I organize myself. With how I defend myself. Everytime.. I try to speak out.. I feel so guilty.. then.. then.. I go back home and cry to myself." Rika starts crying as she buries her head on my chest.

"I— I get it.. Rika, I don't even speak about my own problems.. You're.. better at that regard.. At least.. well, you can speak out, and.. that's a start." I say, keeping myself from breaking down in front of her. "I.. just.. feel it would be better if I followed them.. but.. I don't know.. would it make me more.. happier..? But, I look at you.." said Rika, as she looked at my eyes. "And I see exhaustion etched into those black eyes with heavy eye bags.. I.. I think I'm just forced to be like this.." Rika continued as she hugged me tightly.

"It's okay.. Mizo.. you can cry too.." She continued, as the surprise made tears fall from my eyes. Silence took over as we hugged tightly before she pulled back and gave me my handkerchief to dry my tears out. She then gave me a pillow to reflect upon her words, as she laid down on her bed too. 

The electric fan's noise buzzed through our ears, while the aircon's hums barely went through our hearing. But, eventually, after a while, Rika spoke up. "This doesn't solve anything.. I don't think anything we two can do will be impactful in the grand scheme of things.  Pain will continue, the workload abusive.. and the journey will be harsh with many tears of trauma.. I.. I'm lucky to have you, and hopefully.. hopefully in that distant future.. I can jam with you on the stages, and have fun on the dance floor." Rika smirked before we hugged again, and then pulled back.

"Hopefully.. and.. I promise, Rika. I'll fight. We'll fight. Not only for ourselves, but to break this **fucking** system to pieces." I said to her as we shook hands and moved to talk about other stuff.

## Hey, Pain

## Author's Note:

Born out of contempt and anguish

— jmb~ | 12:07 | Feb 5, 2025

----

"Uh.. hey you feeling okay?" messaged Mizo to Rika, as he noticed she wasn't anywhere to be found at school. After a tense minute, Rika responded with, "NO." Mizo then quickly asked, "Why?"

"DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PAIN I HAVE? PAIN OF EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW?! I'M SO TIRED AND YET I'M STILL GOING TO SCHOOL?! NECK PAIN, CAN'T EAT, CAN'T SPEAK! WHY AM I STILL GOING?! WHAT ELSE SHOULD I SAY THAT I HAVE SAID BEFORE? I'M TIRED, I'M IN PAIN, I'M SO LUCKY THAT MY PERIOD ENDED A WEEK AGO, OTHER FUCKING WISE I WILL BE SENT TO A HOSPITAL FOR HOW MUCH SCREAMING I'D BE DOING. DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE I SEE THE CARE FOR ME?! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, I'M IN PAIN AND ALL CAN PEOPLE SAY IS 'YOU'D BE OVER IT.' LIKE I CAN!!!!!!!!!!!" ranted Rika, before going offline.

"Rika..? I just wanted to.. nevermind. I understand, but.. your group mates are asking me if you're still going to school. So they can start the presentation." responded Mizo, as tense minutes came by with no response. He looked at the private message tab of his phone with worry, not knowing what Rika was doing. But he then noticed that Rika was at school now, wearing a neutral expression that Mizo knew was hiding immense pain.

"Rika! Uh, your group mates.." said Mizo, as Rika ignored him and went inside the classroom to put her bags down. "Your group mates are waiting for you right there..!" said Mizo, as Rika turned to them and grabbed some printed documents, gave it to them then got some paper then left the classroom. 

Mizo followed her until Rika turned her whole body to face them, then faced him at face level, since she was looking down the entire time. "Why.. are you following me.." questioned Rika, with a clearly weak voice and forced tone. "I.. I'm just concerned. You know your history, and I'm just.. checking up, as best friends do!" explained Mizo, as it clearly hit a nerve at Rika, making her swallow painfully. "Yeah.. yeah.." Rika turned her whole body away from him.

"Like.. I.. said.. I can't speak.. well. It hurts to use my throat for anything.. So **please**.. just leave me alone..." said Rika, clearly forcing her voice to be loud as Mizo saw her clutch the left side of her neck. "I can't.. I want to help you, how about the clinic?" asked Mizo, as Rika tensed up and shifted her body to look at him.

"Do.. you think.. that'll.. help..? If my parents are this.. uncaring about my neck pain issues.. you'd think that going to the clinic will help..? I have to go home anyway, they have to explain something that my parents have seen.. Can I do anything..? No.. I do not believe I can.. I can even present.. Every word.. is painful.. agonizing.. I'm only pushing through because of you.." explained Rhida as she clutched her neck again and gulped painfully. "I.. just don't want you to suffer alone, Rika. Or suffer at all. And, your self-harm history.. I just can't.. Is there anything I **can** do?" asked Mizo, as Rika is silent.

"If there is anything... I.. just accept what's going to happen, I'll be barely speaking, they'll grade me low, and I'll be suffering. That's it. There is nothing I could do. I'm sorry. I just.. didn't know how severe this neck pain issue is.. Ever since Sunday of Last Week, intense neck pain has been with me, as my condition worsens.. I don't even know if the condition worsens.. or the days just get worse.. I can't think properly either.. No wonder, I barely have done anything.." said Rika, as she sighs. "Just.. let me die in peace." continued Rika, as she walked away, Mizo stood there frozen in shock before trying to catch up to her. "Hey..!" called out Mizo, as he got a message from her. It reads;

"Pain. Worth nothing. I can't speak. I can't scream. This. Short messages of someone broken. Forgotten, ignored. An observer and an alien. Unworthy. Replaceable. A leach. An idiot. To wake up and try. To die in return. For I have confessed my sins, for I have not been redeemed. Sent to my hell, I will not return. Sent to die. Sent to suffer. Suffer eternally. These are words of someone in distress, someone not here anymore. Go home. Take the loss. For I can't find the sense in your suffering, go home, and rest. Survival first."

"W—what..?" commented Mizo as he looked at the message before quickly deciding to go to the classroom. He sees Rika, speaking to presumably her mom on the phone based off the conversation;

Rika: "Hello..? Mom, I want to go home." 

Rika's mom: "What?! Why?"

Rika: "My.. neck hurts remember..? No matter what I do, I won't be able to present. I.. can't speak properly.. I.. just wanna rest."

Rika's mom: "But it's a group presentation?! How are you going to present alone?! Can you even move up to grade 11?!"

Rika: "I.. can't."

Rika's mom: "Can you at least speak to your teacher about it? Or your group mates? You can just stand there and be on the technical side."

Rika: "It can't.. be."

Rika's mom: "I'm calling your dad."

*Hang up*

"Rika..?" asked Mizo, as he can see Rika wipe her tears away. "I—It's nothing. Go away." said Rika as she looked into the distance, her hands shaking with anguish. Mizo just sighed and moved nearby, behind her as she stood quietly, still shaking.

After a while, she gestured for him to come closer, as she started to rant again. "I don't know how much longer I can stand being here.. How long I can just.. take this pain. I.. want it all to disappear, the pain.. oh god the pain.. All I can do is.. nothing. Stand there, in that presentation, speak nothing and do nothing. They don't need me, but.. I need them. The grades.. I.. don't.. know.. what to say.. Mizo.. Nothing has worked." Rika looks at her phone, and starts to cry.

"No one.. I can't.. do anything! My parents push me this day to suffer longer.. suffer more.. all for a grade I won't get. I give up. Mizo. I'll.. accept whatever happens. I'm.. so sorry for bringing you into this. I'm.. going." Rika goes away and leaves, Mizo stands there, helpless and sympathetic.

## Stressed and Stretched

## Author's Note:

"After the complexities of the day before, time for healing is now."

Post-Traumatic Stress.. ahem.

Yeah, this one explores Rika's complicated situation being a person with intense sickness, battling school systems and her own insecurities, with Mizo as her companion and best friend. 

If you're here shocked by the previous section, welcome to Mizo/Rika's saga! Where we'll explore romance, friendship and trauma in the same chapter! But yeah, post-trauma recovery.
Hope.. you.. get some deep muses and thoughts once done, I guess.

"Well.. at least you were there." said Mizo as he drank some iced coffee with pearls. "Shut up.." Rika strained to say as they chilled on the mall chairs. "Worst part is.. can't even buy that.. is that why you bought that? Flex on me from my.. tonsillitis?" continued Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Hey, hey.. You should've bought one. I mean.. I think you can drink stuff like that still yeah?" asked Mizo as Rika moved her head from left to right, unsure. "I'm just.. making sure. It's not.. like.. I.. can think straight anyway." 

"Riiight.. you still have uh.. neck problems? Ooh and headaches. From what you've told me." said Mizo, as Rika nodded her head, while holding the left side of her neck. "I.. I'm.. handling it. It's just.. been.. so.. tiring to always remember to not be... turning my head willy-nilly." responded Rika, as Mizo nodded and turned to face her. 

"Hey, it's fine. I'm here. Just rest for now." said Mizo, as he held her hand. "I—I know. It's just.. it's been days.. it hasn't healed. And when I think it's about to disappear.. it reappears.. hurts.. every time..!" said Rika, as Mizo hugged her. A slight blush formed on her cheeks unnoticeable to anyone that doesn't know her. "You'll get through it, eventually.. it'll be gone. But, while you're here, you might as well rest yes?" said Mizo, as Rika feels comfort but also memories of trauma coming back. 

"Get through this.. I wish.. Mmmnnn.. Just.. stay with me.. for a bit longer." said Rika, as they continued hugging as Rika tried to lose herself in the warmth of a friend. The air between them was silent as people passed by, people going on their lives. But to these two, it was a much needed warmth they were missing for a while. Eventually, Rika pulled back as Mizo soon followed.

"Parents not home this.. week. Government stuff, don't remember." said Rika, as Mizo nodded. " 'Kay. I'll just.. I'll message my parents, hol' on." said Mizo, as he picked up his phone;

Mizo: hey ill be with my friend in her house for a while for like 2 days? Ill come back Saturday

Mizo's mom: oh? then are you getting your uniforms? oh, your dad's close, you should probably go back just to grab stuff for the next 2 days, love you~

Mizo: thanks, yea im getting them too

"I got their.. hm. permission? I just gotta go home. Then I'll get my stuff. Same house as before no?" asked Mizo, as Rika slowly nodded. "Yeah, same house.. D—don't worry, I'll wait near our gate. J—just call me when you're nearby.." answered Rika, as Mizo smiled and got his things. "Well, see you then. Love!" said Mizo, before booking it. "H—hey..! mmnn.. even now.. teasing dummy.. though.." said Rika, as she got her things too and sighed. "I.. wonder what.. he's going to do next?" continued Rika before a headache started worsening. "Agh.. mmm.. Y—yeah.. I'm going home.. just.. bear with me for a few moments, okay body..?" said Rika before going down the floor of the mall.

## Am I Dumb?

## Author's Note:

Hey so this one is a mix of past and present, experimental. But I just wanted to mix the dynamic and have a prelude to the Valentine's Special. I want to explore more than just; "tomboy-ish tsundere meets a push-and-pull teaser-typa' guy" but this is where it headed to, so I continued it. Anyways, hope you enjoyed it, even if it is a lot of romantic tension between two supposedly best friends!

Rika is walking silently across the pavement before entering the high school of her life, and with it, will start off her many misadventures, for now though, she's just a fresh high school student (Philippines Version) after her online class of 21-22 in Grade 7.

"I wonder.. if I'll meet anyone in this.. school..?" Rika thinks to herself as she walks to her classroom line at the flag raising ceremony. She sees a lot of people, future friends, then a certain Mizo, scrolling through his phone. "He seems like a weird kid. But, honestly.. I'm one too.." Rika comments to herself, as she notices him looking up then meeting her gaze before both look away.

Later that school day, Rika is looking for a place to hang out alone at when she finds Mijo taking her (intended) spot. "Hey..! Ahem.. ahem. That's.. uh.. my spot..!" said Rika, as Mizo looked at her and smirked. "Nah. You don't own any spot bruv." said Mizo as Rika took a step closer. "Well, it's just.. rude you know." said Rika, putting her hands on her hips. "Rude? I don't know you. How can that be?" questioned Mizo as Rika crossed her arms. "W—what? Well, it's just, that's my spot. I claimed it just this morning." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Well, I am here first, so it's mine now."

"Hays.. Fine. I'll just.. go there then, hmmph! Stupid." said Rika before going to a different spot nearby and started eating her snack. 

_Fast forward.._

"When we first met.." said Mizo as he looked on the balcony where that memory happened. "You were rude. Still rude to this day." said Rika as Mizo chuckled. "I admit, I just didn't want to talk to you during that time. Welp, how things change huh?" said Mizo as he quickly kissed Rika on the lips before pulling back. Rika was blushing as she stammered, "Sh—shut up.. We might be.. best friends now, but you kept your attitude about me."

"Oh? I'd say I changed." said Mizo as Rika does an exasperated sigh. "I.. fine. It's.. more.. um.. your personality didn't change, and we just.. know each other a lot more." responded Rika, as Mijo kissed her on the lips again, but pulled back before Rika could appreciate it. "H—hey! If you're going to kiss me.. at least make it last.." said Rika, as Mizo chuckled. "Oh? Didn't I hear you last week, avoiding my kisses? I accepted it, but now you want more?" said Mizo, as Rika's blush became more intense. "D—different.. situation..!! Okay? T—that's why I said that day only." responded Rika, as Mizo booped her at her forehead.

"Mnn.. stop.." said Rika as Mizo held her very close. "I—I.. I'm serious.. we're at school.." said Rika, as Mizo pulled back and shrugged. "Fine.. I guess. Though, when I look into your eyes... I see desire.. haha.." said Mizo, as Rika held Mizo's shoulders to calm her already intense blush down. Mizo stops as Rika stared him down,  like she's about to either kill or make out with him. "Stop.. please.. I.. beg. I'm about to melt here.." Rika says in a soft, needy voice. This surprised Mizo, and his instinct is to respond, "Fine.. fine.. I'll keep my teasing down, **for now**."

Rika pulls back, and pulls a smirk. "Well well.. You know, I was waiting to use that on you." said Rika, looking directly at Mizo. "You got me." responded Mizo, putting his hands up on the air. "But.. I am serious. No more of school kisses okay?" said Rika, as Mizo nodded. "School specifically? So when we go to the supermall later I can?" questioned Mizo, as Rika blushed slightly again. "I'll decide on that.. But..! S—still no surprises! I hate.. surprises.." said Rika, as Mizo grabbed her hand, the warm feeling washing over them both.

"Mm.. What..? Are you eager? We still have to go to Kari you know.." asked Rika as Mizo nodded. "My dearest love, we have to—" said Mizo, before Rika slapped him playfully. "No! We're not having that. Dummie. Just.. Make sure I wasn't an idiot for being friends with you... Come on, let's go." responded Rika as Mizo nodded with a smirk and started to walk.

## Deep Seeking

## Author's Note:

Ooh what's that? A Valentine's Special? By a person without an actual love to celebrate it? I'm just joking. But, yeah.. I had some.. 'free time' today (Procrastination 100) and well, we gotta have one, right?

Um, as for relationship implications, honestly, just assume most chapters are self-contained in their stories lol.

sidenote: I've realized I should connect these, so.. um, if they connect. They connect, but if they don't, they don't.

"Rika.. will you marry me?" Mizo asks, one leg kneeling with a ring box. "I.. I.." Rika stutters before the director, Kari shouts, "Cut!" Instantly both of them went away from the set, as Kari commented, "Great job you two.. Thanks for giving up your dignity as well, I promise.. our dignity will not die in vain, your director editor is the best.. well, somewhat good." Before turning to the camera that was stopped by herself to look over the footage again, as they are right behind her drinking some water.

"I'm.. **NEVER** doing that again.." Rika exclaimed as she drank some more water. "Unless we need a second take of course." said Mizo, as Rika slapped me on my arm. "I said. **NEVER.** I'm not that.. type! Oho, if I had a lover, I'd be making them beg for my love!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled and tugged on her arm, making her look. "No wonder you don't have anyone for tomorrow's 'Día de San Valentín'!" added Mizo, as Rika retaliated, "Like you have anything to say, incel boy. I'm sure whatever rizz you had, it had dissipated a long long time ago.." 

"Oh? Then why are you still here?" asked Mizo, as Rika faintly blushed before regaining her composure. "What?! Can't a woman just drink water while speaking to an idiot? Besides, what about you?" responded Rika as Mizo smirked. "Would I be wrong if I said because of you, dear **friend?**" asked Mizo, as Rika chuckled. "Oh? Then **'dear friend'** what if.. I left, hmm? Follow me, because you're a loser?" retorted Rika, as Mizo smiled and said, "Oh? Bold of you to assume that, as if I'd follow you.." while moving closer to Rika.

"Guys guys, are you going to kiss or something? Cause' I'm heading home to continue my editing, and I can't stand the romantic tension here..!" said Kari, as she finished cleaning up the set. "Romantic tension..? Hey! It's just friendly banter.. shut up!" said Rika, as Mizo chuckled as he placed his hand on her shoulder. "Yeah, yeah. No need to be so.. so touchy about it, right Rika?" said Mizo, as his face was close to Rika, her blush becoming more obvious.

"Gah! I'll leave now, before I witness the coupling of two obvious lovers." said Kari before leaving the set. "Mizo.. I uh.. think that was.. um.." said Rika, as Mizo held her hand. "Hey, you can share it, I'm not going anything you're not comfortable with." said Mizo, as he pulled away a bit. Rika sighed and leaned in to kiss Mizo, as Mizo kissed her back, surprising her but letting Mizo explore her mouth a bit before pulling back. "Just.. relieving some tension, that's all. Anyways, let's go! Let's catch up with that girl before she assumes we're having sex." said Rika, before dragging Mizo with her to Kari.

"You guys took your time.. well, I'd just assume it was a heart to heart and move on. Come on, let's go to the mall!" said Kari, as she walked them to their local supermall. They went inside and Kari gravitated to the shop offering pearl drinks, while Rika and Mizo followed her.

"Large iced coffee with pearl, 100% sugar, and more ice!" said Kari, as Rika and Mizo looked at each other with amusement. Then Rika ordered  next, "Uh.. I'll have.. um.. the iced chocolate drink one, uh.. normal sugar, normal ice.." Rika then turned to Mizo, as he stepped up. "I'll have the normal regular milk tea, in ice i guess.. normal ice and sugar too." They waited nearby as Kari was speaking to Rika.

"Please please come with me to that trinket store, I promise It'll be fun..!" said Kari to Rika, as Mizo was using his phone. "Uhuh, and then you'll convince me to buy a small keychain, then push me to gift it to Mizo?" asked Riza, as Kari smiled and waggled her eyebrows. "I.. fuck you.. let's just go already." said Rika before they finally got the order with Mizo.

"I'd assume you two are on a shopping spree? I'll be at the chairs outside— or at that shop where they sell flags, just call me whn you're done, you two, maybe I'll have a surprise for Rika here~" said Mizo as Rika slightly blush. "Uhuh.. yeah we'll be doing that, see ya then." responded Rika before Mizo smiled and left, as Kari dragged Rika off to the store.

## The Future of the Beyond

## Author's Note:

"Look to the past, look to the future.."

A reflective chapter on the future, and how it affects Mizo/Rika.

— jmb~

---

"I'd be.. a bit dumb if I said I wasn't worried." said Mizo, as he and Rika chilled on the 4th floor of a school building, the wind blowing. "Yeah, I know.. it's.. genuinely.. haunting to look at my future." responded Rika, as Mizo looked at her and gestured to her to elaborate. "I'm not doing so hot at math.. I have so many missings.. I can't.. can't.. do anything.. correct. One moment, another time, or this moment, things happen not in my favor. I.. had a reflection during friday last week, you didn't come to school, so I was alone for the entirety of the event." said Rika, as she sighs and gets her phone.

"In short.. I was.. alone. I felt.. just.. alone. The event went around me, and I got some cool songs to add to my playlist.. But, I was just there.. wallowing in my own misery. We have talked about it, but.. for that four hours.. I felt.. all of it coming back, the trauma, the fight... All of the pain from school.. I felt.. defeated. Those.. moments. I hate it. I just.. feel so powerless, y'know..? The.. things I'd hear.. things people say... I'd just wish to grab my razor and cut myself, if I hadn't had enough.. scars. All around, the atmosphere seems to be at least hopeful, but I feel no hope for the future now. I only see the future pain I'll feel." said Rika, as she paused for a minute, pondering before looking at the cloudy sky of the late afternoon.

"They'd ask me, what's your plan for tommorrow? For the next month? The next year? I.. don't know. Yet, I am always forced to pick. Somehow, I never got a proper way to speak to older people to back off. I'd feel.. like I'd be invalidated 'cause I'm a woman, or I'm in an emotional state, or just very sensitive.. I hate it. I don't.. need to know the future. I just want to focus on right now, right here, what **CAN** I do? I can't... enjoy stuff, when other people are around, if you or Kari aren't nearby and are with other people.. that includes certain family.. I often feel like I need to hide a lot of things. I feel... that their help is not what I need. What I need is for them to back off." continued Rika, as she held Mizo's hand, shaking a bit.

"I'm afraid. I'm afraid of losing you two. It's.. only a month until.. sections change again. I'm alone again. I can't.. live with this." said Rika, as tears formed on her eyes. "People.. say I have this certain sassy tsundere attitude, and.. while.. true, it's not like it's just a descriptor of who I am, but rather an insult. I'd feel defeated whenever people ask me about you and blame my problems because of you, and are distracting from schoolwork.. I hate them. But, the words go through. I don't want them to go through..." continued Rika, as she started crying.

"I know how.. exactly how you feel. For me, it's been like that, guess I have.. parents, not what'd I call perfect.. Just, not as blatantly disresepctful. Look to my future, they want me to choose something, follow my sister outside the city, or stay here. I don't like being told what I should do, and where I should go¸ yet it's almost pointless when the old people you talk to don't understand you. I think some try, but it really boils down to not assuming everything." said Mizo, as she brushed Rika's hair, as Rika moved closer to his chest.

"Worst part is.. what else do you want me to do? It's a constant battle for me, to live. I have two sides, one out for the pleasure, seeking happiness and comfort.. While the other one is my darker side, the one who thinks about what has happened and is going to happen, the one that rationalizes my suicidal thoughts.. Just one single jump.. and you don't have to endure it.. I hate thinking like this, but sometimes all I can do is walk away. Leave the conversation. *They think my guilt isn't high enough, oh boy if it were to go higher, I would've grabbed the nearest knife and cut my throat.*" said Rika, in-between sobs and constant push-and-pull from her to Mizo.

"I.. never suffered from physical.. pain, to hurting myself.. But, I've experienced blacking out nights, up and away, writing constantly. I don't know if half was me coping or half was rushing, but all I knew is that if I kept on typing, I'd feel better. Writing is my escape from this hellish school, we have different problems but we both suffer. Gaming is like an escape sometimes, but it can feel so guilty to come out of that and feel tired and your supposed parents going out on you because you're tired, even though yes, you do get tired from gaming. I don't like.. the constant productivity attitude. I struggle constantly with dealing with stuff I know I can do, but motivation often down for many external reasons." said Mizo, as he held Rika more tightly.

"Mizo.. it's.. more than that for me. I like playing music, I like making cool art, but.. when I finish a track or take a break, if I'm caught literally doing anything that seems like I'm just resting, I'm chastised. I hate them. I hate them. Can I just say I hate them? Because I **DO.** These things matter more than 'oh we just let you' no shit that's why I remember when you make me conflicted. Misusin' your 'authority'. Gah..! Days feel so short. Videos fly over. I want something to hold me at a time and a place. I want a moment to last. But as long as an internal battle rages on in my brain and heart.. I'll die knowing I messed up somewhere." said Rika, as she reciprocated and hugged him tightly too.

"There's.. no way both of us can comfort each other, except our presence.. I have my problems, you have yours. At least you have someone to speak it to, for most of the time." said Mizo, as Rika went closer to his face, slight blushing unknown to Rika. "Yes! That's why I.. can't, I just can't let you go... You have helped me so much.. I'd feel a piece had been torn off my body if you disappeared from my world..." interrupted Rika, as Mizo sighs and kisses her on the forehead.

"We'll be fine. Okay? The future is nearby, the past haunts.. But as long as we stay in this moment, we'll be safe.. even for just a moment." whispered Mizo, as she kissed her on the lips this time. He quickly pulled back, when Rika started to speak up again, "You're right.. But I want it to last forever... I can still hear the sounds of.. doors opening, and surprise sermons.. I.. wanna forget all about that.. but.. fine, just for this moment..." The two go silent as the two shifted between hugging, holding each other and just being present with each other.

"I'll.. say I want to say, fuck the system, but.. again.. I'm a loner. An outcast in a liberal science city. You and Kari, I like you two, I just.. don't believe it's enough. Getting something done.. is empty. Grades feel empty. Future looks empty. The past isn't all sunshines and rainbows, but... I'd wish for times where I didn't struggle with **living**." said Rika, as Mizo added, "I get it. I really do. It's not as simple as sprading a message, you have to live and breathe it. What I mean is, masking for us two isn't great, it makes the situation worse. You'll be hated. But, die knowing you weren't faking and you were livin in the moment." before he kissed Rika for a long while, before they broke off.

"Always find a way to.. amuse me. Let me.. rest my brain for a minute.." said Rika, with a smile and slight blush. "Same. I do not want this to be as gloomy as outside right now." commented Mizo, the atmosphere looking muted and gray.
