"Chainsaw Devil, wherever you are.." Yoru says as she looks around the alley. "I'll make you vomit Nuclear Weapons back up!" continued Yoru as she sat down on a devil's corpse and smiled confidently.

---

"What?!" Yoru exclaimed to Asa, as they walked home. "What do you mean there's no Chainsaw Devil?! There is. And I'm going to find him." reiterated Yoru, as they bump into Makima and some Public Safety officers. "Watch where you're—" Asa seea Makima's face. "..going." Asa looks at Makima looking at her as Makima was smiling. "We detected a Devil's presence here.." Makima says as she looks around her, and finds the alleyway Asa was from. "It seemed to have come from that alleyway."

Makima then turns to Asa. "You.. wouldn't happen to know what happened, miss?" Asa is already panicking as she just woke up, her hands shaking while Yoru cautiously watches Makima's movement silently. "N—no?" answered Asa, as Yoru cursed Asa for being terrible with tension. "Hm, I'll.. send the other two to investigate the alleyway, stay here." Makima says, before turning to the other two people with her and sending them to the alleyway as the two are left alone on the sidewalk.

The two look at each other, Asa trying to form an awkward smile but failing and Makima looking at her, still smiling. Then, as the two enter the alleyway. "I didn't expect you'd be.. descending this early, _**War.**_" Yoru was a bit surprised and Asa took a step back in utter shock and overwhelm, as Yoru took over Asa's body.

"So, you have found me, **_Control._**" said Yoru, narrowing her eyes. "Have you found the Chainsaw Devil?" asked Yoru, clenching her fists. Makima continued to smile, as she nodded and answered, "Yes. _He's mine_."

`Asa (to Yoru): W—what?! Control Devil too?!`

"Ms. Makima! There appears to be a devil's corpse, but no devil has been found." said one of the officers as Makima nodded and looked away from Yoru. "Very well. I suppose one of the other Private Devil Hunters must have took it out." Makima looks at Asa again. "But, I do want to speak to this girl to learn more." Makima extends her right hand. "Come with me to Public Safety." Yoru looks at Makima's right hand, and nods. "Let's go." Yoru shakes her hand aggressively before both pulled back.

---

"What is your full name?"

"Asa Mitaka." 

"Contract?"

"..."

"War Devil."

---

`"Your name is.. Asa?"` asked Yoru as they waited outside Makima's office. "Yeah? Why?" asked Asa to Yoru, as Yoru pondered. `"If we're going to survive Control, and you help me kill the Chainsaw Devil.."` Yoru smiled. `"Call me *Yoru.*"` Asa nods. "Ah.. o—okay..? Um, thanks I guess.. I was wondering if I was gonna have to call you, War or War Devil but.. Yoru's a.. good name I guess."


---

Asa enters Makima's office, wearing a baggy top with a t-shirt underneath and black pants. "Ms. Makima." Asa walks and sits in front of Makima. "Ms. Mitaka." said Makima, with a smile. "..or should I say, _War?"_ asked Makima, as Yoru took over Asa immediately, sensing the tense situation.

"..hello," Yoru visibly has red facial scars. "Control." Yoru's face is neutral. "So, why are you joining Public Safety..?" asked Makima, as Yoru was silent before smiling and saying, "..to avenge my family." Makima was silently pondering before nodding. "Family..? How.. poignant. Then, prove your usefulness to Public Safety." Yoru remained neutral as she nodded before Makima added, "..just know, War..." Makima smiled. "..this is _my_ territory."

Yoru scoffs but nods. "..I know that." Makima then leans in, "Then you must know, _Yoru,_ that I have.. eyes and ears everywhere..?" Yoru clenches her fists, nods again, before looking at Makima's eyes. "..I know that." she repeated. Makima looks at Yoru's eyes, same as hers, as Yoru looks back silently before Makima sits down. "Go. As a.. courtesy, I'll keep our little secret," Makima smiles at Yoru again. "for now. Do.. ensure it remains advantageous for me, Yoru." Yoru stands up. "Tch. I will." Yoru turns to leave, "There'll be a day where I'll win, Control." Yoru leaves as Makima broadened her smile, and commented, "Do so."

`W—what did you say to her?! We're going to die!` Asa said to Yoru, as she shut her up. "Silence. We **won't**." 

 

---

"Aki." Makima calls, as the two were at her office. "I have a new.. rookie that I want you to patrol with, for today." Makima pauses, before saying, "..Her name is Asa Mitaka." Asa opens the door, seeing Aki and Makima. "Hello.." Asa says as she walks beside Aki. "Asa, make friends during your time in Public Safety, okay?" asked Makima to Asa, before Asa reluctantly nodded. Aki scrutinized Asa before looking at Makima. "She's.. a human, Ms. Makima, why is **she** in the Special Division?"

Makima smiled, looking at Asa before looking at Aki. "She has.. a very _special_ secret devil contracted. I think it'd be best to put her here." Aki looked at Asa, who was looking down, fiddling with her shirt. "Okay, Ms. Makima."

---

The two were walking down a street as Asa held a metal pipe for a weapon. "Asa," Aki calls Asa, as Asa looks at him, neutral. "being a public safety officer is hard. You should be vigilant, and alert." Asa nods quietly, as Aki looks at Asa's metal pipe. "I don't know what your contract is, but it better be useful to Public Safety and Ms. Makima." said Aki, before they continued walking silently.

`Tch. Who does this guy think he is?` said Yoru to Asa, as Yoru appeared as a hallucination, walking beside Asa to her right, while Aki was on the left. `Some nerve, while serving as Makima's dog.` Asa mumbled, "We.. are in that situation, though.." Asa elaborated, "..you know, we could've stayed in High School.." Yoru responded, `Control is too much of a threat to ignore.` Yoru looks at some people walking near them. `If she was weak, then we could have stayed.`

"B—but is confronting her the way..?" asked Asa to Yoru. `Yes. If left unchecked, she'll erase War, Famine, Death..` Asa thinks, before asking, "Isn't that a good thing..?" Yoru responds, `And you'll be dead.` Asa's silent as they continue walking.

Aki sees Asa mumbling to herself, gripping the metal-pipe shaking, he sighs as they continue walking.

---

"Himeno." Aki says as he and Asa meet up with Himeno, and two other public safety officers. "Aki~" Himeno's eye raised when she sees Asa. "Oh? A new rookie? What's her name?" Himeno asks Aki, as he looks at Asa, expectantly. "Ah—? Um, I'm Asa Mitaka." said Asa to Himeno, as she smiled and looked at her holding the metal pipe for dear life. "Heh, she got into the special division?" asked Himeno to Aki, as they started to walk.

"Yes. Directly assigned by Makima." answered Aki, as Asa fell into step with the other two at the back, who she intentionally avoided facing. "Oh? Then.. she's another special interest?" continued Himeno, as Aki nodded. "She has a secret devil contract." answered Aki as he side-eyed Asa. "What devil is so special to Miss Makima that she assigned the girl here, I don't know." finished Aki, as Himeno nodded.

"A devil sighted on—" Asa couldn't hear the garbled location, "—at—" nor the time engagement from the walkie-talkie Aki took out.

"Let's go." Aki says to all of them.

`Yoru (to Asa): These are the rest of Makima's pawns? Hm, let's stick with them until we find the Chainsaw Devil.` Asa nodded.

---

"Kon." said Aki, holding up an iconic fox gesture at the Leech Devil holding up Denji as it was eaten by the Fox Devil then they asked, "This's the Leech Devil. Can I swallow it?" Aki answered, "You may." before they disappeared. "Leech Devil's extermination confirmed." Aki turns to Asa, and the other two newbie officers. "Newbies, aid and evacuate the survivors!" Asa answered, "Yes, sir." as the other two did as well. Asa moved with them to civilians as Asa overheard, "Himeno, as our senior..." before it trailed off.

`Yoru (to Asa): First work as an officer, Asa. And it's.. to..` Yoru looks at Asa disappointedly. `"..to aid civilians."` Yoru sighs. `"Just finish and don't mess it up."` Yoru looks around. `"The Chainsaw Devil might be nearby."` Asa stops in her tracks as she looks at where Aki is carrying some badly beat up guy, but they're turned away from her so she can't see who Aki is carrying on his shoulders. "I wonder who's that..?" mumbled Asa to herself, as Yoru looks at Asa, determined. 

`Yoru (to Asa): We will figure it out.` before Asa goes and tries to help the other two.

---

Asa is silently waiting at the hospital, leaning on the wall as Himeno sits down next to some red horned girl who's handcuffed. "Asa?" Himeno looks up at Asa, looking down at the floor. "Are you not assigned to any patrol?" asked Himeno, as Asa nodded respectfully. "Ms. Makima hasn't assigned me any, so I've just been helping around.." explained Asa, as the red-horned girl looked at her. "Hey human!"

Asa looks at the girl. "Huh?" The girl continues, "Get me out of these cuffs!" Himeno steps between Asa and the girl as she maintains her view of Asa. "Don't. She's currently cuffed because she left _someone_ to die." explained Himeno, before looking at the girl. "Just.. wait, Power. Aki'll determine if you're innocent." Power groans and tries to get out of her cuffs but to no avail and just whines before being resigned. Himeno sits back sown as Asa looks back down.

`"Power, huh? I wonder what Fiend this is, being controlled by humans like that.` Yoru thought loudly to Asa.

_Aki opens the door._

"See? I told you I was innocent!" Power holds her cuffed hands up. "Now that you know it, get these things off me!" Aki looks at Himeno. "You sure about this?" asked Himeno as she looked at Power then Aki. "If little Miss Fiend here kills somebody one day, it'll be on you for looking the other way, Aki." continued Himeno, as she sees Aki go and uncuff Power. "We are Devil Hunters." said Aki as Himeno stood up. "We ought to use every tool at our disposal to do our job—even devils and fiends." Aki glares at Power, who is checking her wrists.

"But enemies are enemies..." Aki maintains his stare. "We're _only_ using them. I have no intention of _getting friendly_ with them." Aki turns away as Himeno follows. Asa and Power look at each other then follow.

`"..Aki sounds scary honestly."` Asa says to Yoru, mumbling. `"Coward. But he makes sense. I have no intention of getting friendly either."` replies Yoru, as Power notices Asa's mumbling. Asa finishes with, "Hah, yeah.. it's.. very stressful."

---

_Asa spends the next few days with Aki and Himeno.._

Asa smacks the Fish Devil surprisingly hard with her metal pipe as Aki finishes it off and gets a silver bullet from its guts.

"Found one." said Aki as he stood on the devil's body as Asa was breathing heavily soaked in blood. "Huh, nice rookie." Himeno was looking at Asa before she jumped up to sit on the devil's head. "Ah." Himeno puts her right hand on her chin as she begins to talk, "Figured it'd eaten one of that damn gun's chunks."

`Yoru (to Asa): Gun?`

**"But.. did it _eat_ that... or was it _fed_ that?"** pondered Himeno loudly.

`Yoru (to Asa): "How can some lowly devil eat a part of the Gun Devil?` Asa is taken aback. "The.. Gun Devil?" asked Asa to Yoru, mumbling again. `"Gun Devil Fragments. From your memories, I learnt that it disappeared from the face of the earth."` Yoru makes Asa focus on what Aki is holding. `"Though, it likely disintegrated and its fragments scattered."` Asa nods. "Yeah.." 

"Hey, rookie." Himeno called Asa, as she looked at Himeno, a bit dazed. "We're going back to HQ." Himeno looks at Aki. "Let's go." continued Himeno, as Aki looked at Asa suspiciously before sighing as the two got off the Fish Devil. "Let's give the fragment to Ms. Makima as well. Come on." Aki and Himeno walk forward as Asa followed, blinking quickly. 

"_She's_ collecting them?!" Yoru commented `to Asa`, as she nodded. "What _is_ she planning.." Yoru trailed off as they look at Asa and Himeno talking about something Asa can't hear.

---

_As Himeno and Aki left the office, and Asa was going to follow.._

"Asa.." said Makima as Asa stopped in her tracks. "Y—yes, Ms. Makima?" asked Asa, turning to face her. "Sit down, I want to have a little _chat_ about our current goals at Public Safety." commanded Makima, Asa nods politely and sits down in front of her. "As you have seen, we've been collecting **Gun Devil Fragments.**" Makima smiled. "But I haven't told you the reason." Makima stands up and looks at the window, turning her back to Asa.

"I'm sure you know of the Gun Devil incident thirteen years ago.." Makima side-eyes Asa, who was shaking. "Right now, Public Safety is collecting its fragments to find and eliminate it." Makima turns to Asa, smiling. "I'm sure that won't.. cause problems in the future, _Yoru?"_ Asa gasps as Yoru takes over. "..and what _exactly_ are you implying?" asked Yoru, as she stood up, facing off Makima. "Nothing, _nothing_." Makima sits down, looking away as Yoru does.

"How **is** Special Division Four?" Makima sips coffee. Yoru eyes Makima as she answers, "Boring. I've been fighting low-level devils that take a single hit to kill." Yoru smiles. "Is that all you have planned, _Control?"_ Makima smiled faintly as she looked back. "Remember that at anytime, I can.. _inform_ of your presence, Yoru." commented Makima, as she looked at the door behind Yoru. "I can make you a.. _threat_ to Japan and.. **Public Safety**." Makima looks at Yoru. "We.. wouldn't want that, right _Asa?"_

`"Y—Yoru?! We—we'll die if you keep—"`Asa says to Yoru before she silenced her. "Fine." Yoru stands up. "But I _will_ win. You will not restrain me!" Yoru storms out as Makima sips her coffee, content.

`"W—what are you thinking?! If you keep talking to her like that, we might *just* die! Then your plans of defeating the Chainsaw Devil won't become reality! *You* pushed me to join, so *figure* out how to save us!"` Asa rants to Yoru, as Yoru was clenching her fists. "I'm trying." said Yoru, as she glared at Asa's hallucinated form. "But first.." Yoru looks at the door to Makima's office. "..we need to find the _Chainsaw Devil._"

---

"Devil Extermination Request for Public Safety."

"Devil Sighting inside Morino Hotel. Survival of Hotel Guests is unknown. According to the request, multiple civilian devil hunters have died in extermination attempts. Movement from a Gun Devil piece confirmed. It's likely a devil has ingested another piece. Dispatching seven hunters from Public Safety Extermination Special Division 4."

Asa is behind Aki, while a tall man looks at her neutrally. She can see Himeno teasing a girl while Power argues with some dumb blonde guy.

`"Let's kill this devil."` said Yoru, as Asa nodded. "Yeah, I hope.." Asa mumbled, as they continued walking.

### Author's Note:

So, I'm a bit nervous about posting this. I re-read it like **only** twice so I'm worried this isn't good, but here! It's a start! To set expectations, this part is going to focus on the Public Safety Arc, and that's the current scope. I *can* continue to Part 2, through the earlier arcs, but that's for the future, and what the manga would do, so yeah.

I apologise if any details here are a bit loose, or uncharacteristic, I haven't mastered writing Chainsaw Man. Any criticism is welcome, I'm trying to be as accurate as possible, while allowing creative choices as part of the AU. This covers the Intro and Bat Devil Arc, and some backstory to describe Asa and Yoru but not fully. I know the cliffhanger is like, somewhat irritating but trust me! I'll complete it.. **someday!** 

Schedule: Monthly! (Can be biweekly, but depends on the length of the chapter..)

Anyways, that's it, enjoy life~!

notes

6th ep s1 | 14-17th + half of 18th CSM chapter

oh and this is taking a while, huh? might not complete it before exams?? (that was indeed the case - jmb from jan.29.2026)

seriously there's so many words I have to copy from the manga...

true that's why you should sit down and write sometimes, good now that you tripped and your leg sprained and you literally can't do anything athletic with your legs, focus on using that brain for something! (jan.29.2026)

uhh no, I just let my days pass without any action.. woops (feb-05-2026)

"A devil is lurking somewhere inside this hotel." explained Aki as he looked at the group behind him. "And it's not just any devil, either." Aki gestures to the Gun Devil Fragment dangling from his hands being pulled to the direction of the hotel. "This piece of the Gun Devil's flesh is being pulled toward it." Aki's look gets a _bit_ grimmer. "There must be a devil that ingested another piece here."

"You sure the Gun Devil itself ain't here?" asked the dumb blonde guy before Aki answered, "The larger the chunk, the stronger the pull." Aki sternly glanced at the guy. "This pull is too weak for that."

"Hey.. Asa, is it?" the tall stern guy who Asa noticed has a scar on his left cheek. "Y—yeah?" responded Asa, as the guy extended his hand. "I haven't introduced myself, I'm Arai," Arai smiles faintly. "Arai Hirokazu." Arai points to the girl shaking while Himeno is speaking to her. "That's Kobeni Higashiyama, I'm sure you two will get along." Then he turns to the blonde guy and red-horned girl. "Those are the.. devils fighting with us. The girl's Power, the guy's name's Denji."

Arai steps into Aki's view. "Sir.. can we..."

`Yoru (to Asa): Hm, Asa.. those two. Power, and Denji.. They say that they're devils of some sort.. Maybe we can identify what Devil they are if we ask them. Maybe they know where the Chainsaw Devil is.` Asa is a bit surprised, "Didn't take you for a talker, but.." Asa looks at Denji and Power whispering loudly to each other. "..yeah.. It's probably less awkward to talk to them."

"**THAT! was way beyond a prank!!**" Aki shouted, raising his hand to point at Denji and Power. "**I'll KILL YOU!!**" Himeno walks beside Aki, confused. "Scary... What the heck happened...?" Himeno glances at Aki before looking at Denji. "C'mon Aki, you can't be strict with them all the time." Denji adds, "Yeah what she said! That bat almost killed me, and now it's straight back to work!" Denji moves his hands to his sides. "Gimme a reward!"

`Yoru (to Asa): This is painfully annoying. Even I can sense you hate listening to this.` Asa nods. "Ugh, I have to speak to them.." Asa narrows her eyes. "This is gonna be a drag.." Asa looks around just as Himeno gets close to Kobeni. `"You're not going to like Himeno, hm?"` Yoru smiled. `"Just look at that Kobeni human."` Asa shudders. "I wish I could say I'll push her away but.." 

"I already decided who my first kiss is gonna be." said Denji, as he looked to the side of Aki. "Like, I'm gonna collect these meat chunks or whatever for her..." Denji lazily looks at Himeno. "...and then murderize the Gun Devil. I'm not smooching anybody till then."

Yoru narrows her eyes as Asa looks at Denji. `"He's.. going to kill the Gun Devil?"` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Is this Makima's doing?"` Yoru thinks harder. `"Or maybe that Power girl, but.."`

Kobeni appears in front of Asa. "Oh, um.. I saw you.. just standing there mumbling to yourself, shaking..." Kobeni smiles, still shaking. "Are you also scared of the devils?" Asa hesitated to answer before nodding. "Yeah.." Kobeni turns to walk towards the rest of the group. "Let's go.. do our job." said Kobeni in a sad way that made Asa immediately feel pity for her, as she follows.

---

Asa is at Power's left and behind Kobeni as they walk inside the hotel.

"**Acting independently is dangerous!! Stop!!** Arai chases Denji, before managing to pin him.

Asa overhears Kobeni's nervous mumblings and Power's blood mumblings.

But then Denji scuffled with him as Arai continued, "Himeno has trained me for half a year. I'm in her debt!" Arai keeps pressing his right elbow on Denji's right hand. "If some punk from who knows where is going to steal her lips..." Denji's left hand is trying to push Arai on his left shoulder. "Move it!!" Denji pushes harder but fails to budge an inch. "I don't want some guy pressing up against me!! It's creepy!! Go to hell!!" Denji finally manages to push Arai back. "You and I got different burdens, man!!"

Asa sighs as Yoru side-eyes Power. `"Blood.."` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Asa, Power might be the Blood Fiend."` Asa mumbled, "Huh?" Yoru makes Asa look at Power. `"Red horns, a feature of a fiend.. and she's looking for blood while completely unharmed.."` Asa gulped, as she overheard Aki and Himeno talking.

"As for Denji... Too many unknown factors. It's still too soon to say." said Aki, before looking at Power. "The Blood Fiend's strong, but a hothead. It's still possible she'll betray us." Aki looks directly at Asa's back as she tried to maintain her walking stride. "Asa.. I don't know what her deal is, but she's like Kobeni. Timid, but pretty strong." Aki stops to think before saying, "You've seen her keep up with us before."

"Hm." Himeno then asks, "Think these five newbies can **survive?**" Aki answers immediately, "Most people either die, or go private after a year, regardless of how strong I thought they were." Himeno responded with, "You sure dodged the question..." Himeno pauses before saying, "**Don't you die, Aki.**"

Everyone suddenly stops in their tracks as a front and nearby door slowly creaks open.

`Yoru (to Asa): Finally. A devil."` Asa tenses up.

The devil looks to be a head with a foot and hand attached to the left and right, respectively. 

It jumps up as it passes over Kobeni anxiously avoiding it as Himeno stops it using some invisible force. "Caught you." said Himeno, as Asa hears someone running and turns to see Power making a blood weapon. " 'Tis a battle!" said Power as she slices the devil in half. Kobeni is panicking just as Power commented, "The damn devil froze in midair out of fear of me!" before laughing maniacally.

"No, No, No. That was my power!" Himeno puts her right hand on her chest. "My **ghost** caught it!" said Himeno, as Power was confused. "Ghost?" she asked. "I have a contract with the **Ghost Devil.**" answered Himeno, as she pointed to her eyepatch and began explaining.

"Ghost Devil.." Asa mumbled to Yoru, as she looked at Himeno. `"Interesting."` uttered Yoru, pausing before commenting, `"It's strong, but weaker than me."` before Asa was brought back to reality.

"Gotcha..." said Himeno, looking at Aki. "Let's move up a floor then!"

Asa tunes out Power and Himeno as she walks and talks with Yoru. "So far so easy.." mumbled Asa as they continued climbing. `"It likely isn't the devil itself. Stay focused."` reiterated Yoru, looking around. `"You might be walking into a trap, considering how it didn't show its true self when all of you entered."` speculated Yoru, before Asa stopped when Power had a blood weapon on and was being choked by Himeno using her ghost arm.

Himeno pulls back her ghost arm as Power coughs and they start walking again. "I don't wanna have to do that again so how about we get along?" warned Himeno, before Power commented to Denji, "I'll eat her one of these days!" Denji responds, "Hey, she's gonna kiss me. Don't eat her!" 

Arai suddenly stops as everybody does so too. "Wait, Huh...?" exclaimed Arai, before Aki asks, "What is it?" Arai looks at the sign saying 'Floor 8' then continues, "Just now... didn't we go up the stairs from the eighth floor to the ninth?" Aki answers, "Yeah." Arai worryingly says, "This is floor eight too!" Denji questions, "You didn't see wrong or count wrong?" Arai's determined and answered, "No! I'll go double-check!" Asa sees Arai rush downstairs only to appear upstairs soon after.

"Oh no.." Asa mumbled as Yoru pondered, `"Interesting. I can probably bust out of here, but.."` Asa looks at Himeno who also tried going down only to end upstairs too. "Aki... What the hell is this...?" questioned Himeno to Aki. "Probably a devil's power." answered Aki before rushing to a room's door as the others followed. "Huh?" asked Kobeni as Aki entered and shouted, "Kobeni! Stay right there!"

Asa herself went to the opposite room, looking around, finding a window as Aki appears seemingly behind it. "Asa..?" Aki goes through the window and passes by Asa, who was frozen in place, seeing Kobeni outside. "I was afraid of this..." said Aki, as Kobeni turned around and went, "Huh?!" Asa walked near Aki as she saw Denji shout, "Hey! None of the windows lead outside! They're all connected to the rooms on the opposite side!!" Aki sweats as he looks down and utters, **"We're stuck on the eighth floor..."**

---

Asa lays down on the bed of a room beside Kobeni as Aki gives a rundown of the situation. But, right now, Asa is stressing over what is happening.

"Yoru.. can't you do something to let us leave here?" asked Asa to Yoru. `"Probably. But it'll be revealing our power too soon. **Ms. Control** wouldn't like it."` Yoru looks at the others, as Denji speculates on why they're trapped. `"We haven't seen what that Denji boy does."`Yoru looks at Aki and Himeno. `"While we're trapped, we haven't even seen what the devil looks like."` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Besides, we need to exterminate the devil here. It'll probably show itself once it thinks we're weak."`

"We're all going to die here..." Kobeni is internally panicking, but she's visibly shaking. "We're going to starve to death..." Arai moves to her front, encouraging. "K—Kobeni! Stay strong!" said Arai, as Asa looked on, unamused. Yoru comments, `"I wonder why that girl's here."`

"..older brother through college, remember?!" Arai has his fists to his chest, trying to motivate Kobeni. "I was half forced into it..." explained Kobeni, as Asa tensed up a little, getting a little snicker from Yoru. "My parents only care about my gifted brother... They want to put him through college, so they put **_me_** to work..." explained Kobeni, tearing up and voice cracking. "My only options were to be a sex worker or devil hunter!"

"But I wanted to go to college too!!" Kobeni puts her hands on her face. "But I'm gonna die here!!"

"You know.." Asa mumbled to Yoru, as Yoru smiled. "being **stuck** here.." Asa curled up. "sucks. I would rather deal with those shitty classmates than die here.." Yoru commented, `"And where did that get you? Left dead in an alley by your classmate."` Asa sighs. "I know, **I know..** a—aside from that!"

"Oh, Kobeni... Fear is a devil's favourite food." Himeno pats Kobeni's head, looking empathic. "If you act scared, you'll be giving them exactly what they want." Kobeni then squeaked, "But I'm so scared!!" before Kobeni turned to Aki, leaning on a wall. "You too, Aki. What's the matter?"

"Ughh.." Asa muffled into a nearby pillow as she stared at Aki and Himeno conversing. `"As much as I hate waiting, we.. have to wait, these idiots will eventually figure out something to escape here. I might cause too much 'collateral damage' if I tried."` Asa kept smacking her head onto the pillow. "My *last* ***moments*** are going to be dying of boredo—"

*"That's amazing! Then we can sleep as much as we want!!"* commented Denji, as Asa immediately focused back to the main conversation. Everyone stared at him before Arai replied, "Are you stupid...? We could be trapped here **forever...**" Denji responds with, "It might turn out that way, and it might not, right? Wake me up when you figure it out." Denji closes his eyes. "These beds are so comfy. It'd be a waste not to sleep in 'em. I'mma appreciate this devil an' catch me some Z's..." Everyone stared at Denji before Aki went closer and looked at him more intently. "He fell asleep..." Aki commented.

Aki stepped back from Denji and looked at everyone else. "Himeno, let's check if we can use the electricity and water." Himeno and Aki walked to the CR nearby and opened its door as Aki opened the lights of it. "Huh," voiced out Himeno as Aki turned on the sink and it started pouring out water before he closed it. "So those work.." Aki nods. "Asa, Kobeni, search for food around here, we might be able to survive. In the meantime, I'm hunting this devil down."

"Aki—" Himeno called out before Arai spoke up, "Dont worry, Ms. Himeno, I'll help Aki." Arai stood up to move to Aki's beside. Himeno was silent before saying, "..stay safe, Aki." Aki nods as he and Arai headed out.

"Alright, now that the boys are out.." Himeno looks at the two remaining. "Why don't we search for luggage around here?" before the two got up and looked around, Himeno going near Kobeni as she noticed Power rambling alone to herself. "What is the fiend doing..?" Himeno thought loudly as Power looked around and found Asa nearby looking through a cabinet. "Hey, human! What do you think will make humans praise me?"

Asa stills for a moment before replying, "Winning the nobel prize?" as Power lights up. "Oh? There's a prize? Then, humans will grovel over me! This is really thought-provoking, I must figure out how to win it.." Asa adds, "I.. think you win it by have a very good invention, so.." Power leans forward to Asa. "Oh! Then, I must think of the perfect nobel-prize winning invention, so I can use it as a stepping stone to the prime minister, then I'll make humans _suffer!_"

`"Hm, I like this fiend's attitude. Though, she could've been less obvious about it to you humans."` commented Yoru, as Asa nodded. "Yeah.." Asa finds a bag and splays it on the nearest bed as Himeno and Kobeni helped Asa search through it. "Oh, some cans and candies~" Himeno picked out the consumables from the other stuff. "T—this is our—?!" Kobeni moves away from the pile as the other two look at her, *"I—I can't take this anymore!!"* said Kobeni, rushing to the bathroom as Himeno followed after, while Asa trailed behind. "H—hey! Kobeni!" called out Himeno as Kobeni opened the lid of the toilet and tried to put her head closer to the water in it. **"Kobeni!"** Himeno knocked out Kobeni with a knee kick, knocking her to the floor. 

"W—what.. did she try to do?" questioned Asa, arriving at the doorway of the bathroom as Himeno hurried over to Kobeni and lifted her unconscious body up. "She.. tried to drink from the toilet..." answered Himeno before she walked past Asa and laid down Kobeni on a bed nearby. Asa huffed as she went to the pile of consumables and contemplated their situation, "Ms. Himeno.. do you.. think we'll make it out?" Asa looked at Kobeni. "We might not starve, or dehydrate but like.." Asa looked down in utter dread. **"..just go insane."**

Himeno is silent as she looked at the clock still stuck at '8:18' on the night stand nearby before getting up, "We're going to try." Himeno gets up and opens the door outside the room. "I'm going to check up on Aki, you.. watch over the others, okay, Asa?" ordered Himeno as Asa looked up and faintly nodded before looking back down. Himeno left the room as Asa tried to drown out Power's ramblings nearby as she was exhausted.

`"We could try making a weapon."` spoke up Yoru, as Asa sighed. "If we can't even find the devil, what would that do..?" Asa mumbled, as she looked at her metal pipe that she put nearby the bag and consumables. `"Something to do. You're not talking to that fiend for info on the Chainsaw Devil, so I figured we should prepare a weapon."` replied Yoru, as Asa looked up and looked at Yoru's hallucinated form beside her. "She's so hard to talk to! Besides," Asa yawns. "I'm feeling sleepy, and.. I might as well sleep now... Maybe I'll *die in my sleep* and I won't have to think about the mistake of coming here in the first place!" Yoru looks at her unamused before replying, `"Sleep then."` as she looked at the people around them. 

Denji is still sleeping, Kobeni is knocked out and Power is excitedly rambling about, "Oho~ What makes humans suffer the most when I become the prime minister..? Taxes are a goods start, uh..." as Himeno, Aki and Arai are still outside. `"Once you wake up, and you humans still haven't found a way out, I will take you over and do it my own way."` warned Yoru as Asa falls asleep.

---

"Asa... wakey wakey!" Himeno was leaning forward to Asa's face as she opened her eyes. "Huh..?" Asa looked around, as Himeno comments. "You fell asleep too, huh? I understand, we're all pretty tired, buut..!" Himeno looks at Denji and Power, where Denji is sleeping and Power is *somehow* still rambling. "I moved Kobeni to another room, by the way. It's where Arai is nearby, we should move to watch over them both." explained Himeno as she looked back at Asa. "Wha.. what happened?" asked Asa as she and Himeno got up from the bed. "He's freaking out now too, and now he won't come out the room I mentioned." Himeno and Asa got close to Power and Denji. Himeno moved closer to Denji as Asa sat nearby Power, watching.

"Human!" Power poked Asa's arm as she noticed and looked at her. "What do humans hate the most?" Asa stared down at the mattress. "Um, I think.. taxes??" Power immediately replied, "Taxes! I've heard topknot complain about them before.." as the two saw Denji look at Power. 

"And then there's the fiend and Asa.." Himeno looks at the two. "Power and Asa? What about them?" asked Denji as Power suddenly spoke up again. "I'm bored! So I was thinking up a Nobel Prize-winning invention!" Power suddenly lays down, propping up her head with her right hand, while her left side was on the mattress. "If I win a Nobel prize, humans will grovel before me! And then I'll use my Nobel Prize as a stepping-stone to become prime minister!" 

Power suddenly raised her left hand, making a fist pointing up as she leaned slightly up. "I want to watch humans suffer... so my first act as prime minister will be to implement a 100 percent sales tax!" Denji looks at Himeno. "Power seems to be the same as always to me." commented Denji, as Himeno replied, "Oh, that's... good then. Asa's fine, she just fell asleep like you." Asa turned from looking at Power to Himeno. "We should go, I'll tell you two why on the way." Himeno says to Denji and Power as they headed out of the room.

---

Himeno was in front, Denji and Power behind her and Asa behind the two. "The four of us will guard Kobeni and Arai." explained Himeno, as they walked over. "Can't even take a bathroom break if I'm the only one doing it." The four entered the room as Himeno sat on the window sill. Denji knelt down nearby, placing his arms on the same window sill while Asa leaned on the window to the left of Denji, and Power remained standing. Himeno took out a cigarette and lit it.

"Darn. Down to the last cigarette!" said Himeno as she smoked. "You three are too calm, it's no fun!" said Power, as Himeno held the cigarette away to talk.

`"Well.. I'm used to having a devil lusting for war in my head every day so.. I'm.. slowly getting used to it..."` thought Asa as she looked at Power. 

"Hey, that's the same brand that jerk smokes." commented Deniji, as Himeno looked at him and responded, "That's because I'm the one who taught Aki to appreciate the taste of cigarettes." Denji stood up as Aki entered the room.

"Himeno... Do you have any cigarettes left?" asked Aki, masking worry. "Sorry! This is my last one!" answered Himeno, pointing to her mouth when Aki went close to her. "Then let me have that one." responded Aki, as Himeno commented, "Seriously? You hopeless addict.." commented Himeno before putting her cigarette into his mouth.

*"That's a kiss! An indirect kiss! No fair!!"* shouted Denji, before Aki says, "Shut up." taking a moment to smoke before telling, "I've got bad news. Remember that devil we killed..?" Power interrupts, "**You mean the one *I* killed!**" before Aki continued, "**Yeah, well, it's gotten bigger. A *lot* bigger...**" The five ran out and see the monstrous form.

It is a mix of skin and flesh mixed with hands and feet jotting out of its monstrous body. Contorted faces dot this body as it slithered all over the hallway from the room it seemed it came from.

"W—what the..." Asa tensed up. `"Another devil with an easy to hit flesh..."` Asa felt Yoru get aroused with murderous intent.   `"Tch. Asa, I can easily deal with this devil. But.."` Asa looks at Himeno and Aki cautiously stare at the devil while Himeno talked. `"..let's let the humans play, Control won't like me messing up their mission."` Yoru let out a chuckle, as Asa also unintentionally did before she stifled it with her hands. 

"Human. Humans. Foolish Humans. I'll offer you a contract." said the devil, barely intelligible. Denij commented, "**It spoke!**" before Aki added, "A contract...?" The devil continued, "Let me eat that human named Denji. Dead or Alive, feed him to me, and I'll return all of you other devil hunters to the outside unharmed." It slithers ever closer as it starts repeating, "I'll return you unharmed, make a contract with me..." as Denji looks worried.

The five suddenly look to see Kobeni awake, holding a knife, shaking. "Denji, Let it eat you..." as she slowly approaches before charging with her knife pointed to Denji's heart. Denji goes into a fighting stance as Kobeni screamed, "Eeyahh!!" before being disarmed by Aki and elbowed by Himeno to the ground. The devil laughed as Himeno said, "Oh, shut up. Aki, can't you end this by swallowing it with your fox?"

**"Kon."** responds Aki, making a fox-like figure with his right hand towards the devil.

**Nothing happens.**

"No fox... I had a feeling that would happen. This place is completely cut off from the outside after all.." commented Aki, as Himeno added, "And your fox's body is in Kyoto..." Himeno then brought her hand, palm to the front as she said, "All right. Then I'll finish it with my ghost." before forming a fist, just as the ghost teared through the devil it suddenly expanded. "Crap... It got even bigger!" as she moved back.

"It's no use. This is not my real body. My heart is not here. This is inside my stomach. My weak point is not on the eighth floor. Making a contract with me is the only way you can leave alive."

`"Oh? I suspected as much..."` commented Yoru as Asa felt more uneasy. "If we can't damage this thing with blunt attacks, how will we..?" Yoru interrupts, `"But why does it want Denji? This idiot doesn't look important."` Asa nods, also bewildered. "W—why weren't we informed who Denji is?!" whisper-screamed Asa before her focus shifted to Arai, behind her.

"We can kill him for now, and come up with a counterplan after we get out... At this rate, we'll all starve to death right here in the hotel." Arai's voice became more stern. **"Devil Hunters making contracts with devils is legal! The wisest course of action is to accept the devil's contract!"**

"This devil wants to kill Denji.. His death must benefit the devils somehow." Aki looks at Arai before answering, "I won't take this contract." Himeno moved her hands to the back of her head before adding, "Me neither then."

"But...!" opposed Arai, before Power interrupts with, "**I'm on Team Kill Denji!**"

`"So, they're not taking the contract? Interesting."` commented Yoru, as Power whispered to Denji about something. "I would've taken it.." mumbled Asa, before she overheard Aki explain, "Fiends and Devils can't make contracts with each other. Even if you did kill Denji, the devil wouldn't be obligated to let you out."

"Anyway, we aren't killing Denji. We're Devil Hunters. We only kill Devils." finalized Aki, as Yoru comments. `"Hah, Foolish humans. I would've sacrificed this idiot to that devil, as long as he's not the Chainsaw Devil."` Asa nodded, as she sat down on the floor. "We're stuck again, and I can't make contracts too.." whined Asa as Yoru taunted with, `"If you want, I could take over, but it will cause the death of everyone here."` Yoru looked at the others with a grin. `"A little spinal sword here, and a flesh grenade there..."`

"No..!" Asa whisper screamed to herself as Aki looked at her due to the noise before he stared back to a wall. Asa sighs, as she leaned on the wall and looked up at the ceiling. Asa temporarily drowned out the noise, as she contemplated her life again.

`"How did I get here..?"`Asa thought as she thought back to school. `"I've always wanted to die, since the world's a fucking mess. My school, my city.."` Asa looked at the three beside her conversing about something she didn't try to process. `"I learnt an important lesson from that day, live selfishly, but—"` Asa stopped herself as she looked down. `"I—I am about to die!!!"`

Asa was suddenly pulled out of her trance, as the devil lurched it's flesh forward. Asa retreated along with the other three as the devil repeated in a trance, "Kill Denji. Give me his heart. **Give it.**" The devil expands as it explained, "I expand with fear, and engage in fear. Your deaths are guaranteed."

"Feel more fright. Dread death. Fear everything." The devil further expands and darkens. "The one to kill ***the chainsaw,*** will be me, me.. **The Eternity Devil."**

Asa gasped as the room tilts, Yoru's eyes widened as she processed the words of that devil. The room tilts as Asa and the other three rush to an open room to the opposite of where Kobeni and Arai would be. The hotel completely tilted to it's right as the four look over the Eternity Devil's teeth chomping below. "Give me Denji's Heart." it demanded.

"Someone kill Denji!! Please!! Kill him!!" screamed Kobeni to the four across them as Arai also pleaded, "We're **really** in trouble now... Let's feed him to the devil!"

`"Tch. No! Denji must not die here. He should be killed by me!"` shouted Yoru while subtly influencing Asa to be more angry. 

"I'll use the sword, do I have *your* permission, Himeno?" asked Aki, before Himeno restrained him with her ghost hands. "**Himeno?!**" he shouted, strained as Denji questioned, "Hey, what the heck are you doing?!" Himeno explains, "If Aki uses the sword, we can probably get outside. But per the terms of the contract, using it will cut his life span down by a lot. There are still so many things Aki has to do..." Himeno looked at Denji. "**I'm sorry, Denji.**"

Kobeni and Arai arrive from behind them, as Asa quickly tackled Arai down with surprising strength as Power also arrived, laughing. Kobeni tried to stab Denji, but ended up stabbing Aki at his right side, just below his arm. Asa looked at Arai, as red eyes and scars over her face slowly faded in. *"Don't even think about it."* warned Yoru to Arai, glaring at him and clutching his collar before she let him go as Asa faded back in, shaken.

"Yes, he's disgusting scum. I wouldn't blame you for stabbing but he's out to kill the Gun Devil. I can't kill the Gun Devil alone. To kill that thing, I need as many devil hunters with the guts to confront it, as we can get!" explained Aki, looking resolute.

"Power!" Denji turned to look at Power. "You're a blood fiend, right? Can you stop the bleeding?" asked Denji, as Power replied, "I can only control my own blood freely! Controlling another's blood is a difficult feat..." Power moves to Aki. "But if topknot dies, I won't have a human to cook for me. So I suppose I must!"

Asa is dazed as she leans back to a wall as Himeno collapses to the floor. "What do we do? **What do we do?!**" Himeno starts tearing up. "Aki—A—A—Ak—Aki! **What do we do?!**" Kobeni panics and screams, "Th—this isn't my fault!" Kobeni steps back and looks at Denji. "It's you! It's your fault! If you had just been good and gotten eaten, everything would be fine!!"

"All right already! Fine! I'll go get eaten!" said Denji, as he headed to the edge of where the devil lies below. "But F.Y.I., I ain't going down without a fight! And if I do kill that devil dead..." Denji looks at Himeno. "I want my kiss. I haven't forgotten about that, got it?" Power asks, "Do you have a strategy to beat it?" Denji looks to the devil below and answers, "It's gonna hurt like hell, but I'll bust out the **chainsaws.**"

"Dunno why, but that devil's scared of my chainsaws! So scared that it doesn't want to mess with me! That's why it keeps trying to get you guys to kill me!"

`"Weak. Honourless. The Chainsaw Devil faced off against us and almost won against me."` Yoru huffs. `"I don't doubt him. He'll probably win."`

Denji looked back at the group and said, "**If it hates pain so much, I can just torment it until it wants to die. I'll make it kill itself!**" with a slight grin. Everyone stares at him except Power who comments, "Now you're thinking like a devil!" Denji turned back to the devil below, while referring to Aki. "You shielded me... Mind your own business, jerk-face. I'm sick and tired of owning anybody any debts." Denji pulls his chest ripcord. *"If we get out of here, you and me are even!!"* Denji drops down, still grinning.

Asa goes to the edge as well to look down.`"Don't die on me. I still need you."` commented Yoru before Denji got bit by the Eternity Devil. "Denji..." mumbled Asa, as she looked down in shock.

### Author's Note:

Whew. That was a... long and hard journey to write. You know, when writing this I am still not confident but, I got comfortable with just.. writing it down and trying my best. After all, I can still edit it when I publish it, right?

Um, some small commentary. I switched to more consistent formatting about.. halfway? I thought that, it was unnecessary to specify between thoughts and words when formatting with rich text. You can also just figure out fairly easily who is active based on the name used too. 

Oh, and the canon dialogue is mostly from the manga due to how I paced the story. I use the anime for visualization and checking when the manga isn't enough, and also when the EN translation's a bit off. But it mostly works fine.

As for why this took long.. Well, it's ~5000 words y'know? That takes time. I think I worked sparsely over the last weeks then when I got some free time I dove in and pretty much finished it in a day or two. Exams and a personal injury by a leg sprain also didn't help... Ao3 Author Curse has struck me! But, I'm recovering so, that's all good now.

That's pretty much it for my notes. I have a lot other things to say, but I'll have to keep it to myself for now due to story reasons, sorry, maybe when I feel like it~ Like, when I finish an arc or something. Anyways, that's it, enjoy life~!

Schedule: Monthly! (Can be biweekly, but depends on the length of the chapter..)

_Denji pops up, looking like exactly the Chainsaw Devil Yoru imagined, except in a hybrid form._

`"Interesting. This isn't the full devil form."` Yoru speculated as she and Asa watched Denji tear through the **Eternity Devil's** flesh. `"He must be some sort of hybrid or fiend."` continued Yoru, as the two witness Denji continue to fight despite losing his right arm, before pulling on his ripcord for more. 

"This looks bad." commented Power beside Aki. "Denji is losing blood fast. If he loses too much, his chainsaws will retract!"

**"You are weaker than you once were!! A pity!! Chainsaw!!"** the devil taunted.

`"Oh? That's.."` Yoru trailed off as Asa felt Yoru contemplate a lot more than usual. `"Good to know. That means, I have a chance! Once I get it, I can finally eliminate the Chainsaw Man!"` spoke Yoru, grinning before seeing Denji's arms lose their chainsaws which instantly turns her focused. `"Idiot! Just—"` Yoru then saw Denji bite the devil and use it's blood to pull back out his chainsaws and continue tearing apart the devil while saying, "Even blood as gross as sewer water, would taste like strawberry jam if I drank it while seein' your face all twisted in paiiiin!!"

"Hey.. um, I'm.. curious, you say you're so powerful, but.. wouldn't it be faster to just help Denji here?" asked Asa, as Yoru sat beside Asa. `"As I suspected, I am quite weaker inhabiting you, and since war is less feared..."` explained Yoru, as she looked at Asa. `"You're gonna help. But right now, this.. Denji can take care of the current threat. Also, Control leashed you, there is not much we can do but navigate her dealings."` Yoru looks to the group behind, as Asa also does. `"We need to survive and get more strength first."`

---

"Aki, are you still alive...?" asked Himeno to a fully laid down, with blanket and pillow Aki, who is just waking up. "How much... How much time has passed...?" replied Aki back, as Himeno answered. "It's been... maybe three days...?"

As Power calls for, "Meowy..." Himeno slides in beside Aki. "Let's all go... drinking together... It's over, so I'm gonna sleep a bit..." Aki asked, "It's over...?" as the group looks downward to see Denji, blood soaked and standing over the devil, whom is begging.

"This is my core, it's my heart... Please hurry up and kill me, I can't take any more pain.. I'm sorry, it hurts!" pleaded the devil. **"What, it's already over?!"** taunted Denji. **"But it felt great, like takin' a dip in a pool! Too bad!!"** continued Denji before finishing the devil off with a slice to it's core.

---

Everyone is left tired and exhausted, as Denji is left with blood soaked clothes and Power is carrying an injured Aki.

"We made it out..." said Denji, before holding up a bullet-like object. "We got a piece of the Gun Devil too. And it's sunny, feels like I just took a nice dump..." Denji was smiling contentedly. "It's like I'm floating..." trailed off Denji, before Himeno catched his body. 

"I gotcha." Himeno took a closer look at Denji and softly smiled. "Well, he did keep fighting that devil for days on end without any sleep..." Himeno carries Denji on her back. "We'll take Aki and Denji to the hospital. You three go report this incident." Himeno looked at Arai, Kobeni and Asa.

---

"Aki." Himeno asks as they were walking back to Public Safety HQ, as Aki pocketed a Gun Devil Fragment. "I have been meaning to ask, did you see how Asa tackled Arai? We've both seen her smack that Fish Devil, she's.. she's somethin' special." said Himeno, as Aki nodded. "Yeah, thought I was going to have to push off Arai too."

"This girl... why is she in Public Safety?" pondered Aki, as Himeno speculated. "Makima assigned her to you, right? There must be some importance of Asa to Ms. Makima, like Denji." Aki hummed in consideration before nodding. "Himeno, did you see anything else from Asa? She was behind me so.." Himeno recounted, "I.. was looking at her as she looked, angry almost, some.. scars I think appeared before she pulled back." 

Himeno looked at Aki and commented. "It's weird, I don't think I've seen her do that before, even when we hunted devils down." Aki smokes the cigarette before adding, "Arai was about to kill Denji. That might be why, the reason being.." Himeno nodded. "Got it! We'll also see what Asa does with the whole squad! Hmm, maybe she likes Denji?" Aki shook his head slightly, "Maybe, but if she does, we don't know much. We'll see."

---

`"So, there's a.. party. For the new dogs of Makima?"` reiterated Yoru, as Asa was wearing a simple long dark coloured t-shirt with pants while walking to the shop where people said it'd take place. "Well, yeah. I.. really didn't wanna go, but.. I heard free food and.." Asa groaned. "..I'll just.. not speak to anybody." Yoru huffed before poking at Asa's cheek. `"Get close to Denji. He's the one I'm looking for. If we befriend him, maybe we can turn him against Control, then I can kill him."` Asa looked down and hesitated before replying, "How? He's an *irritating idiot*, I haven't even spoken to him directly?"

`"Ugh, and I thought you were supposed to handle the 'blending' into human society part."` commented Yoru as Asa entered the shop and looked around, seeing a lot of people she knew and didn't know. Asa decided to sit (in 'Seiza') beside Denji to her right and some random scarred guy to her left. She mostly picked off the food little by little as she tried her hardest not to talk anyone. As Asa ate, she was glancing at Denji who seemed to be focused at eating and decided she wasn't going to interrupt him on that.

`"Oh, come on, Asa.."` commented Yoru, as Asa continued eating. She did as little contact and speaking as possible and avoided looking at anyone's view except occasionally checking if Denji was available, which he wasn't. This lasted for a while, as Kobeni came in apologizing, "Sorry... I got lost..." before sitting down nearby as the party continued.

"Cheeers!" exclaimed everybody holding a beer mug toasted. The group settles down as Himeno says, "Makima said she'll be late!"

`"I do wonder why she's late..."` commented Yoru, as she continued eating. "I dunno.. but, it's been a while, why hasn't Denji at least acknowledged I exist..?" mumbled Asa, as she glanced at Denji who is looking with awe at a plate of food. `"He doesn't know you. Try. Talking."` answered Yoru, as Asa was still staring at Denji. "Hey." the man on her left called out and looked at her direction.

`"I hope that isn't me..??"` thought Asa before Denji grabbed a menu book. "Hey! You're young, so order more!! Eat!!" the man called out to Denji who responded, "Argh, darnit! I can't read most of this!" Asa was panicking before relaxing when she realized it was Denji, not her being called out. "Whew. Good." mumbled Asa as Denji put the menu book down and she took it, ordering. "More Fried Chicken." she says simply, before putting it down as the man looks at her and orders more too. "Me too. Fried Chicken, please!"

The man next to Asa after getting his fried chicken then states to Denji, who was talking to Himeno that, "This is your welcome party, newbies, stand up and introduce yourselves! State your **name, age** and what **devil** you have a **contract** with!" Aki reminds, "Don't say the devil you've contracted with in public places. You should only reveal your hand to trustworthy people."

`"Heh. If they knew yours, I think they'd kill you, huh Asa?"` Yoru grinned as Asa nods, from the outside, seemingly agreeing with Aki. A female officer right beside the man on his right ordered a beer before adding, "I want to know their hobbies. Hobbies tell you a lot about a person."

Denji goes first, "I'm Denji! I think I'm 16 years old! My hobbies are... eating and sleeping." The others comment, "You're 16?!" then, "Oh my god! That's so young!" before Himeno asked Denji, "You haven't had any alcohol, right?" as Denji clarified, "I got tea."

`"Young, and simple. Huh, no wonder he's under Makima's leash.."` commented Yoru, as Asa also muttered under her breath. "He's as old as me..." Asa couldn't follow the discussion after Arai introduced himself, before Kobeni stood up. "I'm Kobeni Higashiyama, I'm 20... My devil is..a secret. My hobby is eating tasty things." she introduced herself, as a female officer commented, "Isn't her dress cute?" to a glass-wearing guy. "This is my big sister's hand-me-down." clarified Kobeni, before the woman also added, "Kobeni is one of nine sisters. Isn't that amazing?"

Everyone turned to look at Asa, as her eyes widened before standing up. "I'm.. Mitaka Asa. I'm 16.. My devil's also a secret, and.. uhh, my hobby is.. looking at cats..?" she introduced herself. "Ah? She's young too?" commented the female officer, as Aki nodded. "She's quite good at fighting, also strong, can be quite timid though." added Aki, as Asa looked at Kobeni and she smiled awkwardly as solidarity with the other younger nervous wreck. 

Asa sits back down as Himeno asked, "Hwuuuh? Fushi, where's your newbie?" to the man next to Aki. "Unfortunately, they died yesterday." Himeno babbled, "R.I.P.! Rest.. Resht in... peash?" as Aki commented to Himeno, "You're already drunk." Arai looked at Fushi beside Aki and asked, "Do new recruits die that easily...?"

"The devils the civilian hunters couldn't handle get passed to Public Safety." answered Fushi as the female officer added, "Mm, people drop like flies. None of the people who started the same time as me are with Public Safety anymore either."

`"Of course, why would Makima want to deal with such low-level devils that don't even have a single fragment of the Gun Devil?"` commented Yoru to Asa. `"But.. once we get all of them, won't she have a large fragment that'll be used against us?"`Asa responded, as Yoru scoffed. `"I know that. We can't do much about it, their 'mission' is to apparently eliminate it. All we can do is develop our own strength and hope I can steal it back."`

Makima enters the shop, and whispered something to Denji before pulling back.

"Excuse me. One draft beer, please." Makima says as she takes off her coat. "Sit here, Miss Makima." said Aki, as he laid down a mat for her to kneel on. 

`"Look who's decided to show herself."` Yoru thought as Asa looked at Makima, she also looking back and smiled before turning to Denji. "Denji, are you going to kiss someone?" questioned Makima as Denji shouted, **"HELL NO!"**

`"See, Asa? This is how you talk to Denji. She's.. just too good at it, tch."` commented Yoru as Makima kept asking Denji, "So, what's this about a kiss?"
