"Chainsaw Devil, wherever you are.." Yoru says as she looks around the alley. "I'll make you vomit Nuclear Weapons back up!" continued Yoru as she sat down on a devil's corpse and smiled confidently.

---

"What?!" Yoru exclaimed to Asa, as they walked home. "What do you mean there's no Chainsaw Devil?! There is. And I'm going to find him." reiterated Yoru, as they bump into Makima and some Public Safety officers. "Watch where you're—" Asa seea Makima's face. "..going." Asa looks at Makima looking at her as Makima was smiling. "We detected a Devil's presence here.." Makima says as she looks around her, and finds the alleyway Asa was from. "It seemed to have come from that alleyway."

Makima then turns to Asa. "You.. wouldn't happen to know what happened, miss?" Asa is already panicking as she just woke up, her hands shaking while Yoru cautiously watches Makima's movement silently. "N—no?" answered Asa, as Yoru cursed Asa for being terrible with tension. "Hm, I'll.. send the other two to investigate the alleyway, stay here." Makima says, before turning to the other two people with her and sending them to the alleyway as the two are left alone on the sidewalk.

The two look at each other, Asa trying to form an awkward smile but failing and Makima looking at her, still smiling. Then, as the two enter the alleyway. "I didn't expect you'd be.. descending this early, _**War.**_" Yoru was a bit surprised and Asa took a step back in utter shock and overwhelm, as Yoru took over Asa's body.

"So, you have found me, **_Control._**" said Yoru, narrowing her eyes. "Have you found the Chainsaw Devil?" asked Yoru, clenching her fists. Makima continued to smile, as she nodded and answered, "Yes. _He's mine_."

`Asa (to Yoru): W—what?! Control Devil too?!`

"Ms. Makima! There appears to be a devil's corpse, but no devil has been found." said one of the officers as Makima nodded and looked away from Yoru. "Very well. I suppose one of the other Private Devil Hunters must have took it out." Makima looks at Asa again. "But, I do want to speak to this girl to learn more." Makima extends her right hand. "Come with me to Public Safety." Yoru looks at Makima's right hand, and nods. "Let's go." Yoru shakes her hand aggressively before both pulled back.

---

"What is your full name?"

"Asa Mitaka." 

"Contract?"

"..."

"War Devil."

---

Asa enters Makima's office, wearing a baggy top with a t-shirt underneath and black pants. "Ms. Makima." Asa walks and sits in front of Makima. "Ms. Mitaka." said Makima, with a smile. "..or should I say, _War?"_ asked Makima, as Yoru took over Asa immediately, sensing the tense situation.

"..hello," Yoru visibly has red facial scars. "Control." Yoru's face is neutral. "So, why are you joining Public Safety..?" asked Makima, as Yoru was silent before smiling and saying, "..to avenge my family." Makima was silently pondering before nodding. "Family..? How.. poignant. Then, prove your usefulness to Public Safety." Yoru remained neutral as she nodded before Makima added, "..just know, War..." Makima smiled. "..this is _my_ territory."

Yoru scoffs but nods. "..I know that." Makima then leans in, "Then you must know, _Yoru,_ that I have.. eyes and ears everywhere..?" Yoru clenches her fists, nods again, before looking at Makima's eyes. "..I know that." she repeated. Makima looks at Yoru's eyes, same as hers, as Yoru looks back silently before Makima sits down. "Go. As a.. courtesy, I'll keep our little secret," Makima smiles at Yoru again. "for now. Do.. ensure it remains advantageous for me, Yoru." Yoru stands up. "Tch. I will." Yoru turns to leave, "There'll be a day where I'll win, Control." Yoru leaves as Makima broadened her smile, and commented, "Do so."

`W—what did you say to her?! We're going to die!` Asa said to Yoru, as she shut her up. "Silence. We **won't**." 

 

---

"Aki." Makima calls, as the two were at her office. "I have a new.. rookie that I want you to patrol with, for today." Makima pauses, before saying, "..Her name is Asa Mitaka." Asa opens the door, seeing Aki and Makima. "Hello.." Asa says as she walks beside Aki. "Asa, make friends during your time in Public Safety, okay?" asked Makima to Asa, before Asa reluctantly nodded. Aki scrutinized Asa before looking at Makima. "She's.. a human, Ms. Makima, why is **she** in the Special Division?"

Makima smiled, looking at Asa before looking at Aki. "She has.. a very _special_ secret devil contracted. I think it'd be best to put her here." Aki looked at Asa, who was looking down, fiddling with her shirt. "Okay, Ms. Makima."

---

The two were walking down a street as Asa held a metal pipe for a weapon. "Asa," Aki calls Asa, as Asa looks at him, neutral. "being a public safety officer is hard. You should be vigilant, and alert." Asa nods quietly, as Aki looks at Asa's metal pipe. "I don't know what your contract is, but it better be useful to Public Safety and Ms. Makima." said Aki, before they continued walking silently.

`Tch. Who does this guy think he is?` said Yoru to Asa, as Yoru appeared as a hallucination, walking beside Asa to her right, while Aki was on the left. `Some nerve, while serving as Makima's dog.` Asa mumbled, "We.. are in that situation, though.." Asa elaborated, "..you know, we could've stayed in High School.." Yoru responded, `Control is too much of a threat to ignore.` Yoru looks at some people walking near them. `If she was weak, then we could have stayed.`

"B—but is confronting her the way..?" asked Asa to Yoru. `Yes. If left unchecked, she'll erase War, Famine, Death..` Asa thinks, before asking, "Isn't that a good thing..?" Yoru responds, `And you'll be dead.` Asa's silent as they continue walking.

Aki sees Asa mumbling to herself, gripping the metal-pipe shaking, he sighs as they continue walking.

---

"Himeno." Aki says as he and Asa meet up with Himeno, and two other public safety officers. "Aki~" Himeno's eye raised when she sees Asa. "Oh? A new rookie? What's her name?" Himeno asks Aki, as he looks at Asa, expectantly. "Ah—? Um, I'm Asa Mitaka." said Asa to Himeno, as she smiled and looked at her holding the metal pipe for dear life. "Heh, she got into the special division?" asked Himeno to Aki, as they started to walk.

"Yes. Directly assigned by Makima." answered Aki, as Asa fell into step with the other two at the back, who she intentionally avoided facing. "Oh? Then.. she's another special interest?" continued Himeno, as Aki nodded. "She has a secret devil contract." answered Aki as he side-eyed Asa. "What devil is so special to Miss Makima that she assigned the girl here, I don't know." finished Aki, as Himeno nodded.

"A devil sighted on—" Asa couldn't hear the garbled location, "—at—" nor the time engagement from the walkie-talkie Aki took out.

"Let's go." Aki says to all of them.

`Yoru (to Asa): These are the rest of Makima's pawns? Hm, let's stick with them until we find the Chainsaw Devil.` Asa nodded.

---

"Kon." said Aki, holding up an iconic fox gesture at the Leech Devil holding up Denji as it was eaten by the Fox Devil then they asked, "This's the Leech Devil. Can I swallow it?" Aki answered, "You may." before they disappeared. "Leech Devil's extermination confirmed." Aki turns to Asa, and the other two newbie officers. "Newbies, aid and evacuate the survivors!" Asa answered, "Yes, sir." as the other two did as well. Asa moved with them to civilians as Asa overheard, "Himeno, as our senior..." before it trailed off.

`Yoru (to Asa): First work as an officer, Asa. And it's.. to..` Yoru looks at Asa disappointedly. `"..to aid civilians."` Yoru sighs. `"Just finish and don't mess it up."` Yoru looks around. `"The Chainsaw Devil might be nearby."` Asa stops in her tracks as she looks at where Aki is carrying some badly beat up guy, but they're turned away from her so she can't see who Aki is carrying on his shoulders. "I wonder who's that..?" mumbled Asa to herself, as Yoru looks at Asa, determined. 

`Yoru (to Asa): We will figure it out.` before Asa goes and tries to help the other two.

---

Asa is silently waiting at the hospital, leaning on the wall as Himeno sits down next to some red horned girl who's handcuffed. "Asa?" Himeno looks up at Asa, looking down at the floor. "Are you not assigned to any patrol?" asked Himeno, as Asa nodded respectfully. "Ms. Makima hasn't assigned me any, so I've just been helping around.." explained Asa, as the red-horned girl looked at her. "Hey human!"

Asa looks at the girl. "Huh?" The girl continues, "Get me out of these cuffs!" Himeno steps between Asa and the girl as she maintains her view of Asa. "Don't. She's currently cuffed because she left _someone_ to die." explained Himeno, before looking at the girl. "Just.. wait, Power. Aki'll determine if you're innocent." Power groans and tries to get out of her cuffs but to no avail and just whines before being resigned. Himeno sits back sown as Asa looks back down.

`"Power, huh? I wonder what Fiend this is, being controlled by humans like that.` Yoru thought loudly to Asa.

_Aki opens the door._

"See? I told you I was innocent!" Power holds her cuffed hands up. "Now that you know it, get these things off me!" Aki looks at Himeno. "You sure about this?" asked Himeno as she looked at Power then Aki. "If little Miss Fiend here kills somebody one day, it'll be on you for looking the other way, Aki." continued Himeno, as she sees Aki go and uncuff Power. "We are Devil Hunters." said Aki as Himeno stood up. "We ought to use every tool at our disposal to do our job—even devils and fiends." Aki glares at Power, who is checking her wrists.

"But enemies are enemies..." Aki maintains his stare. "We're _only_ using them. I have no intention of _getting friendly_ with them." Aki turns away as Himeno follows. Asa and Power look at each other then follow.

`"..Aki sounds scary honestly."` Asa says to Yoru, mumbling. `"Coward. But he makes sense. I have no intention of getting friendly either."` replies Yoru, as Power notices Asa's mumbling. Asa finishes with, "Hah, yeah.. it's.. very stressful."

---

_Asa spends the next few days with Aki and Himeno.._

Asa smacks the Fish Devil surprisingly hard with her metal pipe as Aki finishes it off and gets a silver bullet from its guts.

"Found one." said Aki as he stood on the devil's body as Asa was breathing heavily soaked in blood. "Huh, nice rookie." Himeno was looking at Asa before she jumped up to sit on the devil's head. "Ah." Himeno puts her right hand on her chin as she begins to talk, "Figured it'd eaten one of that damn gun's chunks."

`Yoru (to Asa): Gun?`

**"But.. did it _eat_ that... or was it _fed_ that?"** pondered Himeno loudly.

`Yoru (to Asa): "How can some lowly devil eat a part of the Gun Devil?` Asa is taken aback. "The.. Gun Devil?" asked Asa to Yoru, mumbling again. `"Gun Devil Fragments. From your memories, I learnt that it disappeared from the face of the earth."` Yoru makes Asa focus on what Aki is holding. `"Though, it likely disintegrated and its fragments scattered."` Asa nods. "Yeah.." 

"Hey, rookie." Himeno called Asa, as she looked at Himeno, a bit dazed. "We're going back to HQ." Himeno looks at Aki. "Let's go." continued Himeno, as Aki looked at Asa suspiciously before sighing as the two got off the Fish Devil. "Let's give the fragment to Ms. Makima as well. Come on." Aki and Himeno walk forward as Asa followed, blinking quickly. 

"_She's_ collecting them?!" Yoru commented `to Asa`, as she nodded. "What _is_ she planning.." Yoru trailed off as they look at Asa and Himeno talking about something Asa can't hear.

---

_As Himeno and Aki left the office, and Asa was going to follow.._

"Asa.." said Makima as Asa stopped in her tracks. "Y—yes, Ms. Makima?" asked Asa, turning to face her. "Sit down, I want to have a little _chat_ about our current goals at Public Safety." commanded Makima, Asa nods politely and sits down in front of her. "As you have seen, we've been collecting **Gun Devil Fragments.**" Makima smiled. "But I haven't told you the reason." Makima stands up and looks at the window, turning her back to Asa.

"I'm sure you know of the Gun Devil incident thirteen years ago.." Makima side-eyes Asa, who was shaking. "Right now, Public Safety is collecting its fragments to find and eliminate it." Makima turns to Asa, smiling. "I'm sure that won't.. cause problems in the future, _Yoru?"_ Asa gasps as Yoru takes over. "..and what _exactly_ are you implying?" asked Yoru, as she stood up, facing off Makima. "Nothing, _nothing_." Makima sits down, looking away as Yoru does.

"How **is** Special Division Four?" Makima sips coffee. Yoru eyes Makima as she answers, "Boring. I've been fighting low-level devils that take a single hit to kill." Yoru smiles. "Is that all you have planned, _Control?"_ Makima smiled faintly as she looked back. "Remember that at anytime, I can.. _inform_ of your presence, Yoru." commented Makima, as she looked at the door behind Yoru. "I can make you a.. _threat_ to Japan and.. **Public Safety**." Makima looks at Yoru. "We.. wouldn't want that, right _Asa?"_

`"Y—Yoru?! We—we'll die if you keep—"`Asa says to Yoru before she silenced her. "Fine." Yoru stands up. "But I _will_ win. You will not restrain me!" Yoru storms out as Makima sips her coffee, content.

`"W—what are you thinking?! If you keep talking to her like that, we might *just* die! Then your plans of defeating the Chainsaw Devil won't become reality! *You* pushed me to join, so *figure* out how to save us!"` Asa rants to Yoru, as Yoru was clenching her fists. "I'm trying." said Yoru, as she glared at Asa's hallucinated form. "But first.." Yoru looks at the door to Makima's office. "..we need to find the _Chainsaw Devil._"

---

"Devil Extermination Request for Public Safety."

"Devil Sighting inside Morino Hotel. Survival of Hotel Guests is unknown. According to the request, multiple civilian devil hunters have died in extermination attempts. Movement from a Gun Devil piece confirmed. It's likely a devil has ingested another piece. Dispatching seven hunters from Public Safety Extermination Special Division 4."

Asa is behind Aki, while a tall man looks at her neutrally. She can see Himeno teasing a girl while Power argues with some dumb blonde guy.

`"Let's kill this devil."` said Yoru, as Asa nodded. "Yeah, I hope.." Asa mumbled, as they continued walking.

### Author's Note:

So, I'm a bit nervous about posting this. I re-read it like **only** twice so I'm worried this isn't good, but here! It's a start! To set expectations, this part is going to focus on the Public Safety Arc, and that's the current scope. I *can* continue to Part 2, through the earlier arcs, but that's for the future, and what the manga would do, so yeah.

I apologise if any details here are a bit loose, or uncharacteristic, I haven't mastered writing Chainsaw Man. Any criticism is welcome, I'm trying to be as accurate as possible, while allowing creative choices as part of the AU. This covers the Intro and Bat Devil Arc, and some backstory to describe Asa and Yoru but not fully. I know the cliffhanger is like, somewhat irritating but trust me! I'll complete it.. **someday!** 

Schedule: Monthly! (Can be biweekly, but depends on the length of the chapter..)

Anyways, that's it, enjoy life~!

"A devil is lurking somewhere inside this hotel." explained Aki as he looked at the group behind him. "And it's not just any devil, either." Aki gestures to the Gun Devil Fragment dangling from his hands being pulled to the direction of the hotel. "This piece of the Gun Devil's flesh is being pulled toward it." Aki's look gets a _bit_ grimmer. "There must be a devil that ingested another piece here."

"You sure the Gun Devil itself ain't here?" asked the dumb blonde guy before Aki answered, "The larger the chunk, the stronger the pull." Aki sternly glanced at the guy. "This pull is too weak for that."

"Hey.. Asa, is it?" the tall stern guy who Asa noticed has a scar on his left cheek. "Y—yeah?" responded Asa, as the guy extended his hand. "I haven't introduced myself, I'm Arai," Arai smiles faintly. "Arai Hirokazu." Arai points to the girl shaking while Himeno is speaking to her. "That's Kobeni Higashiyama, I'm sure you two will get along." Then he turns to the blonde guy and red-horned girl. "Those are the.. devils fighting with us. The girl's Power, the guy's name's Denji."

Arai steps into Aki's view. "Sir.. can we..."

`Yoru (to Asa): Hm, Asa.. those two. Power, and Denji.. They say that they're devils of some sort.. Maybe we can identify what Devil they are if we ask them. Maybe they know where the Chainsaw Devil is.` Asa is a bit surprised, "Didn't take you for a talker, but.." Asa looks at Denji and Power whispering loudly to each other. "..yeah.. It's probably less awkward to talk to them."

"**THAT! was way beyond a prank!!**" Aki shouted, raising his hand to point at Denji and Power. "**I'll KILL YOU!!**" Himeno walks beside Aki, confused. "Scary... What the heck happened...?" Himeno glances at Aki before looking at Denji. "C'mon Aki, you can't be strict with them all the time." Denji adds, "Yeah what she said! That bat almost killed me, and now it's straight back to work!" Denji moves his hands to his sides. "Gimme a reward!"

`Yoru (to Asa): This is painfully annoying. Even I can sense you hate listening to this.` Asa nods. "Ugh, I have to speak to them.." Asa narrows her eyes. "This is gonna be a drag.." Asa looks around just as Himeno gets close to Kobeni. `"You're not going to like Himeno, hm?"` Yoru smiled. `"Just look at that Kobeni human."` Asa shudders. "I wish I could say I'll push her away but.." 

"I already decided who my first kiss is gonna be." said Denji, as he looked to the side of Aki. "Like, I'm gonna collect these meat chunks or whatever for her..." Denji lazily looks at Himeno. "...and then murderize the Gun Devil. I'm not smooching anybody till then."

Yoru narrows her eyes as Asa looks at Denji. `"He's.. going to kill the Gun Devil?"` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Is this Makima's doing?"` Yoru thinks harder. `"Or maybe that Power girl, but.."`

Kobeni appears in front of Asa. "Oh, um.. I saw you.. just standing there mumbling to yourself, shaking..." Kobeni smiles, still shaking. "Are you also scared of the devils?" Asa hesitated to answer before nodding. "Yeah.." Kobeni turns to walk towards the rest of the group. "Let's go.. do our job." said Kobeni in a sad way that made Asa immediately feel pity for her, as she follows.

---

Asa is at Power's left and behind Kobeni as they walk inside the hotel.

"**Acting independently is dangerous!! Stop!!** Arai chases Denji, before managing to pin him.

Asa overhears Kobeni's nervous mumblings and Power's blood mumblings.

But then Denji scuffled with him as Arai continued, "Himeno has trained me for half a year. I'm in her debt!" Arai keeps pressing his right elbow on Denji's right hand. "If some punk from who knows where is going to steal her lips..." Denji's left hand is trying to push Arai on his left shoulder. "Move it!!" Denji pushes harder but fails to budge an inch. "I don't want some guy pressing up against me!! It's creepy!! Go to hell!!" Denji finally manages to push Arai back. "You and I got different burdens, man!!"

Asa sighs as Yoru side-eyes Power. `"Blood.."` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Asa, Power might be the Blood Fiend."` Asa mumbled, "Huh?" Yoru makes Asa look at Power. `"Red horns, a feature of a fiend.. and she's looking for blood while completely unharmed.."` Asa gulped, as she overheard Aki and Himeno talking.

"As for Denji... Too many unknown factors. It's still too soon to say." said Aki, before looking at Power. "The Blood Fiend's strong, but a hothead. It's still possible she'll betray us." Aki looks directly at Asa's back as she tried to maintain her walking stride. "Asa.. I don't know what her deal is, but she's like Kobeni. Timid, but pretty strong." Aki stops to think before saying, "You've seen her keep up with us before."

"Hm." Himeno then asks, "Think these five newbies can **survive?**" Aki answers immediately, "Most people either die, or go private after a year, regardless of how strong I thought they were." Himeno responded with, "You sure dodged the question..." Himeno pauses before saying, "**Don't you die, Aki.**"

Everyone suddenly stops in their tracks as a front and nearby door slowly creaks open.

`Yoru (to Asa): Finally. A devil."` Asa tenses up.

The devil looks to be a head with a foot and hand attached to the left and right, respectively. 

It jumps up as it passes over Kobeni anxiously avoiding it as Himeno stops it using some invisible force. "Caught you." said Himeno, as Asa hears someone running and turns to see Power making a blood weapon. " 'Tis a battle!" said Power as she slices the devil in half. Kobeni is panicking just as Power commented, "The damn devil froze in midair out of fear of me!" before laughing maniacally.

"No, No, No. That was my power!" Himeno puts her right hand on her chest. "My **ghost** caught it!" said Himeno, as Power was confused. "Ghost?" she asked. "I have a contract with the **Ghost Devil.**" answered Himeno, as she pointed to her eyepatch and began explaining.

"Ghost Devil.." Asa mumbled to Yoru, as she looked at Himeno. `"Interesting."` uttered Yoru, pausing before commenting, `"It's strong, but weaker than me."` before Asa was brought back to reality.

"Gotcha..." said Himeno, looking at Aki. "Let's move up a floor then!"

Asa tunes out Power and Himeno as she walks and talks with Yoru. "So far so easy.." mumbled Asa as they continued climbing. `"It likely isn't the devil itself. Stay focused."` reiterated Yoru, looking around. `"You might be walking into a trap, considering how it didn't show its true self when all of you entered."` speculated Yoru, before Asa stopped when Power had a blood weapon on and was being choked by Himeno using her ghost arm.

Himeno pulls back her ghost arm as Power coughs and they start walking again. "I don't wanna have to do that again so how about we get along?" warned Himeno, before Power commented to Denji, "I'll eat her one of these days!" Denji responds, "Hey, she's gonna kiss me. Don't eat her!" 

Arai suddenly stops as everybody does so too. "Wait, Huh...?" exclaimed Arai, before Aki asks, "What is it?" Arai looks at the sign saying 'Floor 8' then continues, "Just now... didn't we go up the stairs from the eighth floor to the ninth?" Aki answers, "Yeah." Arai worryingly says, "This is floor eight too!" Denji questions, "You didn't see wrong or count wrong?" Arai's determined and answered, "No! I'll go double-check!" Asa sees Arai rush downstairs only to appear upstairs soon after.

"Oh no.." Asa mumbled as Yoru pondered, `"Interesting. I can probably bust out of here, but.."` Asa looks at Himeno who also tried going down only to end upstairs too. "Aki... What the hell is this...?" questioned Himeno to Aki. "Probably a devil's power." answered Aki before rushing to a room's door as the others followed. "Huh?" asked Kobeni as Aki entered and shouted, "Kobeni! Stay right there!"

Asa herself went to the opposite room, looking around, finding a window as Aki appears seemingly behind it. "Asa..?" Aki goes through the window and passes by Asa, who was frozen in place, seeing Kobeni outside. "I was afraid of this..." said Aki, as Kobeni turned around and went, "Huh?!" Asa walked near Aki as she saw Denji shout, "Hey! None of the windows lead outside! They're all connected to the rooms on the opposite side!!" Aki sweats as he looks down and utters, **"We're stuck on the eighth floor..."**

---

Asa lays down on the bed of a room beside Kobeni as Aki gives a rundown of the situation. But, right now, Asa is stressing over what is happening.

"Yoru.. can't you do something to let us leave here?" asked Asa to Yoru. `"Probably. But it'll be revealing our power too soon. **Ms. Control** wouldn't like it."` Yoru looks at the others, as Denji speculates on why they're trapped. `"We haven't seen what that Denji boy does."`Yoru looks at Aki and Himeno. `"While we're trapped, we haven't even seen what the devil looks like."` Yoru looks at Asa. `"Besides, we need to exterminate the devil here. It'll probably show itself once it thinks we're weak."`

"We're all going to die here..." Kobeni is internally panicking, but she's visibly shaking. "We're going to starve to death..." Arai moves to her front, encouraging. "K—Kobeni! Stay strong!" said Arai, as Asa looked on, unamused. Yoru comments, `"I wonder why that girl's here."`

"..older brother through college, remember?!" Arai has his fists to his chest, trying to motivate Kobeni. "I was half forced into it..." explained Kobeni, as Asa tensed up a little, getting a little snicker from Yoru. "My parents only care about my gifted brother... They want to put him through college, so they put **_me_** to work..." explained Kobeni, tearing up and voice cracking. "My only options were to be a sex worker or devil hunter!"

"But I wanted to go to college too!!" Kobeni puts her hands on her face. "But I'm gonna die here!!"

"You know.." Asa mumbled to Yoru, as Yoru smiled.
