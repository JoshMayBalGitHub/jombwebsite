// So, how does this work? TODO: If you have free time, find a way to fix it without JS pretty please?
// I dunno. but it waits for page to load, 
// then it simply listens then looks for hash (#), then once the hash is used to do something, do it but after 50 seconds
// Crazy right? IDK why this needed to be used, but.. welp, it's working so.. that's the end of it. — jmb~ | February 28, 2026 
// doesn't work occasionally??? if there are two md-block js, it just breaks..??? — jmb~ | March 21, 2026
