### [DeltaRambles Changelog](stories/deltarambles/CHANGELOG.md)
Note: the below is a ported one from the old wiki
## Website Version's History
### 0.01

The OG, the first version of my website, its called 0.01 because its not that good in my opinion at that time so i started there instead of 1.00 or 0.10 or any of that.

### 0.02B

It was made because for some reason the tag system in Github was not that intuitive to me and i just released what i had to "fix" the problem. The B stands for Beta.

### 0.02F

It was the version that was actually supposed to be the 0.02 release so i named it "0.02F" and F stands for Finished. By this time i probably fixed my tags issue so here the previous version's code was made into the recent version which is a problem but the releases anywasys just included the source code so that didnt matter.

### 0.02.1F

It is the version before i scrapped the old index and made it only accessible in the Github through the releases and the main source code itself. I kept it because i wasn't really gonna do anything about it and hey maybe i will use it soon. Also you might have noticed the new experiment.html, it is the gallery.html and i renamed it for simplicity sake and it wasn't really a gallery.

### 0.03

The current development version. Nothing to say about it.
