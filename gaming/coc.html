    <p class="stitle_coc">NOT UPDATED FOR SOME REASON (BUSY AGAIN) BUT MAIN ACCOUNT IS NOW TH 12</p>
    <p class="text_coc">My Goal? To have three accounts with th9-11, as with research and my own biases playing the game i have concluded that they are the best townhalls to have fun
        with. Since i like playing the game a little too much, i also made a page for it (<b>this one</b>). I will also be tracking what i am doing in these bases weekly, and images..
        Either weekly or when something interesting happens.
    </p>
    <p class="stitle_coc"><i>1st Account: Town Hall 10 (To 11)</i></p>
    <p class="text_coc">My <i>Main</i> Account. I have been on and off playing this for years (2017, 2020, 2023), currently a brand <i>"new"</i> th10, as i did not wait for those heroes... Though, i have
    a new layout, as i did build all necessary buildings required for base building for th10. Anyways currently working on bomb towers and random stuff. My <i>Goal</i> is to however,
    make this into a th11 base so one more upgrade and we are done, but maxed also. I have not experienced th10-11, so i wiil see what happens. Also siege machines broo..</p>

    <p class="stitle_coc"><i>2nd Account: Town Hall 8 (To 10)</i></p>
    <p class="text_coc">My <i>2nd</i> Account, i started this... around jan 23 2023, and well i have been playing ever since, this gave me a true refreshing experience on what it feels
    like playing for months, from beginning to end (1st account is old and 3rd account is old too). For now just trying to max out and go through the grind... Hope i can do it.</p>

    <p class="stitle_coc"><i>3rd Account: Town Hall 5 (To 9)</i></p>
    <p class="text_coc">My <i>3rd</i> Account, i started this just around may 13 2023, and i got it, when i was just chillin' and i saw a video that inspired me to do this in the first place, HaVoC
    Gaming, and i saw his video about town hall tier list, which made me think about the townhalls, and after researching, i concluded it will  be best for me to stop when i played the game (th 11),
    as the game got progressively longer (2w upgrades really?), so i decide being a free2play, should stop around the golden age. So i got this account from my old stuff and started using it, got 
    it to th5 and have been progressing ever since.</p>
