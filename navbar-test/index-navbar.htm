<p class="text-home">
The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political and economic “rebirth” following the Middle Ages. 
Generally described as taking place from the 14th century to the 17th century, the Renaissance promoted the rediscovery of classical philosophy, literature and art.

<p class="text-home">
  The most important factor is the location of Italy. Italy is located between Western Asia and West Europe. Because of this the city-states in Italy had the opportunity to
  trade with countries in Western Asia and Western Europe. It also helped Italy to receive different philosophies from East and West.<br><br>
  Italy is also the origin of Ancient Rome and all of its greatness. Because of this, Italians also consider Rome as the origin of their blood and language it is more 
  relevant to them than any other European country. Because of this belief, they have more desire to return to classical Roman civilization.<br><br>
  The Italian universities also played an important role, as they promoted and emphasized the classical culture, theological knowledge and the philosophies of Greek and 
  Roman Civilization. By having free studying, people's view of life became practical and became more free to cultivate their abilities and preferences.<br><br>
  They also had 2 Beliefs:<br>
  1. People must be free to cultivate their abilities and prefrence.<br>
  2. People must desire happiness and pleasure in the present.<br> <br>
  Also, people of royal lineage that are diligent in art and learning such as the Medici Family are also important in the Renaissance including the lead person Lorenzo da 
  Medici, who spread the Renaissance by building a public library that became a learning center for painters and sculptors.

<p class="title-home">Humanism</p></div><div class="top-body">
<p class="text-home">
According to the International Humanist and Ethical Union, Humanism's definition is as a democratic or ethical status, which reinforces the view that people have the 
rights and responsibilities to define their own lives as valued.<br><br>
In literary criticism, Humanism recognizes a person's ability to think and decide his own destiny. According to the belief of humanists, a person is the measure of all 
things so it is important to give him the freedom to express his feelings and freedom of decision. <br><br>
The theory of Humanism comes from the humanistic principles and beliefs in literary tradition in Europe during the renaissance where attention is focused on 
valuing people.<br><br>
The Perspective on Humanism:<br>
A person's attitude and feelings are the main subject.<br>
They are supposed to appreciate the freedom of the mind, the unique talents, abilities and human nature.<br>
The purpose of literature about the theory of Humanism is to show that the human species is the center of the world where attention is focused on the strengths 
and good qualities of a person.
