    <h1 id="code">1. 🐧 Linux and Programming</h1>
    <h2 id="code-1">1.1 Programming</h2>
    <p>I started programming around November 2020, as you can see by my GitHub account, and first i started by making C# programs and after a while i was like, dude you
        know what, i should start making websites and when my former classmate and programmer <i>Leuqas</i> started making websites and Javascript stuff, i started doing it, 
        at first, the quality was questionable but i got better and better, and as i did that, i also began to try game engines such as Unity at first, but as i searched
        around, i found <i>LINUX</i>. After that i continued making programs, learning Haskell and making my first GUI program using GTK for Linux. Then started modding 
        python programs. May 6 2023, i started learning a bit of rust and c++ for robotics at our school. That has been my programming journey.</p>
    <h2 id="code-2">1.2 Linux</h2>     
    <p>During that time, i was a newbie and was like installing it at first in virtual machines but after <i>Windows 11</i>, i started making 
        the switch around 2022, and at first it was <i>Pop!_OS</i>, then i started basically using <i>GNOME</i> after disabling Pop extensions and installing my own. But 
        around when <i>COSMIC </i> desktop started to be developed, i was scared of losing my extensions and at this point i had become tired of <i>GNOME</i>'s design and 
        so i found <i>KDE</i>! and switched fully to at first <i>Kubuntu</i>, as by this point, i was still a newbie and was slowly knowing how <i>Linux</i> works. So i
        installed it, but after a while i found out what rolling-release distros are and what is <i>EndeavorOS</i>. I liked it! But i knew i couldn't switch but after a 
        disastrous <i>"experiment"</i> (basically tried to make Ubuntu a rolling-release but realised that it was too unsupported so i tried to revert but nuked it), I
        switched to <i>EndeavorOS with KDE</i> and after one more wipe (not <i>Linux</i> problem), i was finally happy! (ever since December 2022). Also rEFInd better than
        GNU Grub.</p>
    <h1 id="art">2. 🌐 History and Art</h1>
    <p>I am a <i>history</i> nerd, like serious one. But i also draw stuff about it (<i>countryballs</i> or not). You can see it on my yt channel. Maybe a <i>historical</i> 
        game / reference or two, but nothing that i would consider as important as my <i>programming</i>.</p>
    <h1 id="other">3. 🍿 Other Stuff</h1>
    <h2 id="game">3.1 🎮 Gaming</h2>
    <p>I have a bit of experience playing <i>chess</i> and <i>scrabble</i> occasionally when going outside or taking a break from <i>programming</i>, my <i>ELO</i> 
        (chess.com)? <i>200.</i>.. Yeah not much of a good <i>chess</i> player despite being a player for a year now. I got last place in <i>Scrabble</i> in our school 
        competition so not much there right now... As for other (online) games, <i>TF2</i> casual player and <i>CSGO</i> newbie practically. Occasional <i>Valorant</i> and 
        mobile game player.</p>
    <h2 id="music">3.2 🎵 Musical Interests</h2>
    <p>I listen to <i>Sabaton</i> sometimes, a <i>power metal</i> band that has <i>historical</i> themes, you can see why i like them. I also listen to 
        <i>Blacklite District</i>, a <i>rock music</i> artist that produces good songs (in my opinion).
